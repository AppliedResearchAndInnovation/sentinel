833	855	8	8	positive	@Akes_theGambler I think I'm going Hearn. Solid form, 3rd last year, obviously motivated here, and has the favorable Thursday AM draw.
38	38	9	9	negative	@ThePME @DraftKings Would Moore be considered a popular pick? Kuchar too. Moore and Kuch, gotta go.
610	632	12	12	positive	I'm ashamed I only listed Reed as a bonus pick for @TheOpen .... He's gonna contend at 66-1 he is worth more than a sprinkle @ThePME

134	134	3	3	positive	Lo and behold... Rose produced his best putting performance of the season to date to win. So my hunt is for a ball-striker elite.

978	1000	9	9	negative	Got to fade Justin Thomas now because the world is going to own him. Seems about 1500 - 2000 light in price to me.
