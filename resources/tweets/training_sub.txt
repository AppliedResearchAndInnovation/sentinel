1	1	0	0	positive	Bubba will be looking to bomb it away this weekend. After having lost in a playoff the last two years at TPC Scottsdale could this be his year?
2	2	5	5	positive	Pretty tough not to like Snedeker this week in Arizona! In his last 3 starts he has finished tied for 3rd, runner up and a win.
3	3	0	0	positive	J.B. comes into TPC Scottsdale as a two-time winner. It has definitely been a while between dances (2006, 2008) but with Holmes currently ranked 10th in driving distance this season he could once again compete on a course suited to heavy hitters.
4	4	1	1	positive	Sleeper? Kokrak has 3 top 25 finishes in his 7 starts this season and is ranked 9th in driving distance this season. Could he take advantage of a course that favours a long driver of the ball?
5	5	0	1	positive	Patrick Rodgers is an interesting name to keep an eye on this week at the Waste Management Open which rewards length. He leads the tour in Par 5 Eagles and has 4 top 25 finishes in 6 starts this year as well as having made 5 of 6 cuts. At $7,100 on Draft Kings, there are 44 other golfers as or more expensive than Rodgers.

Patrick Rodgers is an interesting name to keep an eye on this week at the Waste Management Open which rewards length.
7	7	37	37	positive	Jason Dufner's all around game has been solid so far this season and he is coming off a big win at the CareerBuilder Challenge only two weeks ago where he finished the tournament at 25 under par. Dufner only ranks 99th in driving distance but this didn't limit his scoring opportunities at La Quinta as he made birdies on 12 of 16 par 5's and many will expect more of the same from Dufner this week at TPC Scottsdale. At $10,700, he may be worth paying up for this week.
8	8	0	0	positive	Piercy has 5-top 25 placings out of 7 starts at the WMPO in his career.
9	9	0	0	positive	Kisner has been on fire to start the year. He has 4 top 10 finishes in 6 starts already (tied for most with Kevin Na) including a 1st and a 2nd. His scoring average of 69.437 is also third on the tour.
10	10	15	15	positive	With a couple of minor blips on the resume at Pebble in 2013 and 2011 DJ's record has been better than solid on this track...2015 = 4th, 2014 = 2nd, 2012 = 5th, 2010 = 1st, 2009 = 1st, 2008 = 7th
11	11	0	0	positive	Walker, a previous winner here in 2014 will be one to watch this week after a 4th place finish in his last start at the Farmer's. In Walker's 5 starts this season he us yet to miss a cut and outside of a 13th place finish at the Sony Open in Hawaii he has finished in the top 10 in 3 out of the 5 starts.
12	12	0	0	negative	Rose missed the cut in his last start at the Farmer's and has not previously played the Pebble Beach Pro Am. Given the amount of multiple winners at Pebble Beach, I have to think that this course demands a level of experience and plays to that advantage.
13	13	11	11	positive	"As a 4 time Champion at Pebble, does anyone think that Phil's most recent finish (-8, that included rounds of 69 and 65) at the Waste Management Open last week in Phoenix makes him a compelling consideration for this week? His last words were ""I'm excited for Pebble Beach"" after all..confidence is not going to be lacking.."
14	14	15	15	positive	As the third highest priced player this week, you'll have to find value elsewhere, but DJ clearly is worth his price based on his Pebble Beach finishes. His play this year (all top 20 results) indicates this trend should continue.
15	15	2	3	positive	At $7700, Bryce Molder is a great value considering over the past 6 years he has finished in the top 15 four times at AT&amp;T Pebble Beach.
16	16	26	27	positive	He may not finish at the top of the leader board necessarily, but if you're in need of a consistent player to fill out your roster, Colt Knost has made the cut in all eight events he has played and has finished in the top 25 in his last 3 starts.
17	17	4	5	positive	Keep an eye on Bryce Molder this week. He is coming off of a T6 placing at the WMPO and has historically played well at the ATT Pro Am, finishing T34 last year (-11) and T10 (-5) in 2014. At $7,700 he is worth consideration in the $7,000 to $8,000 range.
18	18	0	0	positive	Jason Day's ownership level will be interesting to observe this week given his price and recent illness. Day has two top 10 career finishes at the ATT ProAm including a T4 last year. As for his ability to battle through illness, we're talking about a player who almost won the U.S. Open in 2015 while dealing with a severe case of vertigo.
19	19	0	1	positive	J.B. Holmes is 3 for 3 in cuts made this year and is coming off back to back T6 finishes at the Farmers and WMPO. Holmes has 4 career top 20 finishes at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro Am including a T10 last year and a T2 in 2010. At $9,800 there are only 8 golfers more expensive but Holmes is off to a great start this season and seems to be playing some of the best golf of his career.

Holmes is 3 for 3 in cuts made this year and is coming off back to back T6 finishes at the Farmers and WMPO.
21	21	5	6	negative	At a salary of $7900 Danny Lee is definitely worth consideration this week at Pebble. In his 6 starts this season he has made all 6 cuts, finished in 4th at last weeks Waste Management Open, is currently ranked 31st in driving accuracy and 18th in hitting greens 75-100 yards in.
22	22	11	12	positive	With all of the big names in the field this week, Patrick Reed doesn't seem to be garnering a lot of attention in fantasy circles. He has 3 straight top 30 finishes at the AT&amp;T Pro-Am and 2 top 15 finishes in the past 3 years.
23	23	0	1	positive	William McGirt is a name that should on DFS radars this week. He has 4 top 25 finishes in 6 starts this season and is T19 in birdie average and at $7,400 his price is right.
24	24	0	0	negative	Matt Every $6,600 has withdrawn from the tournament. Get him out of your lineups.
25	25	7	7	positive	I'm guessing the large price tag on Snedeker this week is the reason for a lack of chatter on FanShare. That being said, again if you're running with a favourite and lower value picks he has to be worth consideration. Over 40% of winners at Pebble Beach are repeat champions, and Snedeker is coming into defend his title on about as hot as a streak as you can have.
26	26	31	31	positive	That being said, again if you're running with a favourite and lower value picks he has to be worth consideration. Over 40% of winners at Pebble Beach are repeat champions, and Snedeker is coming into defend his title on about as hot as a streak as you can have. Prior to a respectable 33rd place finish last week he had finished with two 1st, one 2nd, and one 3rd..
27	27	1	2	negative	Fades  Vaughn Taylor … Congrats if you were among the 0.09 percent on board in PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf driven by AVIS for his stunning win at Pebble Beach, but we shouldn’t hope for more than a cut made at Riviera where he’s done just that in his last four trips. I rarely caution gamers using emotion as an excuse, but the soon-to-be 40-year-old (his birthday is March 9) was in obviously disbelief following his victory. He earned the right to bask in the achievement, but it’s back to business in a measurably deeper field this week.
28	28	23	24	negative	He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
29	29	14	15	negative	Arrived last year in the best form of his career and connected over-par scores. Kevin Chappell … So much for the groove in which he capped 2015 with a runner-up finish at Sea Island. It was repeated in this space at how the Nappy Factor was in play since May.

32	32	0	0	positive	"Hadwin in particular could be a real deep sleeper pick this week. He has made 6 of 8 cuts this season and has T6 (CareerBuilder Challenge) and T17 (WMO) finishes. He also ranks 3rd on tour in ""strokes gained from putting"" and T6 in ""3 putt avoidance""."
33	33	0	0	positive	Mickelson sits 5th on tour this season in birdie average at 4.93 and is averaging 100.5 fantasy points over his last two outings. Lefty is making his third straight start at the Honda Classic and will be looking to improve on last year's T17 finish. He should be full of confidence after a nice start to the season but at $10,800 there are only four golfers more expensive than Mickelson this week.

35	35	71	72	positive	Plus, a lot of players are using this week as a tune-up for next week’s WGC-Cadillac Championship. Regardless of reason, tournament organizers aren’t complaining about the quality of field: Branden Grace and wunderkind Matthew Fitzpatrick are making their 2016 US debuts, joining fellow high-ranking internationals Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Russell Knox, Shane Lowry, and Luke Donald, along with Americans Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Zach Johnson, Kevin Kisner, and Jimmy Walker. Honda Classic Key Stats Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green Greens in Regulation Scrambling (Sand) Bogey Avoidance Proximity 175-225 Yards Honda Classic Course PGA NATIONAL | Par: 70 | 7,140 Yards Some will point to the extreme weather that forced a Monday finish as the reason for the course playing so difficult in 2015, but that’s simply not true.
36	36	35	35	positive	He’s flashed the ability to go low on this course last year, following up a horrendous opening round 78 with a Friday 64 to make the cut. Still an elite Par 4 scorer (5th), if Brooks can avoid the one blow-up round, he’ll be in contention. Kevin Kisner: The more people continue to overlook Kisner, the more he’ll end up on my roster.
37	37	22	22	positive	He’s the type of short-hitting player that still manages to gain strokes tee-to-green that you want to target this week. C-List Daniel Berger: Berger, the reigning PGA Rookie of the Year, gets a home game this week: He’s from the area and played college golf at FSU. While he’s struggled so far in 2016 (T42/MC/T58/MC), a return to bermudagrass should help him get his game back together and, hopefully, avenge his playoff loss on this site last season.
38	38	13	13	positive	A couple of additional factors potentially adding to Knox's appeal this week: 1) Knox ranks 1st on tour in GIR % at 77.57% and 2) he hails from Inverness, in the north of Scotland, and therefore should be used to playing in windy conditions, which may give him an edge at PGA National Resort &amp; Spa.
39	39	19	20	positive	Despite missing the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open and only finishing T39 at last week's Northern Trust Open, Paul Casey is a name that will likely find his way into quite a few line ups this week. Casey ranks 5th on tour in GIR %, 6th in total driving, and 2nd in ball striking. Casey also finished T3 at last year's Honda Classic.

44	44	0	1	positive	Kevin Kisner has not played since the Waste Management Open at TPC Scottsdale 3 weeks ago where he missed the cut, but does that make him a forgotten man for daily fantasy purposes? It shouldn't, prior to missing the cut at the WMO, Kisner had made 4 straight top 10's which included a 1st, 2nd, and T5. Also, one look at Kisner's statistical rankings on www.pgatour.com and one quickly realizes how great of a season he is having.

50	50	24	24	positive	In a no cut event, taking a chance on an upside player that will be owned by a minority of Fantasy players is key. JT is coming off a T3 at the Honda and has Top 30 grades in driving distance, birdie average, eagle average, approaches from beyond 200 yards, Par 5 birdies or better, and strokes gained: Tee-to-Green.

Brooks Koepka – A Florida guy, Brooks will eventually avoid those pesky crooked numbers that destroy his round. When you’re exclusively targeting bombers it’s impossible to leave Koepka off your squad, so here he is.
55	55	0	1	positive	Brooks Koepka – A Florida guy, Brooks will eventually avoid those pesky crooked numbers that destroy his round. When you’re exclusively targeting bombers it’s impossible to leave Koepka off your squad, so here he is. His 307.8 yards off the tee is good for 10th best on TOUR.
56	56	14	14	positive	His 307.8 yards off the tee is good for 10th best on TOUR. JB Holmes – Sitting lofty in distance numbers (3rd) and SG: T2G (11th), Holmes has reeled off four straight T11 finishes (or better) entering play. JB finished runner-up on this site last year too.
57	57	9	10	positive	JB finished runner-up on this site last year too. Henrik Stenson – The Cadillac marks Stenson’s first US appearance this year, hopefully, keeping him off the collective’s radar. The Swede hasn’t finished worse than T16 at this event the past two seasons, and enters hotter than usual for this time of year, with a T6 and T3 in loaded fields during the Middle East, Euro Tour swing already in 2016.

Justin Rose – With most Fantasy players likely gravitating towards Rory McIlroy, justifiably, I like Rose in his spot instead. We’re plenty familiar with Rose’s long-iron acumen, but it’s his new found power off the tee that puts him in play this week.
59	59	22	23	positive	"Early expert analysis has identified two key stat categories for this week: driving distance and par 5 scoring.

In his 9 starts Thomas has made 7 cuts (4 top 25, 3 top 10's and 2 3rd place finishes.)
64	64	9	9	positive	Ok he may be expensive BUT hard to ignore Scott coming into Doral after his win last week. Scott comes in with some solid stats ranked 8th in driving distance, 4th in par 5 eagles, 2nd in par 5 birdies or better. In his 5 starts this year he has a win along with 2 2nd place finishes!
65	65	5	6	positive	For similar money I'm taking Adam Scott over DJ with Scott's form coming in and his ability to finish
66	66	33	34	positive	Johnson is coming off a fourth-place finish in his last start at the Northern Trust Open. Matt Barrie -- Brooks Koepka ($9,200)  There isn't a player more in synch with his game than Adam Scott. He's certainly the favorite at Doral.
67	67	38	39	positive	Not only has Johnson had great success in the past at this event (only one finish outside top 12 since 2011), he's coming in rested and unscathed since he didn't play the Honda last week. Jeff Bergerson -- Henrik Stenson ($10,300)  In analyzing previous tournament data for this week's event, we see that driving distance and par-5 scoring are key statistics. Stenson is very strong in both.

69	69	58	58	positive	In addition, he ranked second in strokes gained tee-to-green last year on the PGA Tour. This will be Stenson's first appearance on U.S soil this year, which I believe will lead to him being overlooked, especially considering his price on DraftKings puts him right between crowd favorites Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler. In his last three worldwide events, Stenson has a T-6 at Omega Dubai Desert Classic, T-3 at Abu Dhabi HSBC, and second-place finish at the Nedbank Golf Challenge.

Holmes ($9,400)  Last year, J.B. Holmes should have been able to cruise to a win on Sunday afternoon at Doral. After firing a 62 in the first round to go to -10 (-9 was the winning score), Holmes entered the final day with a five-shot lead, only to shoot a 75 and lose by a stroke to Dustin Johnson.

74	74	26	26	positive	He is a player that can score on the par 5 holes and makes plenty of birdies along the way. As if that was not enough, Holmes has finished in the top-11 in five of six starts this season and is looking more consistent than ever before.

His course history at Doral hasn't been amazing, T31 in 2015 and T16 in 2014 but he will be full of confidence coming off of his 2nd place finish last week at the Honda Classic.

(GPP and cash)  Justin Rose ($10,100):  Rose has had a fairly good season so far with four Top 16 finishes in his last five events. His stats so far this year line up nicely with the course.
81	81	4	4	positive	Possible sleeper this week? Schwartzel has 5 top 25 finishes in his 6 starts at Doral with 3 of these being top 10 finishes (2010=2nd, 2012 = 4, 2014=9th). He is coming into this week ranked 4th on the European Tour and has made all 3 cuts in PGA events he has played in, finishing with a tie for 6th at the Frys.
82	82	11	12	positive	Aside from a missed cut at the Sony Open in January, Graeme McDowell has been making some decent finishes of late. He has 4 top 10's in his last 7 PGA Tour events, and has finished no worse than 29th in 6 of 7. McDowell also ranks 3rd on tour in Bogey Avoidance, which has proven to be an important stat category in the past at the Valspar Championship.
83	83	0	0	positive	McDowell also ranks 3rd on tour in Bogey Avoidance, which has proven to be an important stat category in the past at the Valspar Championship. He has 4 top 10's in his last 7 PGA Tour events, and has finished no worse than 29th in 6 of 7. Aside from a missed cut at the Sony Open in January, Graeme McDowell has been making some decent finishes of late.
84	84	9	10	positive	With only 67 bogeys in 630 holes of golf, Russell Knox leads the PGA Tour in Bogey Avoidance. Knox's overall game hasn't been great recently though as he has failed to place higher than T26 in any of his last 5 events, including two missed cuts.
85	85	0	0	positive	McDowell ranks 4th on tour in driving accuracy, and 2nd putting inside 10 ft. (91.88%). Also Copperhead will reward putting, ranked as 9th toughest inside 10 feet. Copperhead should reward those player's who can be deadly accurate off the tee...the ability to put the ball where you want will come in handy..sometimes rough cut is better than fairway.
86	86	7	8	positive	I am expecting higher ownership %'s on Danny Willett this week after his T3 performance at the WGC last week. I don't see this as a reason to back off Willett though. He has 7 Top 20 finishes in his last 10 worldwide events including 5 Top 5's.
87	87	0	0	positive	Willett is now the 11th ranked golfer in the world according to the OWGR. He has 7 Top 20 finishes in his last 10 worldwide events including 5 Top 5's. I don't see this as a reason to back off Willett though.
88	88	15	15	positive	Have to admit, I am struggling to find any statistical category to back up putting Na in my lineup this week other than a T10 last year and a 2nd at Copperhead in 2014! He obviously knows the course well which should favour him.
89	89	0	0	negative	Stenson's first time around Copperhead was last year where he finished 4th. Pat Mayo (@ThePME) thinking approach shots 175-200 yards will be a key stat. Also Copperhead is 9th toughest in putts inside 10 feet.
90	90	3	3	negative	Based on this Stenson is worth definite consideration this week ranked 1st on tour inside 10 feet at 93.24% of putts made and 16th in approach accuracy between 175 and 200 yards out. Also Copperhead is 9th toughest in putts inside 10 feet. Pat Mayo (@ThePME) thinking approach shots 175-200 yards will be a key stat.
91	91	11	12	positive	VALSPAR DK POLL: Favorite Player $7K-$8K Favorite Plater Sub-$7K I’ll go John Huh ($7,700) &amp; Morgan Hoffmann ($6,100)
92	92	24	24	positive	Can't argue that Stenson looks like a strong play this week based on this analysis but at his price ($11,500) I think I like Willett more for $10,800 based on his current form if I'm only putting in one lineup.
93	93	0	1	negative	Webb Simpson ranks 5th on tour in Par 4 Birdie or Better scoring (J. Speith is first) which could be a key stat this week. Simpson missed the cut the last time he played at the Valspar Championship in 2014.

96	96	1	2	negative	Fades  Branden Grace … It won’t surprise anyone when he rises into contention again on the PGA TOUR, but gamers know enough not to reach for it without enough cause. Since concluding a blistering opening on the European Tour with a win in Qatar, the South African missed the cut at PGA National and placed T23 at Doral where he ranked eighth in strokes gained: putting. His Sunday 68 was his first red number in the U.S. since a closing 69 at the Wyndham Championship last August.
97	97	12	13	negative	Missed the cut in his only previous try at Copperhead in 2014. Louis Oosthuizen … Classic trap. His current form is terrific, but Copperhead hasn’t suited his eye.
98	98	10	11	negative	Consider revisiting if he commits to Bay Hill next week. Charley Hoffman … Not since 2012 has he taken as much time to round into form. A T17 at Doral last week was his first top 40 in seven starts in 2015-16.
99	99	24	25	negative	Five of his six cuts made at Copperhead have occurred in his last six starts, but he missed last year’s cut at 13-over 155. Martin Kaymer … Entirely more valuable in reality than fantasy. Has yet to exhibit any consistency despite massive wins in 2014.
100	100	7	8	negative	Barely worth owning in deep full-season formats. Ryan Palmer … This is relative as compared to projected DFS value as he rarely has you sweating to make the cut, but his only top 25 in seven tries at Copperhead is a T25, and that was 10 years ago. Francesco Molinari … Like Palmer, the Italian will likely have a tee time in the third round, but he’s tailed off since concluding 2015 with a T4 at the DP World Tour Championship.
101	101	0	1	negative	Ryan Palmer … This is relative as compared to projected DFS value as he rarely has you sweating to make the cut, but his only top 25 in seven tries at Copperhead is a T25, and that was 10 years ago. Francesco Molinari … Like Palmer, the Italian will likely have a tee time in the third round, but he’s tailed off since concluding 2015 with a T4 at the DP World Tour Championship. Only one top 50 among four cuts made in five starts to open his PGA TOUR Season.
102	102	17	18	negative	Only one top 50 among four cuts made in five starts to open his PGA TOUR Season. Daniel Berger … The 2015 Rookie of the Year has yet to quiet murmurs of a sophomore slump, but he was a tailspin until a late adjustment yielded a fruitful Playoffs last season. That’s golf, most would say, but he missed the cut at PGA National two weeks ago after losing in a playoff there last year.
103	103	10	11	negative	He then missed the cut at Copperhead two weeks later. Chris Kirk … Second appearance (MC, 2011). Only top 25 among two cuts made in five starts in 2016 is a T24 at the 32-man Hyundai Tournament of Champions, so there’s residual concern over the recovery of a broken hand.
104	104	16	17	negative	None of this is good news, but he’s an early candidate for salary gamers in 2016-17. Ian Poulter … Tied for 24th here last year, but was flashing better form at the time. His only top 25 on U.S. soil in the last nine months is a T17 at Firestone last August.
105	105	14	15	negative	This dynamic makes him impossible to own in any format for the time being. Graham DeLaet … Top 20s in his last two trips (2013, 2014), but he’s been scuffling since opening 2016 with a share of seventh place at Waialae. In fact, that remains the only top 30 in his last 13 starts.
106	106	8	9	negative	Usually finds a rhythm deeper into seasons, though. Keegan Bradley … First appearance since missing the cut in his debut five years ago. Plummeting in the Official World Golf Ranking where he’s 88th, which is actually up a spot from the previous week, but this is the worst he’s been positioned since he was 108th before winning the 2011 PGA Championship.
107	107	20	21	negative	Since a T14 in Abu Dhabi in January, he’s 1-for-3 on the PGA TOUR with a T43 at PGA National. Hunter Mahan … Unfortunately, nothing has changed as it concerns his expectation every time out. The 33-year-old has been a fixture in his section as he grinds through a slump.
108	108	7	8	negative	Hasn’t appeared at Copperhead since 2008 (T23). Boo Weekley … Just not enough evidence from any direction to warrant confidence. He’s 1-for-5 in 2016 with a solo fifth at TPC Scottsdale.
109	109	12	13	negative	The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
110	110	45	46	positive	On this week's Fantasy Golf Insider podcast the hosts were comparing the course style/design at the Valspar Championship to the RBC Heritage event. The only two players to finish in the Top 10 in both the Valspar and the RBC last year: Sean O'Hair and Troy Merritt.
111	111	10	10	positive	Mid range sleeper picks mentioned in Garosi's analysis include: Kang, Reavie, and Barber.
112	112	0	0	positive	Matt Every may be the most owned he has ever been for this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. Every is the two time (back-to-back) defending champion at the event.
113	113	1	2	positive	Expect Henrik Stenson to be highly owned once again this week. He has 4 straight top 20 finishes at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, including 2 straight top 5's and 3 straight top 10's.
114	114	40	41	positive	"Having said that I do suspect many will be having the ""he can't possibly win three straight"" conversation in his head which may result in his ownership being lower than it should be. We saw some of this thinking with Adam Scott heading into the Cadillac WGC coming off his win at the Honda."
115	115	0	0	positive	Kuchar continues to be a cut making machine. He made his 18th consecutive cut on his way to a T11 finish at the Valspar Championship last week. Kuchar has never played in the API before this week but based purely on his ability to make cuts, he should always be in the discussion for cash game lineups.

121	121	37	38	positive	He’s been all or nothing at the Arnold Palmer Invitational (MC/2nd/15th/3rd/MC), but enters in good form (17th/16th/6th) and Top 15 grades in 200+ yard birdies or better, SG: T2G, birdie average, and overall birdie or better rate. Camilo Villegas – Since I’m eating chalk for most my picks, I’ll swerve on the C-List. I can assure you, few will have Villegas on their roster.
122	122	0	1	positive	Camilo Villegas – Since I’m eating chalk for most my picks, I’ll swerve on the C-List. I can assure you, few will have Villegas on their roster. Camilo has finished no worse than 21st the last three years, and enters with three straight cuts made.

Kelly also has a Top-10 finish at another island course (Hawaii) this season, in which he played bogey-free golf for his first 21 holes, carding seven birdies and an eagle to stay in contention most of the tournament.

He’s a player to be in contention this week in Puerto Rico.
150	150	30	31	positive	Look for Donald to make a statement in this event that he’s ready, willing, and able to start to reclaim his place in the sun. One from the Rough (Sleeper)  Hiroshi Iwata  He was in contention a few months ago at Pebble and almost captured his first PGA Tour win. After his big performance, Iwata registered back-to-back missed cuts, but his play is one that could be a great fit this week in Puerto Rico.

154	154	0	1	positive	Patton Kizzire 100/1. Hasn't missed a cut since the Sony. Made it out of the group stage at the Match Play.

156	156	8	9	positive	If there was ever a week to roster Mark Hubbard this might be it. He's made 13 of his last 15 cuts, was T15 last week at the PR Open, and is only $5,400 on Draft Kings.
157	157	5	6	positive	The Shell Houston Open is Phil Mickelson’s final start before the Masters. Lefty should be feeling good about a return to the Golf Club of Houston. The Shell Houston Open is the last stop before the PGA TOUR heads to Augusta National.
158	158	42	43	positive	For fantasy managers, this week is as much about some of the world’s best players making their final preparations for the Masters as it is about the competition for the Shell Houston Open title. Several of the favorites for Augusta National, including Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler, will be working tirelessly to get their swings primed for the first major of the year. As a rule, fantasy managers should always strive to be observant and attentive to detail, but that’s especially true this week.

What specifically about this course helps your preparation for playing Augusta National?
161	161	17	18	positive	What is it about this golf course that you like that gets you ready for next week? PHIL MICKELSON: I actually think that it’s more just about getting in a competitive frame of mind. I like the way the course is set up.
162	162	4	5	positive	The style of play? PHIL MICKELSON: The style of play here is totally different than Augusta. The rope is at 300 yards or so off the tee, everything pitches in here and every tee shot has a hazard in play.
163	163	10	11	positive	What was working for you the best out there today? MATT KUCHAR: Hard to say. Just steady round of golf.
164	164	14	15	positive	What do you like about this golf course and how it suits your game? J.B. HOLMES: You know, it’s a good preview for the Masters. They don’t have as much rough around here.
165	165	10	11	negative	Can you elaborate on why it fits you so well? KEEGAN BRADLEY: It’s a big golf course. All the par-5s are reachable for the most part for the longer players.
166	166	7	8	positive	What do you like about this course? J.B. HOLMES: You know, it’s always well manicured. It’s not a whole lot of rough.
167	167	10	11	positive	Would you say the course favors long hitters like yourself? J.B. HOLMES: I think this course in general can favor long hitters. It’s pretty long out there, it gets windy, and some of those holes could be difficult.
168	168	2	3	positive	Most Comfortable: J.B. Holmes  With due respect to Vijay Singh and Stuart Appleby, who ranked a respective 1-2 in all-time earnings in the tournament, the defending champ owns this place. Singh won thrice, including in the last editions at both TPC Woodlands (2002) and the GC of Houston’s Member Course (2005), but he’s 1-for-3 on the current track and hasn’t shown since 2010. Appleby took home the first trophy here in 2006 and shared runner-up honors in his title defense, but it was his last top 20.
169	169	9	9	positive	He’s missed the cut in his last four trips. Holmes survived a three-way playoff last year with Jordan Spieth and Johnson Wagner. Going out in the 12th-to-last pairing in the finale, Holmes came from six strokes back after 54 holes with an 8-under 64.
170	170	0	0	positive	Holmes survived a three-way playoff last year with Jordan Spieth and Johnson Wagner. Going out in the 12th-to-last pairing in the finale, Holmes came from six strokes back after 54 holes with an 8-under 64. He birdied his first five holes and seven of his first eight en route to an outward 29.
171	171	55	55	positive	So, [I] really didn’t look at the scoreboard all day, try to do the best I could on each hole and knew I had to have a few birdies because I thought it was going to take a low number to have a chance.”  No one else broke 66 that day. For the round, Holmes converted 127 feet, 8 inches worth of putts including four from outside 13 feet. He hit 16 greens in regulation and needed only 26 putts.
172	172	39	39	positive	However, he ended the week ranked last in fairways hit, a dubious honor first achieved by a champion in 2010 when Anthony Kim emerged from a playoff with Vaughn Taylor. After his opening round en route to his title, Holmes explained why you can hit it almost anywhere at the GC of Houston and it won’t cost you. “You know, it’s a good preview for the Masters,” he said.
173	173	2	3	positive	Have heard Chez Reavie's name come up on a couple of podcasts this week. He's made 4 straight cuts and is 26th in SGT2G.
174	174	0	0	positive	"Oosthuizen has been playing great golf and is garnering a lot of expert mentions this week but I have heard more than one ""expert"" mention the risk of withdrawal from the event due to injury. This may keep Louis' ownership down slightly this week."
175	175	28	28	positive	Then you can think about all the occasions when first-timers finished right outside the winner’s circle. You don’t have to go back far; just two years ago both Spieth and Blixt finished T2 here their first time around. Augusta National is definitely a track with a steep learning curve, and most golfers should be downgraded in their debut, but we can’t treat all first-timers the same.
176	176	23	23	positive	Now he’s almost coming in under the radar after some golfers stole some spotlight at the Match Play event as well as Houston. Scott has gained the most strokes over the field over the last 10 weeks of PGA TOUR action and he’s gained the second most strokes at Augusta National since 2010. Getting Stevie back on the bag this week sounds really weird at first considering how well he’s playing.
177	177	22	22	positive	Thinking about it further though, and Stevie’s knowledge of Augusta could prove crucial by week’s end. Phil Mickelson… Lefty is right behind Scott in both metrics I listed (Strokes Gained over Last 10 Weeks and Course History since 2010). He’s almost as good as it gets this week as a course horse in great form.
178	178	14	15	positive	There’s no way he can find as many water balls as last week, right? Jordan Spieth… Speaking of water balls, The Texas Longhorn has eight last week in route to a top 15 at the Shell Houston Open. A case of “what could have been” I suppose.
179	179	26	26	positive	His form is un-Spiethlike but his course history at Augusta National speaks for itself. Rory McIlroy… I’m able to forgive poor form in the case of Spieth but Rory is out of form and his course history is subpar, by his standards. His last two trips are trending in the right direction, so that’s a plus.
180	180	17	18	positive	If I were making just 10 Milly Maker lineups, I think I would own just one Rory. Justin Rose… In 10 trips to ANGC, his worst finish is a T39. He’s a machine who grinds his way to field average even when he doesn’t have his best stuff.
181	181	17	18	positive	I like his mental fortitude this week, and could easily see him on the podium come Sunday. Rickie Fowler… Fowler is in that danger zone of major championship experience. If he doesn’t win one soon, he’ll get that label as someone who can’t finish the big one.
182	182	18	19	positive	Over his last 14 rounds of stroke-play, he’s gained 26.730 strokes over the field. In that same stretch, Adam Scott has gained 51.850 strokes in 16 rounds, for comparisons sake. That’s more than 25 fewer strokes gained, yet the media seems to already be crowning Day and getting the green jacket fitted to his measurements.
183	183	17	18	positive	Should be a staple of cash games on DraftKings this week at the measly price of $7,800. Justin Thomas… He’s making his debut but he did get a trial run with the Masters legend himself, Jeff Knox. It’s hard to trust his first week at Augusta but his ability to rack of birdies and eagles makes him a great DFS sleeper.
184	184	9	10	positive	My Top 25 for the 2016 Masters  1. Adam Scott  2. Justin Rose  3.
185	185	4	5	positive	Adam Scott  2. Justin Rose  3. Jordan Spieth  4.
186	186	4	5	positive	Justin Rose  3. Jordan Spieth  4. Bubba Watson  5.
187	187	4	5	positive	Jordan Spieth  4. Bubba Watson  5. Rickie Fowler  6.
188	188	4	5	positive	Bubba Watson  5. Rickie Fowler  6. Jason Day  7.
189	189	24	25	positive	He grades out well again this week and I think another top 30 is in the cards, maybe not much more than that, though. Patrick Reed… Is playing incredible despite not putting up to his standards. Claimed to have found something with his putting stroke on Sunday at the Golf Club of Houston.
190	190	4	5	positive	Matt Kuchar  10. Brooks Koepka  11. Patrick Reed  12.
191	191	4	5	positive	Brooks Koepka  11. Patrick Reed  12. Dustin Johnson  13.
192	192	0	0	positive	Oosthuizen has only made the cut 50% of the time since he started playing The Masters in 2008.
193	193	22	23	positive	He hasn't peaked yet this year, but like the azaleas in Augusta this Rose could, um, bloom this week. Bob Harig -- Louis Oosthuizen ($8,800)  He's coming off a missed cut in Houston, but that might be a good thing for Oosthuizen, who has played a lot of good golf lately, going back to a win in February in Australia. The 2012 runner-up also was second in two majors in 2015, and yet comes in a bit under the radar.
194	194	17	18	positive	He’s a good punt option this week if you’re looking for a made cut with some upside. Bernd Wiesberger ($6,500) – Wiesberger is by far my favorite play in this price range, and hopefully his lack of name brand keeps ownership down. In his first Masters last year, he finished 22nd, and he’s popped up in majors before.
195	195	19	19	positive	Although his key stats don’t pop out this week, he is 42nd in SG:T2G and has decent Driving Distance. Wiesberger is held back by his putter most weeks, so hopefully he can find the touch he had last year around Augusta National. My motto this week: #FeelTheBernd.
196	196	37	37	positive	In two appearances at The Masters Hoffman has a top 30 and a 9th place finish, and with top 10 upside at under $7k, Hoffman will be a strong value consideration for me. Golfers I Hate  Adam Scott ($11,900) – Scott is going to be a tough fade for me because he clearly has some serious upside at Augusta, but I can’t roster every golfer and at some point we’re all forced to make a choice. That being said it’s likely my strategy this week will be to include at least some ownership of all the higher priced golfers because they all have the potential to win at Augusta, so he will still make his way into a small percentage of my lineups.
197	197	8	9	positive	Every member of the PGATOUR.COM expert panel has Adam Scott in their lineup for this week! Pretty decent overall consensus..
198	198	7	7	positive	Rory going off in final pairing with Haas. Help or hinder with the wind blowing late in the day!
199	199	0	0	negative	Spieth cracked the face of his driver today. Forced to use new one tomorrow.
200	200	1	2	positive	1. Bill Haas ($7,500) – Has a 2nd and a 9th in his last couple of starts, and has 6 top 18th’s this season. His Masters record is sparkling with 3 top 20’s in the past three years, including his best Masters finish to date which was a 12th last year.
201	201	1	2	positive	9. Daniel Berger ($6,200) – Seems to be over his cold spell, and in his last start he put together a solid week to earn a 5th place finish at the Houston Open. He’s a rookie at The Masters so the cut line may prove elusive to him, but on paper he looks like a decent bet at $6.2K.
202	202	49	50	positive	Has a 17th, an 18th, and a 19th in his past three starts, and in his only Masters appearance he had a 54th in 2013. My main lineup in DraftKings this week as of right now, with $100 in the budget to spare: Bubba Watson ($11,400), Rickie Fowler ($10,900), Bill Haas ($7,500), Kevin Na ($6,900), Ryan Moore ($6,800), and Charley Hoffman ($6,400).

203	203	0	0	positive	Kisner finished 2nd at last year's Heritage after losing in a playoff to Jim Furyk. He's a South Carolina native and should be feeling comfortable at Hilton Head.
204	204	32	32	negative	Defending champ Jim Furyk is not playing this year and I am sure RBC would love to see a few more of their guys in the mix on Sunday. Hadwin, Els, DeLaet, Weir, and Hearn all missed the cut last year.
205	205	0	0	positive	Berger could be a nice option this week coming off his T10 finish at the Masters. He was T72 last year at the Heritage.
206	206	17	17	positive	Help or hindrance coming off the Masters last week? If it's a help you have to like Casey after T4 finish and possibly riding some confidence?
207	207	0	0	positive	Bohn also 6th in driving accuracy. He has all the attributes to place well this weekend if he can put it together
208	208	2	3	positive	(GPP only). Paul Casey ($10,800):  Casey played well last week at the Masters with a 4th place finish and has three consecutive Top 10s on Tour. His stats for the course are good and he hasn’t finished outside of the Top 22 in three starts at Harbour Town.
209	209	37	37	positive	His stats for the course are good and he hasn’t finished outside of the Top 22 in three starts at Harbour Town. With how strong his game has been the last year, I think a win for Casey is inevitable this year and it could come at this event with a weaker field. (GPP and cash)  Brandt Snedeker ($10,600):  Snedeker has been having a solid 2016 missing only one cut in eight events with four Top 10s.
210	210	19	20	positive	HTGL hosted the 1989 Tour Championship. The Field  Favorites  in order of preference for this week and this tournament  Paul Casey: He’s found the top 10 in his last three stroke play events as he’s 10th in ball-striking and 20th in GIR. Played his last 27 at Augusta in bogey-free six-under par to finish T-4.
211	211	13	14	positive	He’s MC in three of the last five with nothing better than T-29. Bill Haas: This will be his 12th start on the trot at HTGL and more than half his starts, six, have seen him MC. Nothing better than T-24, so I’m not running out to jam him into any lineups.
212	212	2	3	positive	Most Comfortable: Luke Donald  It’s been 11 years now since five-time RBC Heritage champion Davis Love III crashed the top 20 in the tournament. So, it is with due respect that the Englishman gets the current nod despite struggling since scaling to the top of seemingly everything in 2011. Donald ranks third on the all-time money list at Harbour Town with $2.544 million in the absence of a victory.
213	213	25	25	positive	So, it is with due respect that the Englishman gets the current nod despite struggling since scaling to the top of seemingly everything in 2011. Donald ranks third on the all-time money list at Harbour Town with $2.544 million in the absence of a victory. He has a trio of second-place finishes, including that as a victim in Furyk’s first playoff win in, when else, 2011 when Donald paced both the PGA TOUR and European Tour in earnings.
214	214	0	0	positive	Donald ranks third on the all-time money list at Harbour Town with $2.544 million in the absence of a victory. He has a trio of second-place finishes, including that as a victim in Furyk’s first playoff win in, when else, 2011 when Donald paced both the PGA TOUR and European Tour in earnings. He also ascended to the top of the OWGR in May of that year.
215	215	20	20	positive	With all arrows converging and pointed straight up, he was the prohibitive favorite to prevail. “It’s a classic golf course,” Donald said in his pre-tournament presser. “It’s one you have to really manage your game around.
216	216	42	42	positive	I love the fact that it’s a positional golf course, rather than one that demands length.”  As golf goes, he’d settle for a share of 37th place despite finishing T25 in greens in regulation and second in scrambling for the week. Donald’s shortcoming occurred in scoring as he ranked third-from-last in converting on his chances to break par, converting only nine of 42 chances. By comparison, champion Carl Pettersson went 22-for-50 on his looks en route to a five-shot win.
217	217	23	23	positive	By comparison, champion Carl Pettersson went 22-for-50 on his looks en route to a five-shot win. After rebounding with a T3 in 2013, Donald would sit on a two-stroke lead after 54 holes in 2014 before Matt Kuchar clipped him by one in the finale with a 64 to Donald’s 69. Yet, the Brit’s comfort level at Harbour Town wasn’t wavering.
218	218	23	23	positive	If you miss greens, you need to be pretty good at the short game. Certainly a course that favors my style of play.”  Donald returned to coach Pat Goss later that same year, and then added a T15 to his slate here in 2015. He hasn’t had a top 10 on U.S. soil in 9½ months, he hasn’t had a top 10 anywhere since October, and he’s still chasing his first top 20 of 2016, but like an old friend, Harbour Town will be waiting so the pair can pick up where they left off.
219	219	10	11	positive	Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jeff Bergerson -- Bill Haas ($9,100)  Editor's Picks Analyzing RBC Heritage DFS salaries Zach Turcotte of FantasyGolfInsider.com takes a look at the shifts in DraftKings PGA salaries ahead of this week at the RBC Heritage. A very strong corollary course to Harbour Town is Copperhead, where the Valspar is played.
220	220	18	18	positive	A very strong corollary course to Harbour Town is Copperhead, where the Valspar is played. If you remember, Haas had his best finish in a long time there a few weeks ago, finishing runner-up to Charl Schwartzel. Haas is a South Carolina guy who has had decent success at the RBC in the past.
221	221	3	3	positive	If you remember, Haas had his best finish in a long time there a few weeks ago, finishing runner-up to Charl Schwartzel. Haas is a South Carolina guy who has had decent success at the RBC in the past. Harbour Town is a short course, with narrow fairways and small greens.
222	222	28	28	positive	Harbour Town is a short course, with narrow fairways and small greens. For this reason we want accuracy off the tee and a good approach game -- and Haas ranks well in both of those (31st in driving accuracy and 39th in GIR). I am expecting Haas to provide a lot of value for his pricetag this week on Draftkings.
223	223	16	16	positive	For this reason we want accuracy off the tee and a good approach game -- and Haas ranks well in both of those (31st in driving accuracy and 39th in GIR). I am expecting Haas to provide a lot of value for his pricetag this week on Draftkings. Roger Casey -- Matthew Fitzpatrick ($9,500)  It's rare that we see a week-to-week salary jump quite as big as that of Matthew Fitzpatrick's ($6,800 to $9,500), but it seems well-warranted after his outstanding performance at Augusta last week.
224	224	9	10	positive	I'm a buyer in all formats. Zachary Turcotte -- Jerry Kelly ($6,800)  A lot of times when building rosters for the week, it is easier to find a name in the middle or bottom tier to start with, rather than going at it the other way around. This is particularly true in fields that are a little weaker than normal, where the top level players do not look like overwhelming favorites.
225	225	25	26	positive	With that in mind, it is important to anchor your teams around a few veterans with course experience who are also playing well this season. Jerry Kelly is a very affordable example this week, having made the cut at Hilton Head in six straight years and nine of the last eleven. He has also been having a solid season in making eight-of-nine cuts with a couple of decent finishes.
226	226	28	29	positive	His price is $2,500 less than Day's, which allows me to afford another top level player to lead my line this week along with Johnson. Michael Collins -- Luke Donald ($8,300)  Since 2009, Donald has five finishes of 2nd (2009 and 2014) or 3rd place (2010, 2011 and 2013) at the RBC Heritage, and made the cut easily in the other two appearances (37th in 2012 and 15th in 2015). This tournament fits everything about his game -- it's played on a short course that also demands a great short game.
227	227	0	0	negative	Mickelson has yet to crack the top 25 in his career here..that in combination with his Masters showing he's a sit consideration at this price point.
228	228	2	3	positive	At $8400 C. Hoffman warrants strong consideration. He has 9 top 15 finishes here in his last 10 starts and was amongst the leaders last week at The Heritage after day 2 and 3 before finishing in a T14
229	229	0	0	positive	Knost will return to the Valero this year after withdrawing from the event last year. With long narrow fairway driving accuracy will be important. Knost is ranked 2nd on tour in this category, has made 13 of 14 cuts so far this year and had a decent T14 result last week at The Heritage.
230	230	9	9	positive	With long narrow fairway driving accuracy will be important. Knost is ranked 2nd on tour in this category, has made 13 of 14 cuts so far this year and had a decent T14 result last week at The Heritage. At $7000 he could be worth consideration
231	231	34	35	positive	and a pair of giant forward leaping cartoon cows. For Valero, most of the notables from The Heritage are doubling down on post-Masters appearances – champ Branden Grace, Matt Kuchar, Zach Johnson, Brandt Snedeker, Charley Hoffman, Ryan Palmer, and Luke Donald. Plus, Top 25 players Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jimmy Walker, JB Holmes, and Brooks Koepka will be in San Antonio, boosting the credibility of the field.
232	232	20	21	positive	Kirk has a history of winning after a few consistent weeks of quality form, we’re about at that point now. Charley Hoffman – It’s scary how often Hoffman has been in contention in 2016 with no high finishes. Despite going off in the final group Saturday and Sunday multiple times this year, Hoffman hasn’t collected a T10 finish since the Deutsche Bank Championship last September.
233	233	0	1	positive	Charley Hoffman – It’s scary how often Hoffman has been in contention in 2016 with no high finishes. Despite going off in the final group Saturday and Sunday multiple times this year, Hoffman hasn’t collected a T10 finish since the Deutsche Bank Championship last September. Basically, if PGA events were only 36-holes, Hoffman would be Tiger Woods.
234	234	14	14	positive	Despite going off in the final group Saturday and Sunday multiple times this year, Hoffman hasn’t collected a T10 finish since the Deutsche Bank Championship last September. Basically, if PGA events were only 36-holes, Hoffman would be Tiger Woods. I have worries about Valero being Hoff’s fifth straight week of golf, but his current form and history at TPC San Antonio are too enticing to pass up.
235	235	32	32	positive	I have worries about Valero being Hoff’s fifth straight week of golf, but his current form and history at TPC San Antonio are too enticing to pass up. Dating back to January, Hoffman has made eight straight cuts and has never produced a result WOSRE than T11 at this event since it moved to the Oaks course win 2010. Jimmy Walker – Last year’s champ, and the proto-skill set of this course.

Coming off of 4 straight top-25s at this event and a few top-10s in the past few weeks, Kuchar is going to be a popular player this week–but for good reason.

Coming off of 4 straight top-25s at this event and a few top-10s in the past few weeks, Kuchar is going to be a popular player this week–but for good reason. He had it going in Hilton Head as he looked to repeat at the RBC.
241	241	17	17	positive	He had it going in Hilton Head as he looked to repeat at the RBC. I’d go Kuchar this week. 2014 @RBC_Heritage champ Matt Kuchar (-4) with a chance to get back in the winner's circle this weekend.

Despite facing adversity at Augusta, an event where he absolutely came in under the radar, Horschel finished with a very respectable 17th place finish.
245	245	5	5	positive	But this week, I think Horschel is more of a slam dunk. Despite facing adversity at Augusta, an event where he absolutely came in under the radar, Horschel finished with a very respectable 17th place finish. And when talking about his current play, Horschel has made the cut in 9 straight starts.

250	250	13	13	positive	He’s quietly got 4 wins on Tour. A winner in Texas last year, Kirk played for the first time in 4 years at the Valero last year. Having not shown face in a Tour event at the TPC San Antonio, Kirk piled on a top-10 finish in the 2015 playing.

254	254	15	15	positive	The rook is far too calculated to pass up that sort of Extra-2% scheduling opportunity. DeChambeau needs 361 FedEx Cup points to earn temporary member status which gives him unlimited sponsor exemptions for the remainder of the season. If he can breach the Top 125 by this year’s FedEx Cup Playoffs he’ll get his full PGA Tour card for 2017.
255	255	37	38	positive	Plus, his overall scrambling, sand game, greens in regulation are all well above TOUR average, and now that his playing close to his best golf, he’ll likely end up near the top of the field this week. Chris Kirk – Kirk sputtered Sunday at Heritage, but his name keeps popping up on the leaderboard over the weekend. A Bogey/Double Bogey close at Hilton Head dropped him from T4 to T23 last week, but, excluding The Masters, he now has Three T25 in row.
256	256	26	26	positive	A Bogey/Double Bogey close at Hilton Head dropped him from T4 to T23 last week, but, excluding The Masters, he now has Three T25 in row. Kirk has a history of winning after a few consistent weeks of quality form, we’re about at that point now. Charley Hoffman – It’s scary how often Hoffman has been in contention in 2016 with no high finishes.
257	257	29	30	positive	A player of his skill level will only stay out of the winner’s circle so long before breaking through, get on Brooks now before he’s an uber-popular pick again.

258	258	4	5	positive	Bryson Dechambeau – DECHAMWOWWWWWW!!!! Branden Grace – I’ll keep riding the form of Grace, fresh off his first American win. If you’re not the sort who likes taking the winner the week after a victory, Aaron Baddeley hasn’t missed the weekend in San Antonio in his past four starts, notching three T20s, and has covertly posted T10s in two of last three starts overall.

260	260	18	19	positive	How do you prepare for the windy conditions here and is there a specific shot that you practice? MATT KUCHAR: Ball striking is such a key in windy conditions, just solid strikes of the golf ball. If you’re not hitting it solid the wind really takes over.
261	261	15	16	positive	Tied second and what is it about this place, this course, you enjoy so much? DANIEL SUMMERHAYS: If I could play every event at the Valero Texas Open, in TPC San Antonio, I’d have a pretty high World Ranking because it seems to be pretty good to me. -2015  Q.
262	262	11	12	positive	What is it about this place that you think you like? MATT KUCHAR: It’s a demanding driving golf course as well as approaches. I think approaches are really tough.
263	263	58	59	positive	The good news for us golf fans is that the field is of decent quality this week, with the likes of Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed, last week’s champ Branden Grace and others teeing it up in the Lone Star state. Now, let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLA    Billy Horschel– Billy Ho is a cut making machine, with only one unpaid weekend on Tour since The Barclays last August. He’s zigzagged his way between poor appearances here at TPC San Antonio to go along with a pair of third place finishes, including solo third last year.
264	264	11	12	positive	Stay away from PReed this week and thank me later. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK-BOLD-PLAY-OF-THE-WEEK    Daniel Summerhays– Daniel has posted three consecutive t-7th place finishes here—talk about a course horse! He’s actually been fairly consistent overall this season as well (at least for Daniel Summerhays), notching 10/13 cuts made, including last week at Harbour Town where he actually played quite solid, sans a 3rd round 80.

267	267	8	8	positive	Backed Daniel Summerhays at 129/1 in the @valerotxopen. Summerhays has 3 consecutive top tens at the course so has plenty of positive vibes
268	268	3	4	positive	What's wit the Daniel Summerhays magic at The Valero? 15 Top 10s in his career, three of them here in the last three years.
269	269	10	10	positive	Ok so it doesn't look like anyone is talking about Aiken yet..might as well throw my hat in the ring. My rational is that with rain expected all week I'm thinking putting might not be that big of an advantage. The rain may slow the greens enough that players can just take dead aim and stick it close.
270	270	58	59	negative	We were going to add the category of GIR from other than fairway, but we think the whole of scrambling will take this into account. Players that have played well here since 2010 include: Brendan Steele, Adam Scott, Daniel Summerhays, Jim Furyk, Freddie Jacobson, Charley Hoffman, Pat Perez, Cameron Tringale, Jordan Spieth, Aaron Baddeley, Bob Estes, Jason Kokrak, Jimmy Walker and Martin Laird. Before I wrap this up, let’s just conclude the stat categories we’re looking for, in order: GIR from 125 and in, GIR from 175 plus, and the overall scrambling category, as we think people will be off the fairway and into some nasty things, then also missing the green possibly at a higher clip than normal.
271	271	13	14	negative	As always, we love form, history, putting, and this week, Texans! TIER 1  Jimmy Walker – The defending champ. A Texan!
272	272	23	24	positive	This difficult track at TPC San Antonio is 7,435 yards in length, and is a par 72. The defending champ is Texas native, Jimmy Walker, who will be looking to defend his title come Sunday. I have put together my favorite 10 golfers for this week’s tournament for your DraftKings lineup(s), plus added in the salaries for all players too.
273	273	1	2	positive	2. Jimmy Walker ($11,200) – He is the most expensive player to own this week, but for good reason since he won here last year, was 3rd in 2010, 16th in 2014, and 31st in 2013. Has three straight top 30 finishes, including a 6th at the WGC-Cadillac Championship last month.
274	274	1	2	negative	4. J.B. Holmes ($10,100) – Has had a very solid season so far with 4 top 8th’s, and another three more top 24th’s. Has an 11th and a 13th at this tournament, and was 64th last year.
275	275	1	2	positive	9. Aaron Baddeley ($7,400) – It isn’t very often that I have a player on this list that is under $8K but Aaron is too good to resist. He is coming off a 9th at the RBC Heritage last week, and has three top 20’s in the last four years at this tournament, including a 3rd in 2010.
276	276	63	64	positive	Missed the cut in his last start at the Houston Open, but hasn’t missed the cut in back to back starts this season and has a soft landing spot this week in Texas. My main lineup in DraftKings this week as of right now, with $600 in the budget to spare: Charley Hoffman ($9,600), Chris Kirk ($9,000), Daniel Summerhays ($8,300), Freddie Jacobson ($8,100), Aaron Baddeley ($7,400), and Jerry Kelly ($7,000). If you haven’t already, be sure to get an account on DraftFuel to get access to the player analytics you need to build better quality lineups more consistently, win more contests and money on DraftKings and FanDuel, save research time, and improve your research process too.
277	277	10	11	positive	Home game, defending champ, most birdies the last two years. Charley Hoffman ($9,600): Best everything here over the last six years; only thing missing is a win but all six starts T-13 or better. Best everything here over the last six years; only thing missing is a win but all six starts T-13 or better.
278	278	14	15	positive	Hit the top 18 in five of six starts reinforcing the putting angle here. Andrew Loupe ($6,500): Smashes it off the tee and can really putt; T-4 here in 2014. Smashes it off the tee and can really putt; T-4 here in 2014.
279	279	4	5	positive	Patrick Reed  3. Charley Hoffman  4. Brendan Steele  5.
280	280	9	9	positive	Brendan Steele  5. Daniel Summerhays  The choice: Charley Hoffman  Close second: Brendan Steele  Long shot special: Daniel Summerhays  Verdict: Hoffman has been flirting with the top of the leaderboard at Valspar, SHO and last week at RBC Heritage plus his course form is immaculate. I won’t talk you out of Steele (his only win is here and has two other top 10s) or Summerhays (top 10 the last three years) but Hoffman’s form is the easy tiebreaker.

282	282	24	25	positive	Didn’t gain as many as I would have hoped as Sneds, Casey and Kisner didn’t fire. This Week  Fearsome foursome  Jimmy Walker  Patrick Reed  Charley Hoffman  Bryson DeChambeau  Bench mob  Ryan Palmer  Brendan Steele  Counter-programming  Branden Grace  Daniel Summerhays  Matt Kuchar  Brooks Koepka  Chris Kirk  Troy Merritt  Yahoo! Fantasy Golf  This is a limited-starts, season-long game.
283	283	53	54	positive	This week  Group A  (Season starts remaining in parentheses)    Chris Kirk (10)  Phil Mickelson (7)  The only other player I would roster from this group is easily Russell Henley, but it’s his first time here. Group B  Jimmy Walker (6)  J.B. Holmes (8)  Ryan Palmer (9)  Charley Hoffman (8)  I’m leaving Reed out as I only have five starts on him remaining, but he does lead the Tour in top 10s. The next four would be Zach Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Jason Kokrak and Kevin Chappell for me.
284	284	23	23	positive	Last year Rose got the job done by finishing inside the Top 25 in Driving Accuracy, Driving Distance, GIR, and Stroked Gained Putting. Fowler is currently 5th in GIR, 26th in strokes gained putting and T29 in Driving distance..the question is can he shake off the Masters as well as the hangover after his well publicized week in Bahama's with Spieth, Thomas and Kaufman.
285	285	4	4	positive	So does this make Tringale the Charley Hoffman of the Zurich Classic? !
286	286	0	0	negative	Berger at $10,100. That's quite a price hike.

290	290	28	28	positive	Since 2012, he’s been inside the top-15 each year at the TPC Louisiana, including his win last year. With three top-10s in his last 7 starts on Tour, Rose’s play of late has been fine, if not spaced out considerably. Three of his past 4 weeks have been off weeks.
291	291	22	23	positive	But I think the rest plays into the hands of the 10th ranked player in the world. Check out these stats on Justin Rose:  Are there even 5 players in the world who you’d trade statistics with than Rose? Gotta take the guy this week…  .

293	293	25	25	positive	He almost won last year, finishing 2nd. Given that he’s made the cut in his last three starts and has a great track record here, Tringale is a player I like a lot this week. And maybe he’ll be fired up that one of his best buddies Rickie Fowler, didn’t invite him to #SB2K16?
294	294	19	19	positive	And maybe he’ll be fired up that one of his best buddies Rickie Fowler, didn’t invite him to #SB2K16? Tringale for a top-20 finish. 3.
295	295	1	2	positive	3. David Hearn  Should I have him in my sleeper category instead of contenders? Oh, well.
296	296	2	2	positive	Oh, well. Hearn is a guy to take a look at this week and there are a few reasons why. Hearn hasn’t finished outside the top-50 here in 5 straight years Hearn finished inside top-15 last week at Valero Hearn is 8th in proximity to the hole on approach shots this year  Every player with at least 4 starts at the Zurich Classic has been cut at least once … Except … Wait for it … David Hearn.

299	299	14	15	negative	Going with HVIII for a top-25 finish in LA. The Man With the Trophy  Daniel Berger  Into the winner’s circle comes Daniel Berger…  Berger’s had a great start to his 2015-2016 season. Top-10s in his last two starts after nursing a sore wrist, he’s also a semi-horse for this week at the TPC Louisiana.
300	300	22	22	negative	He made his first career appearance here last year and comfortably notched a top-10, carding 21 birdies in his 72 holes. Statistically, Berger is a fantastic player from 200+ yards, and when referencing the players here who’ve had success, many of them are great long iron players. From 200-225 yards, Berger is 16th on the Tour in proximity.
301	301	1	1	negative	Statistically, Berger is a fantastic player from 200+ yards, and when referencing the players here who’ve had success, many of them are great long iron players. From 200-225 yards, Berger is 16th on the Tour in proximity. Given his length, his capability for birdies, and the fact that first time winners are a thing here, I have Berger as the horse to beat this week.
302	302	3	3	negative	From 200-225 yards, Berger is 16th on the Tour in proximity. Given his length, his capability for birdies, and the fact that first time winners are a thing here, I have Berger as the horse to beat this week. A FSU Seminole grad, he’ll make a lot of the gators uneasy in the Bayou.

Hearn’s never missed the cut in six tries at the Zurich Classic, and rates Top 25 in the field in Greens in Regulation and Par 3 and 4 birdies or better. Jamie Donaldson – The Welshman hasn’t made a move up the world rankings in a while, but he’s certainly been treading water, with no signs of exhaustion on the horizon.
313	313	23	24	positive	He’ll have to hit more greens than normal, but if he can drive the ball close to field-average, he’ll be in the mix. Cameron Tringale – The lofty results haven’t materialized for Tringale lately, but he’s made three consecutive cuts (60/57/27) and returns to a track where he’s had his most success. In the past five years, Tringale’s caught the early flight from New Orleans just once, with four T20 in that span, including a T2 in 2015.

In the past five years, Tringale’s caught the early flight from New Orleans just once, with four T20 in that span, including a T2 in 2015. Billy Horschel – Despite holding a Zurich Classic win, Billy Ho Train has a pretty spotty record at TPC Louisiana in his career (48/MC/1/MC/26).
315	315	48	48	positive	After battling a tough course in San Antonio last week, things get a bit easier as the tour moves to Louisiana for the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, which is played at the TPC Louisiana. We have some fairly big names playing in this week’s tournament, led by Jason Day and his week-high 16.7% Vegas implied odds of winning. Last week I talked – both in this article and the Flex PGA podcast – that TPC San Antonio was so hard and because no stats really correlated with success, it was important to find pricing inefficiencies on DraftKings and really focus on golfers who are simply better than their price indicates.
316	316	67	67	positive	We will break it down in salary tiers, as shown below, but like last week, let’s first establish a baseline Plus/Minus so we know what we’re looking at when we start filtering the stats. $9k or more: -4.78  $7k – $8.9k: +5.28  $6.9k or less: +6.36  As you can see, the top golfers have really struggled lately at this tournament, and that is despite Justin Rose and Jason Day doing very well last year, the former winning the tournament and finishing with 143 DraftKings points. Let’s now take a look at the stats and we’ll talk through each…  Before we talk about the stats, the top golfers have been so negative and the mid and lower tiers so positive that I think it’s a better visual to have conditional formatting for each individual tier.
317	317	3	3	positive	Lo and behold... Rose produced his best putting performance of the season to date to win. So my hunt is for a ball-striker elite.
318	318	0	1	positive	Luke List 100/1 - made 6 of last 7 cuts with 5 top 30's. Top 50 in SG Tee to Green, Prox 200+, P5 Scoring and Scrambling. T31 here in 2013.
319	319	0	1	positive	Daniel Berger  After a two-week Masters hangover, some of golf's biggest names return this week for the Zurich Classic of New Orleans at TPC Louisiana. World No. 1 Jason Day joins Rickie Fowler and defending champ Justin Rose as the headliners of a 156-player field that will tee off on Thursday.
320	320	3	3	negative	World No. 1 Jason Day joins Rickie Fowler and defending champ Justin Rose as the headliners of a 156-player field that will tee off on Thursday. Rose fired a course-record 22-under par in last year's Zurich Classic, coming from behind on Sunday to upend Day, who shared the 54-hole lead.

Rose fired a course-record 22-under par in last year's Zurich Classic, coming from behind on Sunday to upend Day, who shared the 54-hole lead. Day will certainly have that on his mind, as well as a disappointing performance at the RBC Heritage two weeks ago, where he held a share of the lead going into the weekend but shot a 79 on Saturday to drop out of contention.

This course fits his game much better than Harbour Town, where he collapsed in heavy winds two weeks ago.
328	328	30	30	negative	There will be an abundance of scoring opportunities on this course for the hard-hitting Aussie, especially on two of the Par 5s which he can reach in two.

Berger was priced at $6,200 for The Masters, and after a 10th-place finish there he is now among the elite at $10,100. The massive increase might drive down his ownership a bit, but his recent form is too good to ignore (three straight Top 15s).
331	331	23	23	positive	The massive increase might drive down his ownership a bit, but his recent form is too good to ignore (three straight Top 15s). Berger is a long bomber off the tee (25th on tour) and aggressively chases scoring opportunities. DraftKings rewards players with his skill set.
332	332	7	7	positive	DraftKings rewards players with his skill set. Berger also finished 6th at this event last year, his only appearance. We'll take him at a discount over the likes of Rose, Hoffman and Horschel this week.

334	334	1	2	positive	1. Justin Rose -- Defending champion and the only guy in the field with more than two top-15s here in the last five years. He has four.
335	335	1	1	negative	2. Jason Day -- Day is looking for his third win of the PGA Tour, again on a Pete Dye course, on which he has won two of his four starts. Tied for fourth in 2015.
336	336	1	2	positive	4. Billy Horschel -- The 2013 winner here, Horschel is playing very good golf. He's been knocking on the door for weeks, with another top-five finish at the Texas Open.
337	337	1	2	negative	5. Rickie Fowler -- Fowler makes NOLA a consistent part of his schedule, but he rarely plays extremely well here (T-10 in 2012). That said, he won The Players on a Pete Dye track, has been a top-10 machine this year and is rested after his Bahamas vacation.
338	338	1	2	positive	6. Daniel Berger -- Berger is getting close to a PGA Tour win. He was T-10 at the Masters and T-4 the week prior in Houston.

343	343	29	31	positive	As you get your daily fantasy golf roster ready to go, here is our take on five of the top entered golfers that you may be thinking of drafting. Justin Rose: Rose won this tournament last year, and he’s the number two ranked entrant this year. His salary of $11,800 might seem a little high, but between him being the defending champion and a strong start to the season, and a strong T10 finish at The Masters, Rose is having a much better season than most people predicted him having.
344	344	0	2	positive	Justin Rose: Rose won this tournament last year, and he’s the number two ranked entrant this year. His salary of $11,800 might seem a little high, but between him being the defending champion and a strong start to the season, and a strong T10 finish at The Masters, Rose is having a much better season than most people predicted him having. Honestly, we’d like to pay a lot less for him, but in this field, this price seems right.
345	345	18	18	positive	Honestly, we’d like to pay a lot less for him, but in this field, this price seems right. Rose is a top three threat, and that is undoubtedly going to have a premium place on it. He has been averaging 78.9 fantasy points per tournament, has made the cut 7 out of 8 times, and has made the top ten on 4 occasions.
346	346	13	13	negative	We’re passing on him, but will be looking at him throughout the season. Jason Day: Day is the number one ranked golfer here, and he’s the most expensive at $12,500. That’s extremely expensive, but this is a pretty weak field, and Day is one of the most consistent golfers in the field.
347	347	0	0	negative	Jason Day: Day is the number one ranked golfer here, and he’s the most expensive at $12,500. That’s extremely expensive, but this is a pretty weak field, and Day is one of the most consistent golfers in the field. He is averaging 76.6 fantasy points per tournament, has an average stroke count of 70.5, and has made 6 of 7 cuts.
348	348	12	12	negative	He has 3 top ten finishes, one of which was a win. Day is pricey and we will pass on him because of this, but he’s a justifiable purchase in most cases, as long as you account for this with the rest of your lineup. Rickie Fowler: For us, Fowler is the best choice in the field.
349	349	33	37	negative	Day is pricey and we will pass on him because of this, but he’s a justifiable purchase in most cases, as long as you account for this with the rest of your lineup. Rickie Fowler: For us, Fowler is the best choice in the field. He’s ranked number three with a salary of $11,100.
350	350	6	8	positive	We’ll take cheap talent any time. Smylie Kaufman: Kaufman is an underrated golfer, but one you should still strongly consider. His salary of $9,500 is attractive considering he’s made 12 of 14 cuts and has an average fantasy score of 72.5.
351	351	6	6	positive	This is a weaker field, and Kaufman has potential to shine here. That would have put him in possible top ten contention if he had finished stronger. He had a horrid Sunday, finishing 9 over par for the day, but 7 over total.
352	352	47	47	positive	Total driving is what’s most important in our mind and we’ll be looking hard at the top 60 list when selecting players for the week. The strange anomaly just so happens to have the 2nd best history at this tournament, and that’s Phil Mickelson. So what makes Phil special?
353	353	22	22	positive	The strange anomaly just so happens to have the 2nd best history at this tournament, and that’s Phil Mickelson. So what makes Phil special? It’s his scrambling.
354	354	23	24	positive	This also helps the above mentioned players like Jim Furyk, who was number 1 in scrambling two years ago. Also, please note that Webb Simpson has a terrific record here and that’s because it’s his home course. It’s rare that you have a course where you can arguably have 6 legit eagle chances, as the Par 5’s are reachable in two and there are two drivable Par 4’s for the very long hitters.
355	355	32	33	positive	Throw in three 200 yard plus Par 3 holes, one being 250 yards, and you can see why long driving or long hitters have chances to score here. It’s no coincidence that Rory Mcilroy, the best driver of the golf ball, wins here. So in order, we want Total Driving (With a lean on the Longer Drivers), Scrambling, Approaches/GIR from 200 plus yards, and Putting.
356	356	20	21	positive	Now for the squad. A: Phil Mickelson – Dustin Johnson  B: Rory Mcilroy – J.B. Holmes – Webb Simpson – Hideki Matsuyama  C: Paul Casey – Bryson Dechambeau  –  WE LOVE FANTASY ACES! TO WIN CASH, CLICK HERE.
357	357	16	16	positive	His putter is terrible, but if it gets hot, he should have a shot here. 2) Gary Woodland – Having a solid year but with no big finishes. Last week, he played pretty well, and it’s a good sign coming into a bomber’s paradise.
358	358	29	30	positive	Also, form does matter, so we will also be looking for players in form and with solid course history. Top 10 Rankings | PGA Wells Fargo Championship 2016  10) Webb Simpson – Home course boy and has two Top 4’s here in his last four tries. He’s not playing that well this year, but his course knowledge may be enough to over come his recent play.
359	359	10	11	positive	Not an elite play here, but should be respected. 8) Hideki Matsuyama – He’s made both of his cuts at this tournament, but with no high finishes. He’s long, but not elite long, however, he’s one of the best Total Drivers around.
360	360	9	10	positive	A great spot for his game right here. 3) Rickie Fowler – He hasn’t missed the cut in five attempts, with a win and a 6th place finish. He only has one Top 10 in his last four tour stops, so he’s not firing on all cylinders right now, however, you must respect his record here.
361	361	29	30	positive	He only has one Top 10 in his last four tour stops, so he’s not firing on all cylinders right now, however, you must respect his record here. 2) Phil Mickelson – He’s coming off back to back missed cuts on tour but you must respect the eight Top 10’s in 12 starts. Even though he’s never won here, it’s one of his favourite stops on tour.
362	362	0	0	positive	Rory has already won here twice already and has three other top 10 finishes! He also holds the 72 hole scoring record and the two best 18 hole scores!
363	363	15	15	positive	If you're running with course history above all else, it doesn't get much better than Phil with 10 top 12 finishes here in 12 starts!
364	364	14	15	positive	"If you want to put an emphasis on the ""Hometown Favourite"" strategy this week Webb Simpson has to be considered living minutes from the clubhouse. Other hometown names include: de Jonge, Kokrak, Laird, Reifers and Wagner."
365	365	4	4	positive	Stallings, Varner III, and Kizzire all had strong finishes at the Zurich today firing final rounds of 66/69/68 respectively. Can they keep that momentum rolling this week or will fatigue play a factor?
366	366	57	58	positive	Arguably best known among fans for The Green Mile – the closing trio of holes on which even par over four rounds last year meant a gain of 3.4 strokes on the field – what’s often overlooked is how scorable the first 15 holes set up and how the course rewards all facets of a skill set. Rory McIlroy broke through for his first PGA TOUR title here in 2010, but the old bentgrass greens were removed for MiniVerde ultra dwarf Bermuda putting surfaces following the 2013 edition. This was done in preparation for the 2017 PGA Championship.
367	367	31	31	positive	(As a result, next year’s Wells Fargo Championship will be contested at Eagle Point Golf Club in Wilmington, North Carolina.) In Quail Hollow’s second go-round with new greens last year, all McIlroy did was convert 27 birdies en route to a tournament-record, 21-under 267, featuring a course-record 61 in the third round. His aggregate was seven shots clear of a pair of runners-up who equaled J.B. Holmes’ winning pace in 2014.
368	368	45	46	positive	His aggregate was seven shots clear of a pair of runners-up who equaled J.B. Holmes’ winning pace in 2014. To illustrate how Quail Hollow benefited all, look no further than the fact that McIlroy led the field in distance of all drives (311.5) while runner-up Webb Simpson paced the field in fairways hit. McIlroy also ranked T2 in greens in regulation and first in par-4 scoring.
369	369	14	14	positive	To illustrate how Quail Hollow benefited all, look no further than the fact that McIlroy led the field in distance of all drives (311.5) while runner-up Webb Simpson paced the field in fairways hit. McIlroy also ranked T2 in greens in regulation and first in par-4 scoring. Most importantly, as you’d infer on a scorable, stock par 72, he went wild on the par 5s.
370	370	28	29	positive	Quail Hollow will continue to get more talk in each subsequent year, as the 2017 PGA Championship will be played there along with the 2021 Presidents Cup, stateside. Phil Mickelson gave this timeless quote, never holding back his opinions on a golf course and it’s design:  “As beautifully designed as this golf course is tee-to-green, the greens are by far the worst-designed greens we play on tour…I would say that 18 would be the worst green that we have on tour – except that it’s not even the worst on this golf course. Number 12 is.”  Last Year’s Wells Fargo Top-10  Full 2016 Field at Wells Fargo  Click here for a full field list.

372	372	11	12	positive	This Week’s Picks  Three from the Fairway (Contenders)  1. Rory McIlroy  This pick may seem like as much of a slam dunk as Justin Rose’s picking last week at the Zurich before a disappointing MC. But I’m going with the man who’s won here twice since 2010 and who’s game fits this course wonderfully.
373	373	20	20	positive	But I’m going with the man who’s won here twice since 2010 and who’s game fits this course wonderfully. In Rory’s off-week, he made waves when he proclaimed when he will not be wearing any Nike gear at the 2016 Olympic games– to no fault of his own. But the focus shall remain this week at the Wells Fargo and a venue where he’s been inside the top-2 in almost half of his starts here.
374	374	18	18	positive	He has great momentum heading into the event with 3 of his past 4 starts resulting in top-10s. Rory’s a total horse for the course, but given Jimmy Walker, Justin Rose and more “horse for the course missed cuts” that have happened lately, he’s not as much of a lock as he seems to be. But in my book, I’ll still trust Rors this week.

A second round 66 propelled him up the leaderboard and I’m optimistic with another round of golf, Woodland could have worked his way up the leaderboard further yet.

Historically, Stenson has been brutal at Quail Hollow. In 5 starts since 2007, he’s missed three cuts and has finished inside the top-50 exactly zero times.
380	380	25	25	positive	In 5 starts since 2007, he’s missed three cuts and has finished inside the top-50 exactly zero times. But I’m taking this play because of Stenson’s form (two top-3s in three starts) and the way that this course SHOULD fit his game. He’s one of the Tour’s leaders in scoring on long par-4s and Quail Hollow has quite a few of those.
381	381	27	27	positive	He’s one of the Tour’s leaders in scoring on long par-4s and Quail Hollow has quite a few of those. I’m going to ignore history and fit Stenson into my rosters this week.

386	386	32	32	positive	But I’m going to go the optimistic route here with Johnson this week, given his top-15s in 5 straight events and three top-5s in last 4 stroke play events. His length, like McIlroy, will give him an advantage on a course where long players have been able to do well. He’s gained strokes with his putter in 5 straight events and is 10th on the year in strokes gained tee-to-green.

389	389	11	12	positive	I’ll give him the nod. Here’s what we’re looking at with Rickie Fowler this week. The Wells Fargo in 2012 was the well-documented first victory of the promising youngsters career, a win that seemed late to those who felt he was too highly touted.

394	394	104	105	positive	Wells Fargo Championship  Defending Champ: Rory McIlroy  FNTSY Sports Network’s Pat Mayo and Geoff Fienberg debate their Wells Fargo Championship picks and the week in betting at this week’s PGA Tour stop at Quail Hollow…  Wells Fargo Championship Field  156 Players | Top 70 & Ties Make the Cut | First Tee Time: 7:00am EST  After a few weeks of post-Masters malaise, the Wells Fargo Championship is one of the strongest non-Major, non-WGC events of the season. Two-Time Quail Hollow victor, and defending champ Rory McIlory is the class of the field, but 2012 winner Rickie Fowler, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott, Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson , Patrick Reed, Branden Grace , Hideki Matsuyama and JB Holmes are all Top 20 players in world, lurking about to prevent a Rory repeat. The second class of golfers is no joke either.
395	395	6	7	positive	Use Rickie Fowler in his spot. Adam Scott – It’s probably easier to go with the track records of Fowler (past champ) or Phil (seven T10s the last 11 years; no cuts missed), but I like Scott in this spot. He’s destined to be lowly owned because of the other names in the Yahoo!
396	396	3	4	positive	Don’t get cute. Jason Kokrak – I was heavy on Kokrak at this event last year with disastrous results. He tanked with a day one 77, got back to the cut line on Friday, then proceeded to go bogey/bogey to finish his round and rip my heart out.
397	397	7	7	positive	I’ll go back to the well, though. Kokrak certainly has the length (5th DD) and has no troubles taming the Par 5s (22nd birdies or better), in addition he almost pulled out a win at a corollary course (Riviera) back in February. Hideki Matsyuama – Any course where gaining strokes tee-to-green (5th) and birdie rate (1st) is essential, make sure to slot Hideki on to your team.

401	401	1	2	positive	8. Kevin Chappell – He’s going to get that breakthrough win somewhere, and probably sometime soon. He’s made four of his five cuts at Quail Hollow, including back-to-back top 20s and enters on the heels of back-to-back top 10s.

403	403	24	25	positive	Awarding him a roster spot will be banking on him returning to form, which is a move that I typically reserve for tournaments only. Kevin Chappell ($7,900) is the cheapest player in the field with at least 2% Vegas implied odds to win. He has missed one cut in his last four tournaments, but finished at least top 10 in the other three.
404	404	23	23	positive	He has missed one cut in his last four tournaments, but finished at least top 10 in the other three. The concern with Chappell is that his solid recent form has come with a decreased driving distance, which knocks him down in my rankings a bit, especially with known-bomber Jamie Lovemark ($7,900) at the same price. I like Lovemark for all the same reasons as last week, and though his performance late on Monday was upsetting, his 309.5 Long-Term Driving Distance and solid recent play fits exactly what I am looking for at Quail Hollow.

407	407	24	25	positive	I will be owning a lot of shares of Rory and I’ll be hoping his high price tag will keep his ownership percentages down. Justin Rose ($10,000) – Justin Rose is in a unique spot because he makes a great cash game option but also could be a sneaky GPP play as well. His game suits Quail Hollow well and coming off a missed cut last week where he was +30% owned I expect his ownership to be very low.
408	408	27	27	positive	His game suits Quail Hollow well and coming off a missed cut last week where he was +30% owned I expect his ownership to be very low. Rose being priced at only $10,000 is a steal for the number 10 ranked golfer in the world. Phil Mickelson ($9,500) – Phil Mickelson has an immaculate course history at Quail Hollow, with 7 top 10 finishes without ever missing a cut.
409	409	48	49	positive	The top five players in the world will be competing at this event, including defending champion Rickie Fowler and FedEx Cup champion Jordan Spieth. Fowler, a fan favorite, pulled off the incredible finish in last year’s tourney, playing the final four holes in 11 strokes and then defeating Sergio Garcia and Kevin Kisner in three-way playoff. I mean, what else would the wifi be called at The Players Championship?

438	438	3	4	positive	And so on. Rickie Fowler added his exploits at TPC Sawgrass to the highlight reel a year ago, but instead of a singular shot, it was the aggregate that defies belief. Buried in the eighth-to-last pairing in the final round, he closed birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie.
439	439	26	26	positive	Buried in the eighth-to-last pairing in the final round, he closed birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie. He and Kevin Kisner then outlasted Sergio Garcia in the scheduled three-hole playoff before Fowler emerged with a statement victory in sudden death with a birdie at 17. For the week, he circled birdies in five of six trips through the alleged knee-knocker.
440	440	11	11	positive	Oh, and so much for its label as a ball-striker’s track. Fowler ranked a middling T43 in fairways hit and T51 in greens in regulation on the par 72 last year. However, he was second in converting his relatively limited scoring opportunities into birdies or better.
441	441	2	3	positive	It’s not. Sergio Garcia – Sergio owns the longest active cuts-made streak at THE PLAYERS with 12 in a row: every year since 2004. He’s a former winner, lost in a playoff last year, and has posted T10s each of the last three years.
442	442	13	14	positive	If you want a contrarian pick from this grouping, go with Chris Kirk. Henrik Stenson – Stenson lost the active-cut-streak title last week at Quail Hollow, but now he gets a venue far more conducive to his skills. Always maligned for hitting 3-wood over driver, the 2009 winner won’t hear anything about that choice this week.
443	443	18	18	positive	Always maligned for hitting 3-wood over driver, the 2009 winner won’t hear anything about that choice this week. Stenson will keep it on the fairway and hammer the greens, he just needs to putt above average for the week to contend again. Rory McIlroy – Strangely, Rory hasn’t won’t this season.
444	444	24	25	positive	Stenson will keep it on the fairway and hammer the greens, he just needs to putt above average for the week to contend again. Rory McIlroy – Strangely, Rory hasn’t won’t this season. Thats OK though.
445	445	3	3	positive	Thats OK though. McIlroy has posted three consecutive T10s at Sawgrass (T8/T6/T8) and is coming off a HOT FIYA finish at Wells Fargo. Kevin Chappell – With the safe duo of Rory and Stenson on the roster, let’s take a shot with Chappell.
446	446	30	30	positive	McIlroy has posted three consecutive T10s at Sawgrass (T8/T6/T8) and is coming off a HOT FIYA finish at Wells Fargo. Kevin Chappell – With the safe duo of Rory and Stenson on the roster, let’s take a shot with Chappell. While the course history is rough (MC/T26/T68/MC/T69), Chappell has never been playing at this high of a level.
447	447	18	18	positive	Plus, in the most important skill players need this week, scrambling, Reed is still dominating – 3rd. Brandon Grace – It’s easy to overlook Grace in a field with so much talent, but that would be unwise. He won at a Dye-track less than a month ago and followed it up with another T10 the next week.
448	448	3	3	positive	I'll be giving Vegas a look this week. He was T42 last year at TPC and T5 at the Zurich Classic two weeks ago. He also sits 10th on tour in GIR% which is being touted as a key stat.
449	449	0	0	positive	Sergio has the longest consecutive cut streak at The Players - 12
450	450	0	0	positive	Grace (45/1) Z. Johnson (66/1) and Knox (90/1) ew 7 places 1/4 for the player's. Maybe Mcilroy if windsor goes well tonight .
451	451	1	2	positive	@gfienberg17 Matthew Fitzpatrick at 151-1 caught my eye.
452	452	24	24	positive	"The 'Fifth Major' is upon us and Steve Rawlings takes an in-depth look at the test awaiting the world's best at Sawgrass this week...  ""Grace is a quite brilliant scrambler with really impressive recent GIR stats and if he's refreshed and he can hold his form, he's a major player this week. He's currently the 11th best player in the world according to the official world rankings and I couldn't quite work out why he was as big as [60.0]."" Tournament History  Jack Nicklaus won the inaugural Players Championship in 1974 and he went on to take the title in 1976 and 1978 as well."
453	453	56	57	positive	He makes no appeal at all at around [20.0]. Selections    Given the last two PGA Tour winners have begun the week as [1000.0] shots, that this event often produces a shock winner, and that the in-running trends are strong, it makes little sense going overboard before the off but the one I really like here is Branden Grace. The South African sat alongside Fowler in a tie for third at halfway last year but weekend rounds of 73 and 75 saw him slip to 42nd so his aptitude for the venue isn't immediately apparent.
454	454	29	30	positive	He's currently the 11th best player in the world according to the official world rankings and I couldn't quite work out why he was as big as [60.0]. Selection  Branden Grace @ [60.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [500.0]    Update - 16.00 - May 10, 2016  Just a very quick update to say I've followed Ian at Sports Betting Index in with Fabian Gomez. He's a favorite of mine given I was on board at a triple figure price when he won the Sony Open in January anyway and as Ian quite rightly highlights on Twitter (@SBIdotcom) he played superbly after round one last week and the course really should suit.
455	455	2	2	negative	DJ and Bubba have made a combined 15 starts at The Players - their best finish is T34.
456	456	0	1	positive	Russell Knox 100/1 - 25th or better in Driving Acc, Scrambling, P4 Scoring, Proximity &amp; Bogey Avoidance. T2 last time out at Harbour Town.
457	457	28	28	negative	"Golfstat cites the least telling stats for this week: driving distance, going for it distance and GIR. Based on these the worst ""course fits"" are: Gonzales, Pinckney, Henry, Ortiz, Summerhays and Laird"
458	458	19	19	negative	Some sit calls here backed up by some good rationale by The Fantasy Golf: Mickelson, DJ, Bubba, Snedeker, Walker, Berger
459	459	3	4	positive	An interesting play. Louis Oosthuizen – We would have assumed that his record here would have been better than the 2 of 5 cuts made, with a high of 19th. He’s played well in Florida over the last two years, so we’re fans.
460	460	17	18	negative	Fantasy Golf PGA Expert Picks | The Players Championship 2016 | DraftKings Tiers  We’re recovering from the Justin Thomas blues, as we had a core of Rory Mcilory, Andrew Loupe and Justin Thomas last week. The guy couldn’t make a putt. When Andrew Loupe does the job for you and Thomas can’t do his part of the bargain…….someone must die……..and someone did.
461	461	15	15	negative	The guy couldn’t make a putt. When Andrew Loupe does the job for you and Thomas can’t do his part of the bargain…….someone must die……..and someone did. I won’t say who, as that could only get me in trouble.
462	462	8	9	negative	If he’s the right price, we’d take him. Justin Rose – Misses the cut two weeks back and then roars back with a Top 5 finish last week. You would have thought, based on his style of play that his record would be much better than the 6 of 12 cuts made with only one Top 10.
463	463	12	13	negative	His early to mid 2015 woes seem to be over…..seem to be. Justin Thomas – He’s super cheap. Last week, he only made two birdies, but that means he only made 5 bogeys.
464	464	10	11	positive	We think he’s an interesting play this week. TIER 6  Emiliano Grillo– Only made one Top 10 this year, but it was a win. He’s also made 11 of 13 cuts, and all of his Florida ones.
465	465	15	16	negative	Avoiding disaster is. Players with solid histories at this course with at least two starts: Davis Love (many missed cuts but 2 wins), Sergio Garcia, Zach Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Jim Furyk, Lee Westwood, Hideki Matsuyama, Rory Mcilory (3 Top 10’s in last 3 years), Luke Donald, Adam Scott, and Rickie Fowler ( 1st, 2nd and missed cuts). There are a bunch of straight shooting guys in this group, so that will be our focus this week.
466	466	12	13	negative	We think he wants to prove a point this week though. 1) Rory Mcilroy – He’s coming off a nice finish at Quail Hollow, as he usually does, and he’s now at a spot he’s loved over the last three years, with an 8th, 6th, and an 8th. He’s a terrific ball striker, and he’ll win this tournament eventually, if not this year.
467	467	17	18	positive	Now for the rankings. King Kong Bundy Top 5 Sleepers | PGA The Players Championship 2016  5) Emiliano Grillo– Only made one Top 10 this year, but it was a win. He’s also made 11 of 13 cuts, and all of his Florida ones.
468	468	3	4	positive	The fact that Sergio Garcia is so confident playing on tough courses is why ESPN.com's Michael Collins says the golfer has to be your go-to pick. (0:44)  As part of ESPN Fantasy's efforts to give daily gamers intel on whom to target in DFS, our fantasy golf experts are here to share which players they view as building blocks for this weekend's event. The panel for the Players Championship features ESPN.com's Jason Sobel, Bob Harig, Michael Collins, Kevin Maguire, Matt Barrie and Jonathan Coachman, as well as FantasyGolfInsider's Jeff Bergerson, Zach Turcotte and Roger Casey and Dailyfantasybootcamp's Alvin Zeidenfeld and David Jayne.
469	469	34	35	negative	The past few weeks, Spieth has had nothing to focus on other than this week's Players, and I expect him to come out and avenge his missed cut from last year. Zachary Turcotte - Rory McIlroy ($11,700)  Rory McIlroy looks to be getting closer to putting together four straight solid rounds and was very close this past weekend at Quail Hollow following a rocky start during the first nine holes Thursday morning. By Sunday, he looked unstoppable, nearly rallying to win the event with an impressive 66 to close out the weekend.
470	470	44	45	negative	Photo via PGA Tour golfer Rickie Fowler  The Players Championship isn’t one of golf’s four majors, but it might as well be. The 2016 tournament is just as stacked as any, with all members of the “Big Four” — Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Rickie Fowler — scheduled to tee off at TPC Sawgrass this week. But with such a stacked field comes some tough decisions for daily fantasy golf players.
471	471	23	24	negative	Luckily for you, we’re here to help with our top five daily fantasy golfers for this week, along with a few extra names. Rory McIlroy  If McIlroy’s last three starts are any indication, the former world No. 1 golfer should be a major factor this week.
472	472	9	9	negative	1 golfer should be a major factor this week. McIlroy has finished in the top 10 in each of his last three starts, and he’s also earned top 10s in each of his last three appearances at TPC Sawgrass. Rickie Fowler  A major championship still eludes Fowler, but he earned the biggest win of his career last year at The Players, where he beat Sergio Garcia and Kevin Kisner in a three-hole playoff.
473	473	7	8	negative	Other Top Contenders  Jason Day, Henrik Stenson, Jim Furyk, Billy Horschel, Justin Rose  Thumbnail photo via John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports Images He also has finished in the top 25 in each of his two starts at TPC Sawgrass. He has made the cut in 10 of his starts, and he has finished in the top 25 in eight of those events.
474	474	14	15	negative	Fuzzy Zoeller holds the tournament record for most birdies, 26, also set in 1994. Rory McIlroy had 25 in 2014. The course record, 63, has been set multiple times but most recently by Roberto Castro (2013) and Martin Kaymer (2014).
475	475	14	15	negative	#JustSayNo. The Field  Favorites  In order of preference for this week and this tournament  Rory McIlroy: Leads the parade of ball-strikers this week after closing with 66 at Quail Hollow Club last week; top ten in strokes-gained: tee-to-green, birdie average and scoring average; MC in his first three tries at TPC Sawgrass but he’s put 10 of his next 12 rounds at par or better and is 24-under par; made 25 birdies in ’14, one off the tournament record. Rickie Fowler: Last year speaks for itself as his five-under finish got him into the playoff which he eventually won; Masters disappointment is behind him with T-20 at Zurich and T-4 (after leading after 54-holes) at Wells Fargo; sits No.1 in the all-around category and is top 10 in strokes-gained: tee-to-green and is second in strokes-gained: total; also has T-2 in the last four years.
476	476	29	30	negative	Fades  Players to avoid and there’s plenty of them  Bubba Watson: Simple, he doesn’t like it here and his numbers back that up; best finish is T-38. Jim Furyk: Has openly admitted he doesn’t care for this track multiple times; let him work back into shape as there will be plenty of chances to burn him down the road. Dustin Johnson: Some things in life make no sense.
477	477	21	22	negative	Look for Berger to be a popular option at this price this week which has me further leaning towards fading him. Justin Thomas ($7,200) – Justin Thomas is another example of a golfer who’s game does not suit TPC Sawgrass particularly well. Thomas hits a long ball off the tee coupled with relatively inaccurate approach stats in the middle yardage gaps.
478	478	0	1	negative	Justin Thomas ($7,200) – Justin Thomas is another example of a golfer who’s game does not suit TPC Sawgrass particularly well. Thomas hits a long ball off the tee coupled with relatively inaccurate approach stats in the middle yardage gaps. Plus, Thomas has not seemed himself this year at all with missed cuts or double digit over par finishing scores in 5 of his last 10 events on Tour.
479	479	0	0	negative	Thomas hits a long ball off the tee coupled with relatively inaccurate approach stats in the middle yardage gaps. Plus, Thomas has not seemed himself this year at all with missed cuts or double digit over par finishing scores in 5 of his last 10 events on Tour. I will be looking to stay off of Thomas until further notice.
480	480	1	1	negative	Plus, Thomas has not seemed himself this year at all with missed cuts or double digit over par finishing scores in 5 of his last 10 events on Tour. I will be looking to stay off of Thomas until further notice. James Hahn ($6,400) – Despite an impressive win last week for Hahn, I don’t expect him to follow up his winning performance with anything spectacular.
481	481	27	27	negative	He has a 6th, and two 8th’s in the last three years here, and could be ready to break through this week. Things line up well for Rory this week, and at worst I think he gets another top 8. 2.
482	482	1	2	negative	Fades  Kevin Kisner … Just like three weeks ago at the RBC Heritage, where he lost in a playoff last year, gamers need to beware his return to TPC Sawgrass, also the site of his loss in a playoff last year. Dating back to an even-par 70 to close the Sony Open in Hawaii in mid-January, he’s broken par just once in 23 rounds. Dustin Johnson … Winless in the last 14 months, but he’s been on fire with top fives in four of his last five starts.
483	483	22	23	negative	If only he could put four rounds together since he’s closed out the last three editions with 73, 76 and 76, respectively. Ryan Moore … It’s a rarity that he lands in this section, but he could be an aggressive complement in a DFS lineup given a 7-for-9 slate at TPC Sawgrass. That record is devoid of a top 25.
484	484	15	16	negative	Also coming off consecutive missed cuts for just the second time in nearly three years. Brandt Snedeker … Course history favors so few in the field of 144 that even one strong week shouldn’t be dismissed outright. He has two, but while his body of work features a T12 in his debut in 2007 and a T8 in 2013, it also includes five missed cuts.
485	485	28	29	negative	He has two, but while his body of work features a T12 in his debut in 2007 and a T8 in 2013, it also includes five missed cuts. Jason Dufner … Uninspiring 5-for-7 at TPC Sawgrass for a superb ball-striker. Only one top 30 and that was five years ago when he tied for sixth.
486	486	15	16	negative	Only one top 30 and that was five years ago when he tied for sixth. Graeme McDowell … Zero top 25s among six weekends in eight appearances at TPC Sawgrass. And since a solo fifth at The Honda Classic in late February, both of his finishes outside the top 25 were in (no-cut) WGCs.
487	487	24	25	negative	And since a solo fifth at The Honda Classic in late February, both of his finishes outside the top 25 were in (no-cut) WGCs. Justin Thomas … I usually dismiss a poor showing at the Match Play, but he’s yet to regroup since going 0-3-0 at that tournament in late March. And while we’re in the annual stretch of challenging tracks, the PGA TOUR sophomore has signed for 14 over-par scores in his last 18 stroke-play rounds.
488	488	26	27	negative	And while we’re in the annual stretch of challenging tracks, the PGA TOUR sophomore has signed for 14 over-par scores in his last 18 stroke-play rounds. Paul Casey … Dynamic in any given week and statistically strong, but where you draw the line in this field must be done conservatively. He’s cashed only twice in nine trips, but both were top 15s.
489	489	13	14	negative	Even when he looked attractive at Quail Hollow, he disappeared on the weekend. Shane Lowry … Way too quiet in his first year with a PGA TOUR card. Currently 123rd in the FedExCup standings with no better than a T35 (Doral) in his last seven starts.
490	490	12	13	negative	Also missed the cut in his debut at TPC Sawgrass last year. Scott Piercy … Prime to challenge his personal-best T22 in 2009, but he’s missed four cuts here since. Otherwise nails this season.
491	491	4	5	negative	Otherwise nails this season. Boo Weekley … Surprisingly poor record at TPC Sawgrass where his ball-striking prowess has mattered little. Just one top 40 (T21, 2008) among four paydays in eight trips.
492	492	27	28	negative	Also misfiring of late with no better than a pair of T35s in his last eight starts, but all that does is cement your decision to sidestep. Bryce Molder … In a groove of late with six consecutive cuts made, two of the last three of which were top 10s, but he’s yet to find form at TPC Sawgrass in six starts. Bernd Wiesberger … In short, the Austrian is still searching for footing and friction in the U.S.
493	493	35	36	negative	Bryce Molder … In a groove of late with six consecutive cuts made, two of the last three of which were top 10s, but he’s yet to find form at TPC Sawgrass in six starts. Bernd Wiesberger … In short, the Austrian is still searching for footing and friction in the U.S. This is his second start at TPC Sawgrass.
494	494	11	12	negative	Despite a MC &amp; T41 finish in his last two events, Paul Casey's Recent Adj. Round (68.8) and Long-Term Adj. Round (69.1) scores are similar.
495	495	11	12	negative	What is it about the course that suits you so well? KEEGAN BRADLEY: It’s not something that I can 100% put my finger on. Just seems that the holes fit my eyes nicely, the greens are perfect.
496	496	15	15	negative	@HitTheHighDraw I will take the premium with the money I will save by not rostering Keegan.
497	497	66	66	negative	Makes for a semi-sneaky great OAD play this week. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Phil MC)    Louis Oosthuizen– I’m 1 for 1 in my Louis BUST picks this year, as I spot on nailed him missing the cut at the Shell Houston Open, despite him being a favorite that week, and I’m calling for the same this week. Always a high WD risk, avoid Louis this week and thank me later.
498	498	57	57	negative	HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Phil MC)    Louis Oosthuizen– I’m 1 for 1 in my Louis BUST picks this year, as I spot on nailed him missing the cut at the Shell Houston Open, despite him being a favorite that week, and I’m calling for the same this week. Always a high WD risk, avoid Louis this week and thank me later. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK-BOLD-PLAY-OF-THE-WEEK (Last week: Leishman t-64th)    Martin Flores– Going extra BOLD here this week with my man Martin, who is teeing it up in his first PGA Tour event since the Sanderson Farms Championship in November, where he finished t-12th.
499	499	11	12	negative	Currently 37th in adjusted scoring and T8 in par-4 scoring. Fades  Brandt Snedeker ... At some point, he's going to burst out of his relative funk and showcase his skill set. For the time being, he's merely grinding.
500	500	9	10	negative	Hasn't pegged it at Las Colinas since the redo. Louis Oosthuizen ... Returned from a back injury at THE PLAYERS and promptly missed the cut by eight strokes.
501	501	6	7	negative	Also 0-for-2 post-redo at Las Colinas. Justin Leonard ... It always feels wrong not to endorse a Texan in his home state, but he's survived only one cut in the last three editions of the Nelson, and that was a T43 last year when he shot 70 in every round.
502	502	9	10	negative	Same record at Las Colinas since 2009 (T40, 2011). Boo Weekley ... Since the season resumed after the holidays, he failed to record a top 25.
503	503	35	36	negative	PGATOUR.com always publishes the official field on Friday. If you're in any form of a drop-add league, monitoring its release can prove to be valuable if you're waiting for someone to return to competition (like Patrick Cantlay this week) or any of the aforementioned commitments published elsewhere to hold. Just a reminder that TPC Four Seasons-Las Colinas underwent a significant redesign prior to the 2008 edition of the HP Byron Nelson Championship.
504	504	30	31	negative	His slate at Las Colinas featured a similar mixed bag with a T2 (2010), a T8 (2011) and four results outside the top 30 since the redo. Returning to Competition  Patrick Cantlay ... First live action since opening the Web.com Tour Finals with a solo second. He played through a fractured vertebrae.
505	505	24	25	negative	While gamers will appreciate the knowledge that it's not a physical issue, he's riding a stretch of six consecutive rounds over par. Notable WDs  Patrick Reed ... Baby due on May 26, but he's not taking any chances on missing the birth. Pat Perez ...
506	506	21	22	negative	Notable WDs  Patrick Reed ... Baby due on May 26, but he's not taking any chances on missing the birth. Pat Perez ... Bit of a blow across the board.
507	507	14	15	negative	He's survived 14 consecutive cuts and tied for ninth at Las Colinas in 2012. Roberto Castro ... Third time this season that he's withdrawn after the commitment deadline and before the tournament (Mayakoba; Bay Hill)  One-and-Done  One-and-doners often ask about future tournaments for which you should consider saving a golfer. It's part of the strategy for formats that allow you to make your selection in real time as opposed all at once at the beginning of the season.
508	508	1	1	negative	On Spieth. When he won the TOUR Champs, week before had shot 65-66...72-70. Said his game felt very poor.
509	509	59	60	negative	The AT&T Byron Nelson was a fascinating tournament because it was the battle of a lot of top-tier players trying to win without their best stuff, including the guy who won, Sergio Garcia, who put two balls in the water in the final round. Brooks Koepka tried to hang on for his second PGA Tour win but couldn't, while Jordan Spieth couldn't keep the smoke-and-mirrors show going with his short game. This week, the Tour makes the short trek to Ft. Worth for the Dean & Deluca Invitational.
510	510	1	2	negative	1. Kevin Chappell -- I'm probably, actually, I know I'm overvaluing Chappell this week, but he's been playing fantastic golf. He's this year's Kevin Kisner, already with three runner-up showings this season, including at The Players.
511	511	0	1	negative	Kevin Chappell -- I'm probably, actually, I know I'm overvaluing Chappell this week, but he's been playing fantastic golf. He's this year's Kevin Kisner, already with three runner-up showings this season, including at The Players. 2.
512	512	1	2	negative	2. Jordan Spieth -- Last week, we downplayed Spieth at the Nelson, suggesting that he might not be reliable for all 72 holes. Well, that happened.
513	513	4	4	negative	Well, that happened. But Spieth says he found something in the final round that could help him at a place where he was runner-up last year and in the top 15 the last three years. 3.
514	514	1	2	negative	3. Matt Kuchar -- Kooch is back, baby! He's finished in the top three in his last two starts, and he seems to be beaming with confidence.
515	515	1	2	negative	4. Charley Hoffman -- Hoffman is playing well just about anywhere these days, finishing T-12 last week at the Byron Nelson. He was T-10 here last year, and this is the kind of course that suits him...namely, not too long.
516	516	1	2	negative	6. Chris Kirk -- I stuck my neck out for Chris Kirk at The Players, and he might have validated that rating had he not withdrawn. The defending champion loves Colonial, and he's playing well overall.
517	517	1	2	negative	7. Zach Johnson -- This is a Zach Johnson Special. He finished in the top four here, including a win, from 2011-13.
518	518	24	25	negative	Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Chris Kirk - $9,700  2. Kevin Chappell - $9,600  3.
519	519	6	7	negative	Chris Kirk - $9,700  2. Kevin Chappell - $9,600  3. Ryan Palmer - $8,100  4.
520	520	10	11	negative	Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel - Zach Johnson ($10,700)  If you could build a course that suited Johnson's game, it would probably look very much like Colonial, site of this week's event. He's already won twice here and though his last five starts haven't shown any signs of being on the verge of another win, things will change for him the moment he steps onto the first tee box this week.
521	521	39	43	negative	He's already won twice here and though his last five starts haven't shown any signs of being on the verge of another win, things will change for him the moment he steps onto the first tee box this week. Matt Barrie - Matt Kuchar ($11,000)  Kuchar is finding his game at the right time, and that syncs up nicely with this week's tournament at Colonial. He is coming off consecutive tournaments finishing in the top three.
522	522	14	14	negative	He was the runner-up in 2013, and cards three top-20 finishes at Colonial CC. Kuchar's hot play rewards him with a win this week. Jonathan Coachman - Adam Scott ($11,300)  He had a great Florida swing and now watching the likes of Jason Day and Rory McIlroy win tournaments will fire him up this week.
523	523	45	46	negative	Na succeeds with accuracy off the tee instead of distance and that translates well here as just one of the 17 players that finished t-10th or better at this event last year ranked inside the top 20 in driving distance that week. Bob Harig - Zach Johnson ($10,700)  The reigning Open champion has struggled lately, with no top-25 finishes in his past five starts. But he does love Colonial, a perfect place to find his game.
524	524	12	12	negative	But he does love Colonial, a perfect place to find his game. Johnson is a two-time winner of the event and it's all-time leading money winner. Michael Collins - Adam Scott ($11,300)  Poor guy, he's been ruined since the anchor ban.
525	525	30	31	negative	With his price actually dropping on the heels of a solid performance a week ago, we are getting a great bargain on a solid golfer this week. Jason Rouslin - Charley Hoffman ($10,400)  Charley's stellar season continued last week at the Bryon Nelson where he finished t-12. He has carded seven top-20 finishes on the year including a win at the Valero in San Antonio.
526	526	37	37	negative	He also holds a perfect six-for-six here at Colonial including three top-20's with his best finish last year being a t-10. Coming in at a respectable salary, and sitting 11th in the Ryder Cup standings look for Charley to earn yet another top-10 finish as he tries to make a push for a spot on the team this fall. Taras Pitra - Jordan Spieth ($12,800)  Jordan Spieth at $12,800 is my favorite play this week for GPPs.
527	527	41	42	negative	Coming in at a respectable salary, and sitting 11th in the Ryder Cup standings look for Charley to earn yet another top-10 finish as he tries to make a push for a spot on the team this fall. Taras Pitra - Jordan Spieth ($12,800)  Jordan Spieth at $12,800 is my favorite play this week for GPPs. Jordan was fighting a two way miss last week, and had a chance to win the tournament thru 54 holes.
528	528	3	4	negative	Taras Pitra - Jordan Spieth ($12,800)  Jordan Spieth at $12,800 is my favorite play this week for GPPs. Jordan was fighting a two way miss last week, and had a chance to win the tournament thru 54 holes. Whether you expected his contention or not last week, this is not the week to sleep on him as his elite ball striking and putting from 10-15 feet will allow him to convert a large number of birdies and keep him in contention throughout the weekend.
529	529	32	33	negative	In a sport in which Upside can be difficult to find, Vegas Bargain Rating represents a new and intriguing tool. This week, there is a lot of Upside in Spieth, Scott, and Matt Kuchar — more than is implied in their already-high DK salaries. Table The Greater  As promised, here is the table with all the golfers for this week’s D&D Invitational:
530	530	32	33	negative	Fades  Players to avoid and there’s plenty of them  Brant Snedeker: MC in three of his last four on Tour; hitting it everywhere and not putting up to his standards. Webb Simpson: 0-2 in two tries and didn’t fire on his home course last time out. Kevin Kisner: Last November’s win seems like 100 years ago, sadly.
531	531	20	20	negative	"Distance, Going for it Distance and Approaches over 200 yds."" As result the players with the worst course fit are: Cabrera, Marino, Vegas, Loupe, Henry and Summerhays. This is pretty much in line with most of the expert stat reviews, with one caveat."

The Memorial Tournament is very similar in stature and Tour scheduling placement to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

541	541	0	0	negative	Kuchar in the doubles 200/1. Four for the Memorial: Chappell 66/1, D Lee 100/1, Summerhays 200/1, Delaet (!)
542	542	67	68	negative	It demands extreme accuracy off the tee and a high-level of precision around the blazing fast greens, which average less than 5,000 square feet in size. Another solid showing for my picks last week at the Colonial, as Ryan Palmer rebounded for me in a big way in finishing t-3rd as my Lockzilla, and my hot streak with Hosel-Rocket BUST picks continued as I spot on nailed Keegan Bradley to miss the cut. Now, let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLAS (Last Week: Ryan Palmer t-3rd)    Dustin Johnson– The golfing world will be talking all about the big 3 this week, and rightfully so, but another world top 10 player cruises into Dublin this week in prime form, and I believe takes home the trophy.

DJ is in the midst of an extremely solid stretch, finishing 4th, t14th, t-5th, 3rd, t-4th, t-28th and t-12th in his past 7 events.
544	544	58	58	negative	Now, let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLAS (Last Week: Ryan Palmer t-3rd)    Dustin Johnson– The golfing world will be talking all about the big 3 this week, and rightfully so, but another world top 10 player cruises into Dublin this week in prime form, and I believe takes home the trophy. DJ is in the midst of an extremely solid stretch, finishing 4th, t14th, t-5th, 3rd, t-4th, t-28th and t-12th in his past 7 events. That t-28th was at the PLAYERS in which he played extremely well, other than a Saturday 77 when everyone not named Ken Duke shot high.
545	545	25	25	negative	That t-28th was at the PLAYERS in which he played extremely well, other than a Saturday 77 when everyone not named Ken Duke shot high. DJ absolutely feasts on par 5’s, and there are four of them that he’ll absolutely destroy this week. DJ is your victor this week.
546	546	0	0	negative	DJ absolutely feasts on par 5’s, and there are four of them that he’ll absolutely destroy this week. DJ is your victor this week. SEMI-FLIER (Last Week: Haas t-47th)    Marc Leishman– I was admittedly a little overly giddy with Leishman earlier in the season, but that’s not stopping me from remaining on board as he heats up.
547	547	34	43	negative	Also add in that he’s made six of seven cuts here at Memorial, including a t-5th last year and the Aussie is poised to bank another fat paycheck this week. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Keegan MC)    David Lingmerth– I would just take Keegan Bradley again in this spot this week, but that’d be just too easy. So, I’ll call for the defending champ to play his way into the weekend off.
548	548	26	26	negative	He’s always been extremely boom or bust, and there’ simply no reason to expect the former this week. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last Week: Kokrak t-55th)    Kevin Chappell– This soon-to-be 30-year-old is without question one of the best players on Tour sans a victory, and if he keeps playing like he has been of late, he’ll be adding to that trophy case sooner than later. In his past 7 events, he has a 2nd place at Bay Hill, t-9th at the RBC Heritage, t-4th at the Valero Texas Open and 2nd at the PLAYERS Championship.

552	552	1	2	negative	3. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar has the best record at Muirfield Village in the last five years of any player in the field. He's also on fire of late, including a pair of third-place finishes in his last five starts.
553	553	1	2	negative	8. Chris Kirk -- Kirk has a nice finish at Colonial in his title defense, continuing a string of solid play. He has a fourth-place finish here, which makes sense.
554	554	24	25	negative	Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Matt Kuchar - $9,900  2. Jason Dufner - $8,400  3.
555	555	6	7	negative	Jason Dufner - $8,400  3. Chris Kirk - $8,300  4. Daniel Berger - $7,800  5.
556	556	6	6	negative	Low Risk DraftKings Fantasy Lineup  Dustin Johnson (10,100): Johnson is having a very consistent season. He has made the cut in all 11 of his starts this year. He also has 9 top-25’s to his credit.
557	557	14	14	negative	He is still chasing that win, however. This is the type of course that DJ can excel at. He is going to be hitting shorter clubs in to these greens.
558	558	13	14	negative	He is an absolute stud this week and DraftKings knows what he’s worth. Matt Kuchar (9,900): I’m just going to keep riding Kuchar until he shows me otherwise. He posted his third straight top-10 last week in Fort Worth.
559	559	6	6	negative	High Risk DraftKings Fantasy Lineup  Rickie Fowler (10,300): Fowler has had a couple weeks off since his disappointing missed cut at THE PLAYERS. Before that, however, Fowler was having a pretty nice season with six top-10’s already and his DraftKings salary reflects that. His stats are all around superb, but I just want to see him get back to the good form he showed in the middle part of the year.
560	560	30	30	negative	His stats are all around superb, but I just want to see him get back to the good form he showed in the middle part of the year. This is Fowler’s type of course to possibly get his first win on the PGA TOUR. Phil Mickelson (9,100): After a great start to the year, Phil has sort of trailed off a bit.
561	561	3	4	negative	So does DraftKings. Kevin Kisner (8,600): Kisner has had a solid season, but most of his success was in the fall. His T-10 last week was his best finish since Hawaii.
562	562	34	35	negative	Graham DeLaet ($7,100), Ian Poulter ($6,700) and Stewart Cink ($6,400) are all listed in the DraftKings system, but have withdrawn.

564	564	0	1	negative	Matt Kuchar  What a week to play daily fantasy golf at DraftKings. The PGA Tour heads to Dublin, Ohio for the Memorial Tournament, and the field will be stacked with superstars to select for your teams. Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, the top three players in the world, will make the trip to Muirfield Village Golf Club, and all are coming off victories in their most recent events.
565	565	45	46	negative	All three will look to pick up even more momentum this week ahead of the US Open Championship in June. Many more big names will be in this week's Memorial Field, including Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed, Hideki Matsuyama, Phil Mickelson and Matt Kuchar. As always, there is plenty of great fantasy golf to play on DraftKings.

Instead, we're using two former champions as building blocks.
567	567	12	12	negative	Instead, we're using two former champions as building blocks. We begin with Kuchar who has made the cut at the Memorial all seven times since 2008 with five Top 10s, including a victory in 2013. The course was built for a steady player like Kuch who ranks in the top 26 on tour this season in four of the key stats we're weighing heavily.
568	568	29	29	negative	The course was built for a steady player like Kuch who ranks in the top 26 on tour this season in four of the key stats we're weighing heavily. Kuchar is in great form, too, with Top 6 finishes in each of his last three tournaments. We expect that trend to continue this week as he contends for his first win of the 2016 season.
569	569	0	1	negative	Ian Poulter is out at the Memorial and will be replaced by Jason Gore.
570	570	5	6	negative	Am I missing something with Wesley Bryan being 50/1? And yes I know he won 2 web dot com events.
571	571	39	40	negative	Yes, with the dearth of talent in the field, a 200/1 long shot can most definitely win; loading up on the top-end players wherever you can will prove to be the wisest Fantasy strategy, though. St. Jude Classic Picks  Dustin Johnson – DraftKings players still haven’t erased DJ’s crippling 2015 withdrawal from their minds yet, but it would be hard to argue he’s not the safest player in the field. The 2012 champ has yet to miss a cut this season, a run which has seen him finish inside the Top 20 all but twice in 12 starts.
572	572	32	33	negative	The flat stick is always going to be problematic, that’s a given; still, his tee-to-green game (28th), birdie rate (18th), accuracy from 150-175 yards (31st) will give him ample opportunity to contend. Colt Knost – Knost has played 18 events in the 2015-16 season, he’s missed just one cut. That screams safety, more so at a course where his deadly accuracy (2nd) will keep him out of danger.
573	573	22	23	negative	He could make some history this week as he goes for the 3-peat. This week the field includes Dustin Johnson (OWGR No.2), Brooks Koepka (No.9), Henrik Stenson (No.15) and Phil Mickelson (No.20) - all in all though, it's traditionally one of the weaker tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule, as many players take the opportunity to scout Shinnecock Hills the week before the U.S. Open. Clearly that presents a big opportunity for whose game fits TPC Southwind.
574	574	32	33	negative	You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Ben Crane, Harris English, Brian Gay, Brooks Koepka, Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Matt Jones and Chris Kirk.

577	577	45	46	negative	(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  As you'd expect with a smattering of elite players at the top of the market, the betting this week at the FedEx St Jude Classic is very stretched. With the past 2 U.S. Open champions in Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka at the head of affairs and perennial St Jude place filler Phil Mickelson also available at very short odds, it's difficult to spot value at the very top of the list. Instead, at an event where fancy prices win regularly, I'm on the hunt for some value.
578	578	26	27	negative	The three highest-priced golfers in the field are represented above, as well as Camilo Villegas, who we will dive into a bit later. $9,000 – $12,800  Dustin Johnson ($12,800) is the most expensive player in the field by $1,500, but his +$2,700 Salary Change from last week is well warranted, given the strength of this field. Dustin is playing incredible lately.
579	579	3	4	negative	$9,000 – $12,800  Dustin Johnson ($12,800) is the most expensive player in the field by $1,500, but his +$2,700 Salary Change from last week is well warranted, given the strength of this field. Dustin is playing incredible lately. Take a look at his field-best Recent Adjusted Round Score of 67.6.
580	580	36	36	negative	He hasn’t missed a cut all season and is coming off of a third-place finish at The Memorial, where he managed to hit 76.3 percent of his Greens in Regulation. Of course, we should remember that DJ withdrew last year with an ‘illness.’ I’m not sure of the medical term for his sickness, but I think it’s called “Starting bogey-bogey-bogey and making a mid-round decision to focus on the U.S Open.” I’m not a medical professional, but I wouldn’t be surprised this week to see a withdrawal by any of the projected U.S Open participants who get off to a cold start come down with an illness.

581	581	16	16	negative	Greens in Regulation, Salary Change, and other premium metrics are accessible via our free Ratings tool. Gary Woodland‘s ($10,400) Long-Term Driving Distance of 305.7 yards trails only Johnson’s in this range of salaries. Of course, finding the fairway with only 55.9 percent of those drives is cause for concern on a course with water hazards that swallow errant shots.
582	582	32	33	negative	For an unparalleled DFS edge, try our free Trends tool, where you can access our massive database of advanced data and leverage our premium exclusive metrics, such as Upside, Consistency, and Plus/Minus. Colt Knost ($9,700) has been a popular play for the past few weeks, but his most recent finish of 67th at the DEAN & DELUCA Invitational was his worst since missing the cut at the Valspar Championship in early March. Whether or not that drives down his ownership is a thought to chew on throughout the week, but the real question is whether or not he is regressing.
583	583	28	28	negative	Whether or not that drives down his ownership is a thought to chew on throughout the week, but the real question is whether or not he is regressing. Knost’s DFS appeal is due to his stellar accuracy, as shown in his Recent-Form GIR of 74.3 percent. Though his most recent finish isn’t one that breeds confidence, his accuracy didn’t falter.
584	584	6	6	negative	Low Risk DraftKings Fantasy Lineup  Dustin Johnson (12,800): Johnson is coming into this week as the heavy favorite. DJ has made all 12 cuts and has seven top-10’s already this year. After a solo third at Jack’s place, there is absolutely no reason this former FedEx St. Jude Classic winner shouldn’t be there on Sunday.
585	585	20	21	negative	Shelton tied for third at the 2015 Barbasol Championship; McCoy took outright fourth at this year’s Valspar Championship. They joined Jon Rahm (T5, 2015 WM Phoenix Open) as amateurs who have posted top fives in recent memory. (Incidentally, Rahm will play the Barbasol in five weeks.

The answer is – I have no clue.
587	587	9	9	negative	The answer is – I have no clue. But DJ has the best chance to run away with this tournament considering the strength of the field. He is absolutely killing it this season with six top 10s.
588	588	0	1	negative	David Toms $7,600  Odds To Win: 100-1  Expected Ownership: 8% He has solid course history here including a top 10 finish last year and a T3 in 2012. He ranks 40th in GIR% and is top 30 in SG:Around-The-Green.
589	589	9	10	negative	Three players to oppose towards top of #USOpen market. Mickelson Rose McIlroy . All underpriced and conditions won't suit them
590	590	23	24	negative	Tread lightly with Rose though as we still don’t know if he will come out with his his A-game after a long break. Henrik Stenson ($9,100) – As one of the most consistent golfers on Tour, Henrik Stenson makes perfect sense on a course where the winner will almost certainly be over par for the week. His tee to green game is elite and he is supremely accurate off the tee with his well-known hit 3-wood only approach to tee shots.
591	591	45	45	negative	With Rory’s recent propensity to put up rounds above par even on easier courses, I don’t think there will be enough birdies out there on Oakmont for Rory to storm back as he’s done in the past. “…Rickie has too much downside in my book” Rickie Fowler ($10,700) – Fowler’s proximity stats are even worse than McIlroy’s, which is one of the reasons I dislike Rickie on a course where accuracy is going to be key. We’ve also seen Rickie struggle recently having missed cuts at three of his last five events including back-to-back missed cuts in his last two starts.
592	592	8	8	negative	“…Rickie has too much downside in my book” Rickie Fowler ($10,700) – Fowler’s proximity stats are even worse than McIlroy’s, which is one of the reasons I dislike Rickie on a course where accuracy is going to be key. We’ve also seen Rickie struggle recently having missed cuts at three of his last five events including back-to-back missed cuts in his last two starts. If I’m going to be paying up in this high salary range I’m going to be looking for a golfer to have elite upside, and Rickie has too much downside in my book.
593	593	3	3	negative	We’ve also seen Rickie struggle recently having missed cuts at three of his last five events including back-to-back missed cuts in his last two starts. If I’m going to be paying up in this high salary range I’m going to be looking for a golfer to have elite upside, and Rickie has too much downside in my book. Phil Mickelson ($9,300) – It pains me to say that Mickelson is the player that concerns me most out of all the players I’m writing up.
594	594	33	34	negative	If I’m going to be paying up in this high salary range I’m going to be looking for a golfer to have elite upside, and Rickie has too much downside in my book. Phil Mickelson ($9,300) – It pains me to say that Mickelson is the player that concerns me most out of all the players I’m writing up. In 2007 we saw Phil miss the cut in what was the prime of his career.
595	595	0	1	negative	Phil Mickelson ($9,300) – It pains me to say that Mickelson is the player that concerns me most out of all the players I’m writing up. In 2007 we saw Phil miss the cut in what was the prime of his career. Since then his game has slipped back, and he has been prone to making big mistakes in key spots and taking big numbers on the score card as a result.
596	596	40	40	negative	Since then his game has slipped back, and he has been prone to making big mistakes in key spots and taking big numbers on the score card as a result. On a course as punishing as Oakmont, I don’t like Phil’s chances of staying out of trouble. Louis Oosthuizen ($8,200) – Louis Oosthuizen has missed back-to-back cuts, and at his price range there are several options I like much better than Louis.
597	597	17	18	negative	On a course as punishing as Oakmont, I don’t like Phil’s chances of staying out of trouble. Louis Oosthuizen ($8,200) – Louis Oosthuizen has missed back-to-back cuts, and at his price range there are several options I like much better than Louis. Sandwiched by Kuchar, Reed, Grace and Koepka there just isn’t a case that I can make for rostering Louis outside of the fact that his ownership percentage will be low.
598	598	18	18	negative	Sandwiched by Kuchar, Reed, Grace and Koepka there just isn’t a case that I can make for rostering Louis outside of the fact that his ownership percentage will be low. Despite his accuracy off the tee, Oosthuizen’s game hasn’t been great recently, and I’ll be looking elsewhere when building lineups. J.B. Holmes ($7,400) – J.B. Holmes is probably one of the more talented golfers in the $7k price range; however, it’s his driving accuracy that concerns me the most.
599	599	20	21	negative	Despite his accuracy off the tee, Oosthuizen’s game hasn’t been great recently, and I’ll be looking elsewhere when building lineups. J.B. Holmes ($7,400) – J.B. Holmes is probably one of the more talented golfers in the $7k price range; however, it’s his driving accuracy that concerns me the most. Obviously Holmes could fit into the same category as Bubba off the tee and may end up with shorter irons into the green; however, the difference in my mind is that Bubba’s approach proximity is one of the best in the field where as Holmes boasts one of the worst.
600	600	0	1	negative	J.B. Holmes ($7,400) – J.B. Holmes is probably one of the more talented golfers in the $7k price range; however, it’s his driving accuracy that concerns me the most. Obviously Holmes could fit into the same category as Bubba off the tee and may end up with shorter irons into the green; however, the difference in my mind is that Bubba’s approach proximity is one of the best in the field where as Holmes boasts one of the worst. Holmes just doesn’t have the skill set to take advantage of the added distance on a course this difficult, and for that reason I’ll be avoiding him this week.
601	601	1	1	negative	Obviously Holmes could fit into the same category as Bubba off the tee and may end up with shorter irons into the green; however, the difference in my mind is that Bubba’s approach proximity is one of the best in the field where as Holmes boasts one of the worst.

602	602	21	21	negative	Patience and mental composure will be just as important as skill when navigating this beast of a course. The Big Three (Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy) are the favorites, but there are many others who could shock the field if they attack the course wisely. As always, DraftKings is celebrating the Open with a Fantasy Golf Millionaire contest.
603	603	35	35	negative	There's not much to analyze here since that tournament took place nine years ago and many of the players in this field will be playing the course competitively for the first time. TOP-TIER PLAYS  Jason Day  World Rank: 1  DraftKings Price: $12,100  Vegas Odds to Win: 6/1  You really can't go wrong with any of the Big 3 as the anchor of your DraftKings team. But if we're paying up, we're going with Day.
604	604	3	3	negative	TOP-TIER PLAYS  Jason Day  World Rank: 1  DraftKings Price: $12,100  Vegas Odds to Win: 6/1  You really can't go wrong with any of the Big 3 as the anchor of your DraftKings team. But if we're paying up, we're going with Day. His recent form is outstanding; he has two wins this season and five Top 10s, including one at The Masters.
605	605	32	32	negative	And, of course, he has great length with all of his clubs, which will help tremendously on the long Par 3s and Par 5s. While he's never played a tournament at Oakmont, Day and his caddie spent some time on the track a decade ago with Day's agent, who is a member at Oakmont. Take that for what it's worth.
606	606	22	23	negative	S. Kjeldsen – 6400 * 7th in the Masters and a top 10 in Dubai, he can play in the big events. R. McIlroy – 12000 * While not playing great, his results have been solid for most. Always a threat.
607	607	1	2	negative	Fades  Rickie Fowler … While I was on board at THE PLAYERS, because I was on site that week and witnessed first-hand how much he was stretched in every direction as the defending champion, I wasn’t surprised that he missed the cut. It was reminiscent of his corporate responsibilities at the Farmers Insurance Open immediately after winning in Abu Dhabi. However, he then missed the cut at Memorial where he’s struggled before.
608	608	6	7	negative	You know exactly where you stand. Jim Furyk … In a phrase, not yet. His apologists have been working over the discussion beneath the Power Rankings, but the 46-year-old is still grinding back from surgery.
609	609	6	7	negative	Just 21 years of age, too. Bill Haas … While he’s now gone four straight starts without a top 40, this is just a reminder that he’s gone 26 starts in majors without a top 10. Now in his eighth appearance in the U.S. Open, it’s the only major in which he hasn’t registered a top 20.
610	610	24	25	negative	Not unlike Jordan Spieth, Walker’s profile is that of a scorer, but without enough recent success, Oakmont neutralizes that game plan like no other. Keegan Bradley … Rested and most likely rejuvenated following a T8 at Muirfield Village where he ranked 14th in strokes gained putting. The rub is that his best effort with the putter last season was also at Memorial.
611	611	2	3	negative	No thanks. Kevin Kisner … Unfortunately fulfilled the fade at Memorial in the wake of an out-of-nowhere T10 at Colonial where his putter was ablaze, but that remains his only top-35 finish in his last eight starts. Ryan Moore … Zero top 45s in both his last five stroke-play starts and last four appearances in the U.S. Open.
612	612	35	36	negative	Kevin Kisner … Unfortunately fulfilled the fade at Memorial in the wake of an out-of-nowhere T10 at Colonial where his putter was ablaze, but that remains his only top-35 finish in his last eight starts. Ryan Moore … Zero top 45s in both his last five stroke-play starts and last four appearances in the U.S. Open. Scott Piercy … The frequent cut-maker is just 1-for-4 at the U.S. Open where he hasn’t qualified since 2013.
613	613	21	22	negative	Ryan Moore … Zero top 45s in both his last five stroke-play starts and last four appearances in the U.S. Open. Scott Piercy … The frequent cut-maker is just 1-for-4 at the U.S. Open where he hasn’t qualified since 2013. He opened this season with top 25s in eight of his first 13 starts, but finished outside the top 65 in his last three.
614	614	39	39	negative	Driving accuracy doesn’t discriminate based on course; if a player hits 90-percent of fairways at Kapalua, that lends little context to how players will perform at Oakmont. It is a fine starting place, but doesn’t take into consideration that Jason Day will likely be hitting 2-Iron or Dustin Johnson will club down on holes where missing the fairway just isn’t an option. The rough isn’t the only hazard lurking off the freshly shaven carpet, either.

Even as the betting favorite, Day’s value doesn’t simply rest in his ability to win, it’s his ability to come inside the Top 15. At, what’s likely to be, the most difficult layout of the season, many good players are going to have disastrous weeks.
617	617	23	23	negative	At, what’s likely to be, the most difficult layout of the season, many good players are going to have disastrous weeks. It’s doubtful Day is one of those casualties. Bubba Watson – No, Bubba and the US Open don’t normally fuse for a successful golf reaction.
618	618	32	33	negative	Despite a string of poor recent finishes, most notably at THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP, Henrik pops up inside the Top 5 in overall SG: T2G and Driving Accuracy over the past three months. Rory McIlroy – Rory has the biggest blow up potential of any of the elite players, consistency isn’t really his bag, baby. However, in challenging conditions I have the most faith in Rory to remain in attack mode and actually try to score instead of playing for par.
619	619	0	1	negative	Rory McIlroy – Rory has the biggest blow up potential of any of the elite players, consistency isn’t really his bag, baby. However, in challenging conditions I have the most faith in Rory to remain in attack mode and actually try to score instead of playing for par. It’s going to be risky, and could lead to an embarrassing missed cut, but the upside of the world’s No.
620	620	19	19	negative	Willet is an excellent scrambler, crushes it Tee-to-Green, and clearly doesn’t crumble under the pressure of big moments. After Day and Jordan Spieth, there is no more confident 10-foot putter in the world than Willet. I’d imagine that skill is going to come in handy at Oakmont.
621	621	6	6	negative	High Risk DraftKings Fantasy Lineup  Rickie Fowler (10,700): Fowler just hasn’t been the same as of late. He is coming into this event off two straight missed cuts. While his recent form is concerning, his stats don’t lie.
622	622	10	10	negative	While his recent form is concerning, his stats don’t lie. Fowler is going to be a stud this week. He ranks 5th in strokes gained tee to green and I love his aggressive putting stroke in a major championship.
623	623	16	17	negative	A real threat this week at a very appetizing price and he can really putt too. Sergio Garcia 40% – We really want Sergio to win this thing. He has played the US Open 16 times now and has made 14 cuts with four Top 10’s.
624	624	13	13	negative	He’s 11th in SGTG and quietly on his game. WAVE 3  REMOVED Jordan Spieth 0% – It’s hard to knock Spieth in any way, as his worst finish in his last five majors was fourth place. That’s big time playing.
625	625	8	8	negative	He’s on fire as of late as well. Jason Day 30% – In his five U.S. Open starts, he has four Top 10’s, including two 2nd place finishes. 23rd in SGTG and a very solid putter.
626	626	4	4	negative	Just have to fade Day... No rain means no Rory, so hope it's dry. @NYCPunter Spieth doesn't seem right, and his putter will be neutralized.
627	627	128	129	negative	With nary a tree or water hazard in play, Oakmont might not seem visually violent upon first glance, but with deep bunkers, rough where you could lose a small child and greens where you could slip, fall and crack your head open if you’re not treading likely and yeah, it’s truly one of the toughest tests in all of golf. Now, let’s hop into some picks for the week:  LOCKZILLAS    Sergio Garcia– He’s all too easy to hate, but there’s no question about, he is so damn consistent. I almost wish he wouldn’t have won the Byron Nelson, as he really would’ve come into this week overlooked; however, it was three weeks ago and a lot has happened since then, but one thing remains: Sergio Garcia is one of the most consistent producers in major championship golf.
628	628	68	69	negative	Now, let’s hop into some picks for the week:  LOCKZILLAS    Sergio Garcia– He’s all too easy to hate, but there’s no question about, he is so damn consistent. I almost wish he wouldn’t have won the Byron Nelson, as he really would’ve come into this week overlooked; however, it was three weeks ago and a lot has happened since then, but one thing remains: Sergio Garcia is one of the most consistent producers in major championship golf. Yep, he has never won a major and may never do so, but notice this—in 16 U.S. Open appearances, he’s missed the cut just twice (once was actually at Oakmont here in ’07) and a whopping NINE of those went for top 25 finishes, with four of them going for top 10’s.
629	629	39	40	negative	He's playing solid golf coming in, and I think his demeanor is perfect for Oakmont, which will get under most everyone's else's skin. Top five in order: Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Matt Kuchar, Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker  Surprise prediction: Bubba Watson misses the cut. This might not be all that bold, even though Bubba is one of the world's best golfers.
630	630	16	17	negative	Top five in order: Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Matt Kuchar, Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker  Surprise prediction: Bubba Watson misses the cut. This might not be all that bold, even though Bubba is one of the world's best golfers. The U.S. Open simply doesn't set up well for his style and he can get extremely frustrated on the course.
631	631	17	18	negative	Ball striking is really the name of the game this week. Recent winners here include Justin Rose, Bill Haas, Tiger Woods, and Rory McIlroy (U.S. Open). That is elite ball-striking right there.
632	632	17	18	negative	Take a look at the Fantasy Golfanac for more course specifics and golfer quotes. Players to Watch    Rickie Fowler… Arrives with three straight MCs. There has been only one truly terrible round during that three-event stretch (opening round 75 at Memorial which lost 4.3 strokes to the field).
633	633	13	13	negative	No…play Finau. Patrick Reed… He’s not as devastating with his driver compared to Fowler, but his scrambling is what makes him attractive. On a long course like this, it gives you plenty of yardage to miss the green when you don’t have your A game.
634	634	11	12	negative	My Top 25 for the 2016 Quicken Loans National  1. Rickie Fowler  2. Tony Finau  3.
635	635	4	5	negative	Hudson Swafford  8. Bill Haas  9. Jim Furyk  10.

High End Targets ($9,000+)  Rickie Fowler  Vegas Odds - 14/1  Draftkings - $12,000  Fantasy Aces - $6,100  It has been a rough stretch for Rickie having missed three straight cuts at some big events(US Open, Memorial, PLAYERS). For this reason I would only recommend him for GPP's this week.
637	637	8	8	negative	2 bets for the QL: Kirk 60/1 and Henley 45/1
638	638	45	46	negative	Jason Kokrak: Finished T-3 in his only try in 2013 with all four rounds par or better; T-37 at Oakmont plus top 10’s at Riviera (T-2) and Harbour Town (T-9); makes his money off the tee. FADES  Players to avoid and there’s plenty of them  Rickie Fowler: Yep, he’ll contend and win again someday. I can’t lead with him, even in this field, but if he’s at the right price, he provides a nice hedge.
639	639	9	10	negative	So was his last top 35 (February at Riviera). Chris Kirk: Got hot, cooled off and this isn’t the course to get him or others back on track. Sung Kang: Backing up T-18 at Oakmont with another top finish this week would open my eyes even more.
640	640	25	26	negative	Unfortunately, the shuffling in the PGA schedule has moved the WGC Bridgestone up to next week, which has caused this field to be abnormally weak. Rickie Fowler, coming off of 3-straight missed cuts (starting with his Players title defense), headlines a very ho-hum field. Justin Rose, the most recent winner at Congressional, is still nursing an injury that has caused him to WD, so Bill Haas will come in as the reigning winner at this track.
641	641	27	28	negative	So without a lot of fire power to choose from, let’s talk chalk, good plays, and wise fades. Best High End Plays Tom: I actually do like Rickie Fowler this week – you just don’t expect a player of his caliber to keep missing cuts, and he is by far the best player in the field. However, when prices are so inflated that Marc Leishman (who has done virtually nothing this year) costs 10.9K, I will be looking at mid range lineups featuring golfers in the 7-10K range.
642	642	9	9	negative	I am absolutely stoked to watch Smylie, JT, and Rickie paired together, but just like what I said about Rickie last week, this game takes focus, and I think Smylie will be having too much fun, and to quote a famous professor, “true focus lies between serenity and rage.” Advertisements Don’t get me wrong. I’m not going to go so bold, as I’m saying Smylie Kaufman is my fade of the week.
643	643	14	23	negative	Greens are pure. So, yeah, that’s kind of the style I like to play.”  Jim Furyk… I backed off my initial love for Furyk last week when I dove deeper into his course history. The fact he finished inside the top 25 despite mediocre history is very good news.
644	644	18	18	negative	The fact he finished inside the top 25 despite mediocre history is very good news. I’m basically treating Furyk like normal again, and this week that means he’s an elite option. He’s posted top 10s in 10 of his 16 visits to this event.
645	645	8	8	negative	Hard to ignore that. Dustin Johnson… Much like Furyk, you can’t ignore his track record here, but it goes the other direction. In six trips, his best finish is 15th place.
646	646	28	28	negative	In six trips, his best finish is 15th place. IF he drives it like he has recently, he will beat that 15th place, but let’s not forget who DJ really is. He’s not accurate off the tee, despite what you saw for eight days at Oakmont and TPC Southwind.
647	647	4	5	negative	Justin Rose  2. Jim Furyk  3. Adam Scott  4.
648	648	35	36	negative	Shane Lowry is the defending champion of a 61-player field, somewhat depleted because the European Tour chose not to co-sanction the event this year in favor of supporting the 100th French Open. However, Dusitn Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Jason Day are the headliners this week. Here are our top five players for this week:  1.
649	649	1	2	negative	5. Jordan Spieth -- Spieth has been largely forgettable of late and was a total non-factor at Oakmont. However, he was in the top 10 here last year, and his relative lack of length shouldn't hurt him at Firestone.
650	650	12	13	negative	Look for him to keep his red hot form going this week. Hideki Matsuyama $9,300 Odds To Win: 30-1 Expected Ownership: 10%  If ever there was a time to get on Hideki while his ownership should be lower than normal, the time is now. Matsuyama is coming off two straight missed cuts so what better time to use him than at a no-cut event?
651	651	0	1	negative	Hideki Matsuyama $9,300 Odds To Win: 30-1 Expected Ownership: 10%  If ever there was a time to get on Hideki while his ownership should be lower than normal, the time is now. Matsuyama is coming off two straight missed cuts so what better time to use him than at a no-cut event? Matsuyama is still a very capable scorer and hits a ton of greens ranking in the top 25 this season in GIR %.
652	652	0	0	negative	Matsuyama is coming off two straight missed cuts so what better time to use him than at a no-cut event? Matsuyama is still a very capable scorer and hits a ton of greens ranking in the top 25 this season in GIR %. He is also top 5 in SG:T2G and SG:Approach.
653	653	1	3	negative	6. Jordan Spieth: Spieth struggled in his first trip to Firestone in 2014, but he improved considerably with a T-10 showing last year. He is just a few weeks removed from his win at Colonial and will likely have his game sharp in his lone non-major start in a seven-week stretch.
654	654	3	4	negative	Fairways and greens. Smylie Kaufman ($6,900): His wrist injury is a thing of the past as he's rattled off top 20s in two of his last three starts. He's making his course debut but his driver is his best weapon and Firestone will let him use it a lot.

This week I will enter the following lineup into the $3 Drive the Green contest.
656	656	16	17	negative	His game is always very fantasy friendly since he racks up birdies, eagles, and birdie streaks. Smylie Kaufman ($6,900): His wrist injury is a thing of the past as he's rattled off top 20s in two of his last three starts. He's making his course debut but his driver is his best weapon and Firestone will let him use it a lot.
657	657	27	28	negative	Grab anything better than 13/2 (7.50) for a Top20! For those seeking a value Top10 bet, and to extend my ‘american theme’, I recommend the uniquely talented Bubba Watson at anything better than 5/1 (6.00). He’s shown nothing in his previous Open starts; Troon surely offers him his best opportunity to date.
658	658	78	79	negative	Taking the strongest trends, the ideal fit for an Open champion at Troon is as follows:  - Has had a previous top 6 in an Open  - Is 35 or over  - In world's top 30  - Had a top 10 in either 2016 Masters or US Open  - An American who has already won in 2016    Does anyone fit the bill? Just one name comes through all those checks:    Brandt Snedeker - available to back at 55/1    The 35-year-old American, who sits 23rd in the world rankings, won at (very windy) Torrey Pines earlier this season. He finished T10 in The Masters and was T3 in the 2012 Open at Royal Lytham.
659	659	29	30	negative	Live coverage of the event itself begins at 6:30 on Thursday morning. Last 10 Open Winners  2015 - Zach Johnson -15 (playoff)  2014 - Rory McIlroy -17  2013 - Phil Mickelson -3  2012 - Ernie Els -7  2011 - Darren Clarke -5  2010 - Louis Oosthuizen -16  2009 - Stewart Cink -2 (playoff)  2008 - Padraig Harrington +3  2007 - Padraig Harrington -7 (playoff)  2006 - Tiger Woods -18      What Will it Take to Win The Open Championship? Looking at the result and the stats below from 2004, good driving was important here 12 years ago.
660	660	56	57	negative	It's also worth noting that the first three home all played the two par fives in seven-under-par, which also suggests that length will be key this week. 2004 Open Championship Top-Five  1 Todd Hamilton -10 DA T25 DD 10 GIR T19 TP T7  2 Ernie Els -10 DA T10 DD 4 GIR T6 TP 11  3 Phil Mickelson -9 DA T14 DD 15 GIR T23 TP T7  4 Lee Westwood -6 DA T33 DD 5 GIR T11 TP T33  T5 Thomas Levet -5 DA 2 DD 14 GIR T6 TP T18  T5 Davis Love III -5 DA T10 DD 9 GIR T13 TP T18  Stats Key  DA = Driving Accuracy  DD = Driving Distance  GIR = Greens In Regulation  TP = Total Putts    Although none of the last 10 editions were played at Royal Troon, the Open is always played on a traditional seaside links course so the test is very similar from year to year and an analysis of the stats should be useful, so here are the average rankings of the last 10 winners in all the key stats. Average key stats for the last 10 Open winners  Driving Accuracy - 27.9  Driving Distance - 29.8  G.I.R - 17.3  Scrambling - 19.5  Sand Saves - 36.3  Putting Average - 12.7    Last year's winner, Zach Johnson, ranked third for Driving Accuracy , second for Scrambling and fifth for Putting Average so that was why he finished up holding the Claret Jug.
661	661	55	56	negative	It was fast and firm in 1997 when Justin Leonard won here and I've read that Tiger Woods drove over 400 yards on the par five fourth hole and that he found the greenside bunker off the tee on the par four seventh. And I know he's won an Open now, but back in 2004 Phil Mickelson had no links form at all and yet the archetypical big bomber was beaten just a stroke here. Of course, there's more to Lefty's game than just power but I suspect that had a lot to do with his sudden high finish in a major he'd previously been flummoxed by.
662	662	99	99	negative	There'll be a school of thought that thinks a week or two off to recharge the batteries will have been the ideal preparation for what's bound to be a gruelling week at Troon but there's a strong possibility that this week's winner will have played in the Scottish Open last week given five of the last six Open Champions did. Louis Oosthuizen missed the cut at Loch Lomond in 2010 before scooting up at St. Andrews, both Darren Clarke and Ernie Els, the 2011 and 2012 winners, made the cut but finished down the field at Castle Stuart and Mickelson won there before doubling up at Muirfield. And in 2014, Rory McIlroy, having led at Royal Aberdeen after round one, finished 14th in the Scottish Open before winning at Hoylake.
663	663	12	12	negative	He'd finished 16th, ninth, sixth and 47th in his previous four Opens. Mickelson was playing in his 19th Open Championship when he won three years ago, Darren Clarke was playing in his 20th when he notched in 2011 and even greats like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy needed half a dozen event outings before they won it for the first time. Think very carefully before backing someone that's only played in the Open a couple of times and make sure you're getting a huge price about a debutant.
664	664	22	22	negative	Johnson was generally a [150.0] shot last year but he was matched at a high of [350.0] before the start. McIlroy and Mickelson were both well supported in 2014 and 2013 but Els was a [55.0] shot in 2012 and the three champions prior to the Big Easy all went off at in excess of [300.0]. And if we go back just a little bit further, both Curtis in 2003 and Hamilton here in 2004, were complete and utter rank outsiders.
665	665	38	39	negative	Bobby Jones (1926 and 1930), Gene Sarazen (1932), Ben Hogan (1953), Lee Trevino (1971), Tom Watson (1982) and Tiger Woods in 2000 have all won the US Open and the Open Championship in the same year. I've had Rickie Fowler in mind for this event for a very long time and he and Phil Mickelson were my ante-post picks way back in December. Fowler comes into the event under something of a cloud now though and he's considerably bigger than the 28/1 I took in January and Lefty's still available at the [60.0] I backed him at.
666	666	2	3	negative	I've had Rickie Fowler in mind for this event for a very long time and he and Phil Mickelson were my ante-post picks way back in December. Fowler comes into the event under something of a cloud now though and he's considerably bigger than the 28/1 I took in January and Lefty's still available at the [60.0] I backed him at. Henrik Stenson has drifted to a very attractive price given how many boxes he ticks.
667	667	80	80	negative	I'm not sure he has the mettle to finally win a major but at [40.0] I thought he could offer up a decent trade at least. With form figures reading MC-MC-T30-T23-T32-MC-MC, Bubba Watson's Open Championship portfolio is absolutely woeful but the 37-year-old American has the class to put that right - much like another mercurial left-hander did here in 2004. There are many comparisons that can be drawn between the pair of multiple Masters winners and I just wonder whether Bubba can emulate Phil and finally click in the world's biggest event.
668	668	54	54	negative	With form figures reading MC-MC-T30-T23-T32-MC-MC, Bubba Watson's Open Championship portfolio is absolutely woeful but the 37-year-old American has the class to put that right - much like another mercurial left-hander did here in 2004. There are many comparisons that can be drawn between the pair of multiple Masters winners and I just wonder whether Bubba can emulate Phil and finally click in the world's biggest event. I know his event form is a massive negative but there are plenty of positives with Bubba - including his price.
669	669	20	20	negative	There are many comparisons that can be drawn between the pair of multiple Masters winners and I just wonder whether Bubba can emulate Phil and finally click in the world's biggest event. I know his event form is a massive negative but there are plenty of positives with Bubba - including his price. The prolific world number five is a very long driver of the ball and he's already notched this season, at the Northern Trust Open in February.
670	670	36	37	negative	At [130.0], I thought he was worth a very small bet, despite the obvious lack of event form. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [11.0]  Rickie Fowler @ 28/1 (ante-post)  Henrik Stenson @ [40.0]  Phil Mickelson @ [60.0]  Bubba Watson @ [90.0]  Graeme McDowell @ [120.0]  Scott Piercy @ [130.0]    You can read the betting.betfair teams each-way tips for the 2016 Open Championship and I'll be back with the in-play blog on Thursday and over the next few days with a look at some of the side markets. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter

675	675	32	33	negative	Part 3 on Wednesday will look at golfers priced $9,000 and higher. Long-Term Metrics  Three of the last four Claret Jug winners can be found in the Mid-Priced Tier: Zach Johnson (2015), Phil Mickelson (2013) and Ernie Els (2012). Furthermore, Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk, Graeme McDowell, Martin Kaymer and Charl Schwartzel are additional Major Champions found in this pricing tier.

Furthermore, Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk, Graeme McDowell, Martin Kaymer and Charl Schwartzel are additional Major Champions found in this pricing tier. Adjusted Round Score: 68.6, Bubba Watson & Matt Kuchar  Watson and Kuchar are tied with an identical Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) of 68.6, the fourth-best mark in the field.
677	677	4	5	negative	Adjusted Round Score: 68.6, Bubba Watson & Matt Kuchar  Watson and Kuchar are tied with an identical Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) of 68.6, the fourth-best mark in the field. Watson’s 69.5 percent LT Greens in Regulation (GIR) is tied for 14th in the field, while his 312.1-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) is good enough for second overall. Watson is playing in his eighth Open Championship.
678	678	28	28	negative	Watson’s 69.5 percent LT Greens in Regulation (GIR) is tied for 14th in the field, while his 312.1-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) is good enough for second overall. Watson is playing in his eighth Open Championship. His best finish is T23 in 2012.
679	679	17	17	negative	He finished 10th at the Scottish Open last week. Birdies Per Tournament: 15.1, Hideki Matsuyama  The aforementioned Watson actually is the mid-priced LT Birdie king with a 15.4 average, but Matsuyama is right behind him with the ninth-best LT Birdie average in the field. In addition, Matsuyama’s 68.7 LT Adj Rd Score is tied for fifth in the field.
680	680	11	12	negative	His best finish is T7 in 2014. Odds To Win: 2.4%, Phil Mickelson  Mickelson’s current 2.4 percent Odds to Win are the best among mid-priced golfers and ninth-best in the field. Mickelson’s 69 LT Adj Rd Score is eighth in the field and his 14.1 LT Birdie Average is 16th overall.

Mickelson’s 69 LT Adj Rd Score is eighth in the field and his 14.1 LT Birdie Average is 16th overall.

684	684	21	22	negative	Bonus  Because it’s the MLB All-Star Break, so what the hell else are you going to read? Pro Trends: 9, Bubba Watson and Zach Johnson  Both players have been highlighted previously in this article and both come in with nine Pro Trends. Bubba’s most profitable Pro Trend is “Long-Term Driving Distance Score at Least 75,” historically good for a +2.48 Plus/Minus on DraftKings.
685	685	3	4	negative	Pro Trends: 9, Bubba Watson and Zach Johnson  Both players have been highlighted previously in this article and both come in with nine Pro Trends. Bubba’s most profitable Pro Trend is “Long-Term Driving Distance Score at Least 75,” historically good for a +2.48 Plus/Minus on DraftKings. Zach’s most profitable Pro Trend is “Long-Term Birdie Score at Least 65,” traditionally providing a +2.22 Plus/Minus on DraftKings.
686	686	28	29	negative	The 27 golfers in this week’s field of 156 were here in 2004. Fifteen made the cut, including the top four on the leaderboard (2nd: Ernie Els; 3rd: Phil Mickelson; 4th: Lee Westwood). Although Troon is officially 15 yards longer on the scorecard at 7,190 yards, returning competitors will find it to be similar in size and shape.
687	687	37	38	negative	I can’t ignore his rich vein of form in this event in recent years and given he made the cut here (42nd) some 12 years ago I think it is fair to say he has every chance. Phil Mickelson 45/1 (General)  Mickelson has enjoyed an excellent season which is missing just one thing at the moment – a win! He can change that here and I believe he is slightly overpriced given he is still very capable of hanging with the best.
688	688	4	4	negative	Lots asking me about Charl, not ideal but not worth jumping off entirely its not like the guy hasnt been practicing w them for 5-6 months.
689	689	38	41	negative	Known primarily as a cut-maker, I think his price may make him a very chalky play this week which is fine for cash games, but you may want to swerve when making your GPP lineups. Will Harris -- Charl Schwartzel, $7,800  Schwartzel is outside the top 20 in the DraftKings pecking order, but has the credentials of a fringe top-10 guy. The former Masters champ has been in fine, consistent form all year, picking up wins in his native South Africa and during the PGA Tour's Florida Swing, while cracking the top 25 in each of his past five starts.
690	690	39	39	negative	The former Masters champ has been in fine, consistent form all year, picking up wins in his native South Africa and during the PGA Tour's Florida Swing, while cracking the top 25 in each of his past five starts. Schwartzel is inside the top 10 on tour in a host of key stats, and though a rookie at Troon, he has solid history in Scotland. David Jayne -- Graeme McDowell, $7,500  When looking for a value play this week there are several factors I'm weighing heavily, and G-Mac grades well in all of them.
691	691	18	21	negative	At only $6,900 this week, I like his upside, especially for the Millionaire Maker contest. Zachary Turcotte -- Charl Schwartzel, $7,800  Schwartzel is the bargain of the week at $7,800. He has missed just one cut in 15 starts this season, has six top-10 finishes and three wins.
692	692	26	26	negative	He has missed just one cut in 15 starts this season, has six top-10 finishes and three wins. In his last six starts at The Open, Schwartzel has finished inside the top-16 four times. His tee-to-green game has been exceptional this year and his long iron play will help him with some of the longer par-3's and approach shots on the par-4 holes this week.
693	693	14	14	negative	If he can make enough birdies this week, he should find himself in contention. Schwartzel will be highly owned, but a must-play in cash games this week and worth owning even in the Millionaire Maker where ownership percentage is a less important variable than other weeks. Jason Rouslin -- Alexander Noren, $6,900  Well, the last time the Scottish Open was held at Castle Hill, the winner of that event went on to win The Open (Phil Mickelson).
694	694	20	21	negative	He’s an accurate, elite Par 4 scorer with Top 10s in each of his past two starts at Glen Abbey. Emiliano Grillo – Last year’s first round leader, enters with four T15s in his past five starts – his only blip was a T54 at Oakmont. Already a winner during the swing season, the Argentinian can certainly place the ball off the tee, sitting second on the year in total driving.
695	695	25	25	negative	Already a winner during the swing season, the Argentinian can certainly place the ball off the tee, sitting second on the year in total driving. Grillo also ranks in the Top 30 of greens in regulations, going for the green (hit green %), proximity from 50-100 yards, scrambling inside 10 yards, and efficiency from the Key Par 4 distance. He’s an ascending star who is going to breakthrough in a field with some star names soon, this could be the week.
696	696	0	1	negative	Roberto Castro 80-1 e/w... led field in SG: tee to green last week (barbasol), pretty decent par 5 scorer, 6th here in 2013
697	697	2	3	negative	Yet again, Kyle Reifers checks all the boxes for me this week (well, except for course history - but he did finish T20 at the Memorial)
698	698	23	24	negative	2 - Stewart Cink, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney. 1 - Keegan Bradley, Ken Duke, Ernie Els, Charley Hoffman, Billy Hurley III, Smylie Kaufman, Danny Lee, Hunter Mahan, Ben Martin, Troy Merritt, Geoff Ogilvy, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Ian Poulter, Chez Reavie, Rory Sabbatini, Vijay Singh, Scott Stallings, Jhonattan Vegas, Camilo Villegas, Boo Weekley. The RBC Canadian Open has been played here at Glen Abbey across the 2008, 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2016 renewals.
699	699	10	11	negative	Let’s see who I threw shade at this week. • Robert Garrigus– $8,300 he’s missed 3 out of 4 cuts here at Glen Abbey mixed with a relatively high price. No thanks.
700	700	3	4	negative	No thanks. • Kyle Reifers– $8,000 finished in 35th last week and is 0/2 here at Glen Abbey I’d much rather play Chad Campbell who has some good history here and also came in 35th last week. Oh and is 1200 less.
701	701	9	10	negative	Bold (notsobold for @RBCCanadianOpen ) fade of the week: Danny Lee. 71 in SGT, 111 in scoring avg. both stats that showed up.
702	702	8	8	negative	Also totally get why people are high on Hadwin, but use @FGMetrics average price tool for him. Similar to when Chappell was $9600
703	703	26	26	negative	If not, look for cheaper talent. Jon Rahm: One of those cheaper talents that you should be considering is Jon Rahm. Virtually unknown until this year, Rahm is priced at $8,600.
704	704	20	20	negative	Jon Rahm: One of those cheaper talents that you should be considering is Jon Rahm. Virtually unknown until this year, Rahm is priced at $8,600. He’s been unknown because up until a few weeks ago, he was an amateur.
705	705	26	27	negative	Andres Gonzales: T-12, MC and T-4 in his last three; T-22 here last year with rounds of 67 and 68 as highlights. FADES  Players to avoid  Graeme McDowell: Who can guess which week he’ll play well? Not me.
706	706	2	3	negative	Not me. Matthew Fitzpatrick: Since his win it’s been T-54, MC, MC and MC in his last four. Up next  Wednesday, I’ll present my gaming angles for the week so keep your eyes peeled at @GolfweekMag, @GolfweekFantasy and @MikeGlasscott for more information.
707	707	23	23	negative	Dustin Johnson  Day is the No. 1 golfer, but no one has been hotter on the PGA Tour this summer than Johnson. DJ won his first major at the U.S. Open after years of close calls, and he followed that with a victory at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational.
708	708	16	16	negative	1 golfer, but no one has been hotter on the PGA Tour this summer than Johnson. DJ won his first major at the U.S. Open after years of close calls, and he followed that with a victory at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational. He’s finished ninth or better in each of his last six starts, and there’s no reason why that number shouldn’t increase to seven this weekend.

Sign up here and receive A FREE ENTRY ($33) into the PGA Championship DraftKings Millionaire Maker Event  2016 PGA Championship Picks  Dustin Johnson – Spitting an abundance of HOT FIYA at the moment, DJ has posted six consecutive Top 10s, with a pair of wins, including his breakthrough at Oakmont. There’s no question he has the enough length (First in Driving Distance), but it’s his improved flat stick (34rd SG: Putting) and top grade from the key Par 4 range that push him above the other favorites.
710	710	9	10	negative	Looking at pricing for the PGA Championship, it appears Chris Kirk, Charley Hoffman, and Andy Sullivan somehow fell through the cracks.
711	711	30	31	negative	"Dave Tindall takes a close look at the make-up of the last 10 US PGA winners to see which player is most likely to lift the Wanamaker trophy in 2016...  ""Dustin Johnson won the US Open with -4 and has six wins on the PGA Tour with scores in single digits under par."" The majors always seem to come thick and fast over the summer and that feeling is even more exaggerated this year with the US PGA being brought forward to accommodate the Olympic Games. It means the year's final major takes place just a fortnight after the Open Championship."
712	712	7	8	negative	Those numbers would say not. By contrast, Dustin Johnson won the US Open with -4 and has six wins on the PGA Tour with scores in single digits under par. That includes his last three: -6 WGC-Bridgestone, -4 US Open, -9 WGC-Cadillac.
713	713	12	12	negative	That includes his last three: -6 WGC-Bridgestone, -4 US Open, -9 WGC-Cadillac. DJ can thrive in a tough test. Sergio Garcia won the 2008 Players Championship with -5 and the 2011 Andalucia Masters with -6.
714	714	56	56	negative	Sergio Garcia won the 2008 Players Championship with -5 and the 2011 Andalucia Masters with -6. He was also runner-up in the 2008 US PGA which Padraig Harrington won with -3 (Sergio shot -1) while, earlier this year, +3 gave him third spot in the Open de Espana at Valderrama (won with +1 by Andrew 'Beef' Johnson). Garcia, who was T23 at Baltusrol back in 2005, has the skills to thrive on grinding layouts and the trends are with him this week.
715	715	39	39	negative	Garcia, who was T23 at Baltusrol back in 2005, has the skills to thrive on grinding layouts and the trends are with him this week. All three 2016 majors have gone to players who had never won one (Willett, DJ, Stenson). Perhaps that's another good sign for Sergio.
716	716	1	2	negative	2. Rory McIlroy -- This is Major for Rory McIlroy. He's won two of his four majors here and has the best record in this major of the four.
717	717	1	2	negative	6. Henrik Stenson -- The Open champion also has an excellent PGA Championship record. He should fare well here because this is a ballstriker's track, but there's a reasonable worry of a hangover from the best major performance in history.
718	718	24	25	negative	Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Rory McIlroy - $11,400  2. Matt Kuchar - $8,600  3.
719	719	11	12	negative	Scroll To Bottom For PGA Championship Research Spreadsheet! Hot Course History:  Rory McIlroy ($11,400) – McIlroy makes a really interesting play this week with his history at PGA championships. He’s never missed a cut and in seven tries at the PGA Championship, he has finished outside the top twenty only once, and has two wins and four top three finishes since 2009 which makes Rory McIlroy the golfer with the hottest event history in the field.
720	720	3	4	negative	Hot Course History:  Rory McIlroy ($11,400) – McIlroy makes a really interesting play this week with his history at PGA championships. He’s never missed a cut and in seven tries at the PGA Championship, he has finished outside the top twenty only once, and has two wins and four top three finishes since 2009 which makes Rory McIlroy the golfer with the hottest event history in the field. Phil Mickelson ($10,200) – This may seem a bit obvious but with Phil Mickelson having been the previous winner in 2005, he certainly has winning upside here.
721	721	11	12	negative	Sergio is my underdog to win this week. Cold Recent Form:  Danny Willett ($8,200) – I’m going to leave Danny Willett in the cold recent form section because despite making the cut at The Open, his fifty-third place finish isn’t enough for me to think he’s off his cold streak. With Willett’s price dropping nearly $1,000 since The Open we don’t need him to perform quite as well to pay off, but a missed cut alone will certainly not do it and for that reason I’ll be off of Willett.
722	722	3	4	negative	Cold Recent Form:  Danny Willett ($8,200) – I’m going to leave Danny Willett in the cold recent form section because despite making the cut at The Open, his fifty-third place finish isn’t enough for me to think he’s off his cold streak.

Hideki Matsuyama ($8,800) – Rumor has it Matsuyama has been battling a hip injury which has led to his recent string of poor performances.
723	723	0	0	negative	Baddeley keeps coming up? Don't love it...anyone else feeling Bads post win?
724	724	21	21	negative	There are also 12 Par 4s on this course, so Par 4 scoring average will be very important. My Staples  Brooks Koepka – $11,200  Koepka is coming of an extremely gutsy performance, battling through an ankle injury at the PGA Championship. This storyline scared a bunch of people off of him, but his T4 showing proved he was well worth the risk.
725	725	32	32	negative	With no course history and suspect recent form, his ownership should remain low, but his results from last weekend were encouraging and I will be back all in on Henley. Automatic Fades  Bubba Watson – $12,300  Bubba will be super popular this week due to his course history and name value, but paying this much for a golfer with such poor form is tough to do. His average finish since The Players Championship is 45th.
726	726	11	12	negative	I need to see some consistency before buying back into Holmes. Charley Hoffman – $8,100  There has been a ton of talk about Hoffman this season and how good of a year he has been having. I just do not see it.
727	727	31	31	negative	He had a good run of golf back in April, but since then has one top 15 and a bunch of finishes outside the top 40. I won’t be paying for Hoffman’s subpar finishes this week. So you got burned?
728	728	6	6	negative	Wednesday morning thoughts for the Traveler's: MThompson's stats look great but his ch is abysmal. LDonald should be a thing. Casey&gt;Rahm?
729	729	12	13	negative	I fully expect Webb to challenge again at a course that suits. Jon Rahm ($9.800) – I don’t know what to expect from Rahm, but it’s clear that he’s an incredible talent. Having only played nine PGA tour events he has four top 10s.
730	730	22	23	negative	Likely to be highly owned, but I think time will tell that he should actually be a far higher price. To Note: Brooks Koepka ($11,200) – Last week I called him horribly wrong. While his ankle was apparently still giving him problems, he played fantastically through the pain.
731	731	8	9	negative	Expected to be low owned at this price. Ryan Moore ($7,800) – Moore hasn’t done much in the last few weeks, but he still has four made cuts in a row. These have been in high class fields (three majors and The Memorial) so may actually count for a bit more than meets the eye.
732	732	32	32	negative	These have been in high class fields (three majors and The Memorial) so may actually count for a bit more than meets the eye. The thing that makes this more interesting is Moore’s outstanding course form. Nine visits have resulted in five top seven finishes.
733	733	16	17	negative	At this price, it’s only sensible to continue to ride this hot streak until it ends. Daniel Summerhays ($7,600) – Another player with two top 10s at the majors this season, finishing 3rd at the PGA last week. Having burned a lot of people in Canada with a MC, he may be lower owned than expected.
734	734	20	21	negative	While he missed the cut here last year, he finished top 25 the year before including two rounds of 66. Jon Curran ($6,500) – Two weeks ago, Curran disappointed with a missed cut in Canada; however, he followed this up with his first ever made cut in a major. Having almost bagged a win at The Memorial, he has shown his game is in good shape.
735	735	37	38	negative	Follow me @happyhornet27 on twitter The Course: ADVERTISEMENT Held at TPC River Highlands, a Pete Dye designed par 70, winning scores have ranged between -12 and -20 over the past five years. Winners have varied between bombers (Bubba Watson), short hitters (Ken Duke) and all-rounders (Marc Leishman) over this period. Despite the variety, the stat that looks particularly important is greens in regulation – or strokes gained approach the green.
736	736	13	14	negative	In a confident mood I wouldn’t be surprised to see him challenging again. Chris Stroud ($6,300) – If there’s one person who loves the course, it’s Chris Stroud. In the last eight years he has made eight cuts including a top 10 last year and in 2013.
737	737	26	27	negative	With the Ryder Cup coming up, Donaldson – who holed the winning putt last time – may be inspired to make one final push. The Fade: Bubba Watson ($12,300) – Fading the best player in the field made me look stupid last week, but I’m about to do it again. Hopefully lightning won’t strike twice!
738	738	6	6	negative	Hopefully lightning won’t strike twice! While Watson has exceptional course form with two wins here, his recent form has been disappointing. Without a top 10 since before the Masters, Bubba would have to outperform his current play in order to meet his value.
739	739	1	1	negative	While Watson has exceptional course form with two wins here, his recent form has been disappointing. Without a top 10 since before the Masters, Bubba would have to outperform his current play in order to meet his value. I’m willing to take him on.
740	740	60	61	negative	His LT Adj Round Score of 68.7 trails only Bubba’s among players in this range of salaries, and his 28.8 LT Putts Per Round (PPR) is reason to believe that he can bounce back from his poor performance on the greens at the PGA Championship. It is likely that you have heard this question asked in the past weeks: “Is Jim Furyk ($9,400) back to form after returning from injury?” If you are unaware of the situation, here is a reminder: Furyk withdrew from the BMW Championship in September of 2015 with a wrist injury and later had surgery, which kept him away from the PGA Tour until he returned in May of this year to compete in the Wells Fargo Championship. He missed two of three cuts in May but has since made the cut in seven consecutive events, including a second-place finish at the U.S. Open.
741	741	32	32	negative	He missed two of three cuts in May but has since made the cut in seven consecutive events, including a second-place finish at the U.S. Open. This led me to believe that Furyk had returned to form, but returning to form and making cuts do not necessarily result in DFS value. The question now is whether he is providing the same DFS value that he provided before.
742	742	28	28	negative	I first took a look at his performances prior to surgery, which includes each event he played in the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 seasons. What I found was that Furyk had averaged +9.25 points above his salary-based expectations and met those expectations in 68.6 percent of his 35 events played. Next, I looked at the 10 events he has played in the 2015-2016 season (since returning from injury), and the results are far from those of his past.
743	743	24	25	negative	However, his six-straight made cuts, which include three major championships, warrant tournament consideration. If Watson is the king of course history this week, then Ryan Moore ($7,800) is the prince. Excluding players with only one recent appearance at this event, Moore’s 68.9 Course Adj Rd Score is the second-highest in the field.
744	744	11	12	negative	If Watson is the king of course history this week, then Ryan Moore ($7,800) is the prince. Excluding players with only one recent appearance at this event, Moore’s 68.9 Course Adj Rd Score is the second-highest in the field. He missed the cut in 2008 but made the cut in each of his next six appearances as well as finishing within the top 15 on five of those occasions.
745	745	62	74	negative	So is the two-time champ an obvious pick to play well? Joel Beall and I breakdown Bubba's chances, the rest of the field, and wrap up a wild week at Baltusrol in our weekly podcast:  And if you're more old-school and would rather just read my normal weekly picks, here's who I'm taking on my PGA Tour Fantasy Golf team in Hartford:  Paul Casey: A runner-up in his first trip to Hartford last year, Casey is coming off a T-10 at the PGA Championship. Wouldn't it be fun if he keeps playing well leading up to a Ryder Cup he's ineligible for ?
746	746	11	28	negative	2. OLYMPICS: Vegas makes Henrik Stenson, not Bubba, a huge favorite  Ryan Moore: With top 15s in five of his last six starts here, including three top fives, Moore is probably the safest play in the field. Well, if you forget about the fact he hasn't had a top 10 in a stroke-play event since March.
747	747	1	2	negative	lineup: Ryan Moore, Webb Simpson, Patrick Reed, Paul Casey (starters); Bubba Watson, Padraig Harrington, Luke Donald, Brendan Steele (bench). Knockout/One-and-done pick: Ryan Moore. Previously used: Kevin Chappell (Quicken Loans), Jason Day (PGA Championship), Bryson DeChambeau (Valero), Luke Donald (Valspar), Jason Dufner (RBC), Matt Every (Bay Hill), Tony Finau (Frys.com), Jim Furyk (Canadian), Sergio Garcia (Riviera), Bill Haas (Farmers), J.B. Holmes (Wells Fargo), Dustin Johnson (U.S. Open -- winner!
748	748	33	34	negative	(REMINDER: Playoffs’ events with cuts no longer employ a second cut of low 70 and ties after 54 holes if more than 78 survive the 36-hole cut.) Back to the here and now, Paul Casey states a good case as an alternative to Watson at the Travelers. Chris and Mark are on board, but don’t let that fact dissuade you.
749	749	11	11	negative	Looking to build on a good few weeks and gone for Casey, Woodland, Webb &amp; Finau this week at the #TravelersChamp
750	750	35	36	negative	I expect his ownership to be low, and his upside to be high this week which is a combination that should be well worth a shot at only a $6,200 price tag. Golfers I Like  Matt Kuchar ($10,600) – I really like Matt Kuchar this week in GPP formats, primarily because he is coming off only his third missed cut since 2013. As hopefully you know, Kuchar made the hate section of my article last week primarily because of his consistent underperformance in majors.
751	751	3	4	negative	Golfers I Like  Matt Kuchar ($10,600) – I really like Matt Kuchar this week in GPP formats, primarily because he is coming off only his third missed cut since 2013. As hopefully you know, Kuchar made the hate section of my article last week primarily because of his consistent underperformance in majors. However, we’re coming off the last major of the year in what will be a significantly weaker field.
752	752	21	21	negative	However, we’re coming off the last major of the year in what will be a significantly weaker field. And, as such, Kuchar should have very good top ten upside and high likelihood to make the cut as is typically the case from week-to-week. Jon Rahm ($9,800) – It may be surprising, but Rahm is actually underpriced when you compare his odds to his salary this week.
753	753	9	10	negative	At the top of that list is his perspective. Michael Johnson … Just a reminder that his solo third at the Barbasol Championship was on a course he knew maybe better than anyone else in the field. On that finish alone, he’d be eligible for the Web.com Tour Finals as he’d own a 14-point edge on idle Shane Bertsch at 201st.
754	754	9	9	negative	Good luck this week! DFS Fade of the Week  Zach Johnson  Vegas Odds - 8/1  Draftkings - $13,000  First of all, I want to make it clear that I don't think Zach is a bad play from a golf perspective. I mean look at his course history.
755	755	13	13	negative	It comes down to price for me this week. I just don't feel Zach is that much better of a play that he garners a a price $1,200 more than the next group. At this price he would not only need t win the tournament but possibly win by 2+ strokes.
756	756	14	14	negative	If you have to ask you can't afford one. High End Targets ($9,000+)  John Rahm  Vegas Odds - 17/1  Draftkings - $11,400  Rahm is coming into his own and will soon be a superstars on the PGA Tour. He is not a member yet but currently sits with 5 spots of the Top 125 on Tour which will earn him a bypass of the Web.com Tour as he would receive his Tour card for next season.
757	757	28	29	negative	If you’re a regular reader, you already know that I’ll extend my gratitude on occasion, but that you’re reading this page for the John Deere Classic in which Zach Johnson is scheduled to compete, your loyalty is unparalleled. Of course, I won’t rule out paranoia as a motivator. You just want to be absolutely sure that he’s the pick at TPC Deere Run.
758	758	25	25	negative	Because we use actual FedExCup points earned, which are quadrupled in the upcoming Playoffs, chasers can invest elsewhere and get away with it. Even if Johnson prevails at the JDC, I’ll tack on “only” 500 FedExCup points. A solo fourth in every Playoffs event is worth 540, so the guys in pursuit of me and not on ZJ are wishing for two things to happen.
759	759	42	42	negative	If you’re in an earnings-based game, play for the push. Obviously, only you know the intricacies of your pool, and I wouldn’t recommend the decision unless you truly have everything to gain, but when ranking obvious sites for every golfer all season, Johnson at TPC Deere Run probably ranks at the top. Let your competition make the unforced error.
760	760	1	3	negative	10. Hideki Matsuyama: Matsuyama hasn't played since a T-4 finish at the PGA Championship, but his reliable ball-striking makes him a threat at nearly any venue. While he has missed the cut each of the last two years at Sedgefield, Matsuyama did finish T-15 in his tournament debut back in 2013.
761	761	14	14	negative	While he has missed the cut each of the last two years at Sedgefield, Matsuyama did finish T-15 in his tournament debut back in 2013. Hideki Matsuyama: Matsuyama hasn't played since a T-4 finish at the PGA Championship, but his reliable ball-striking makes him a threat at nearly any venue. 10.
762	762	9	10	negative	Winning upside, but provides a nice floor as well. Patrick Reed… Defeated Spieth in a playoff here back in 2013 to secure his first TOUR title. Now heads straight from Rio to tee it up here to give back to the tournament that launched his career and also to pad his Ryder Cup points as he currently sits in eighth place, right on the bubble.
763	763	24	25	negative	Harris English… Loves to work the ball both ways, so these classical tracks that require shot-making usually set up well for the Georgia Bulldog. Rickie Fowler… Added this event to look for Ryder Cup points. Needs to make a good impression this week with his back against the wall.
764	764	8	8	negative	Theses guys want to earn their way on. Fowler earned the top spot in my rankings this week but I have to admit you could make a case for anyone from the top 15 below this week. Hideki Matsuyama… One of the top talents in the field, but it looks like we have poor course fit (and poor form) on our hands.
765	765	29	30	negative	Fowler earned the top spot in my rankings this week but I have to admit you could make a case for anyone from the top 15 below this week. Hideki Matsuyama… One of the top talents in the field, but it looks like we have poor course fit (and poor form) on our hands. He sees a decline in performance on par 70 courses, easy courses, and less-than-driver courses.
766	766	10	11	negative	My Top 25 for the 2016 Wyndham Championship  1. Rickie Fowler  2. Bill Haas  3.
767	767	4	5	negative	Jason Dufner  4. Patrick Reed  5. Kevin Na  6.
768	768	4	4	negative	I love me some #Norlander, but the day I ever pay over 6K for him will be never. I hope you all partake in Stenson lite this week.
769	769	11	21	negative	Fades  There’s always a few who won’t burn as bright. Hideki Matsuyama: Not sure how many tracks, if any, where Matsuyama has MC in consecutive years. This is one  Graeme McDowell: First-timer has MC in five of his last eight on Tour.
770	770	19	20	negative	Hideki Matsuyama: Not sure how many tracks, if any, where Matsuyama has MC in consecutive years. This is one  Graeme McDowell: First-timer has MC in five of his last eight on Tour. Shane Lowry: No weekends from his last three after T-2 at Oakmont followed by T-36 in his title defense at Akron.
771	771	17	18	negative	This is one  Graeme McDowell: First-timer has MC in five of his last eight on Tour. Shane Lowry: No weekends from his last three after T-2 at Oakmont followed by T-36 in his title defense at Akron. Brian Harman: He’s never had multiple top 10’s at any event plus he’s MC in four of five here since 2010.
772	772	21	22	negative	Shane Lowry: No weekends from his last three after T-2 at Oakmont followed by T-36 in his title defense at Akron. Brian Harman: He’s never had multiple top 10’s at any event plus he’s MC in four of five here since 2010. Harold Varner III: The local angle doesn’t change the fact that there are only two par fives on the course, and he’s a dire putter.
773	773	17	18	negative	These will be my only two bets this week. Other notables that came close include; Bill Haas, Bud Cauley and Harold Varner III. DraftKings selections  Moving on, here are my DraftKings selections.
774	774	23	24	negative	He will be looking to reproduce a week like that, after having last weekend off. One guy that needs a good week is Bud Cauley who currently ranks 143rd in the FedEx Cup standings. He needs to finish 4th or better this week to progress to the play-offs.
775	775	20	20	negative	In his four starts at the Wyndham Championship, he has missed his last two cuts after finishing 3rd and 52nd. Cauley may not finish 4th or higher as he needs to, but there is top 10/20 potential. Cauley who is playing on a medical exemption has finished inside the top-20 three times this season.
776	776	0	0	negative	Cauley may not finish 4th or higher as he needs to, but there is top 10/20 potential. Cauley who is playing on a medical exemption has finished inside the top-20 three times this season. Two of those were top-10’s, which came at the Byron Nelson Championship (4th) and the John Deere Classic (T8).
777	777	5	6	negative	As much as I liked Ryan Moore this week and last week, he's notoriously bad following a win. Not a single good showing.
778	778	0	1	negative	Hudson Swafford is 198th in SG Around the green. 67th or better in SG Off the Tee, Approach the Green &amp; Putting. That has to be correctable.
779	779	23	24	negative	There’s not many, but golfers with comparable LT metrics have historically generated a +7.60 Plus/Minus on DraftKings with 68.8 percent Consistency. Scrambling: 66.4%, Steve Stricker  Stricker’s 66.4 LT SC percentage is top of the field, as is his 28.1 LT PPR. His 69.4 LT Adj Rd Score is tied for 13th.
780	780	10	10	negative	His 69.4 LT Adj Rd Score is tied for 13th. Stricker has been enjoying a renaissance of sorts at the age of 49 during the second half of this season, as evidenced by his 68.3 Recent Adj Rd Score — 11th-best overall. He’s made nine of 10 cuts since February, during which time he’s enjoyed three top-10 finishes, including a fourth at The Open Championship.
781	781	23	23	negative	He’s made nine of 10 cuts since February, during which time he’s enjoyed three top-10 finishes, including a fourth at The Open Championship. Stricker finished T16 and T23 at the two U.S. Opens played at Bethpage, and he made the cut but finished 54th at the 2012 Barclays contested here.
782	782	20	20	negative	Opens played at Bethpage, and he made the cut but finished 54th at the 2012 Barclays contested here. At $7,100, Stricker is safe in all formats. Par 5 Adjusted Average Strokes: -7.2, Rory McIlroy  In 2012, the top-four finishers at The Barclays were all ranked inside the top 35 on Tour for Par 5 scoring average.
783	783	20	21	negative	With his accuracy off the tee and precision iron play, Stenson could be the man to beat here this week. Justin Rose 25/1  Rose comes to Bethpage this week after a superb performance in Rio bagging a gold medal for Team GB. He shot 67,69,65,67, to finish 16 under in total one stroke ahead of Swede Henrik Stenson.
784	784	24	24	negative	He shot 67,69,65,67, to finish 16 under in total one stroke ahead of Swede Henrik Stenson. Despite a back injury a few weeks ago, Rose looks to be back fit and healthy and has been in good form lately. He finished solo third at The Wells Fargo, T19 at The Players, T22 at The Open in Troon, T22 at The PGA in Baltusrol and an impressive win in Rio where he lead GIR for the week and putted superbly – two key traits for dealing with tricky Bethpage Black.
785	785	8	9	negative	Final Selections –  Henrik Stenson 2pts EW 12/1  Justin Rose 1pt EW 25/1  Brandt Snedeker 1pt EW 40/1  Branden Grace 1pt EW 45/1  Russell Knox 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 11 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter @Doublebogey63  Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Knox has performed well on tough courses this season and if he putts well he could have a decent chance here. He looks to have the game that could suit this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, second in GIR, 35th in scrambling and 19th in par 4 scoring.
786	786	29	30	negative	However, he’s still one of the best in terms of managing his misses which always brings him to the top of the pack whenever a tough track pops up. Rickie Fowler… Stood still at 12th last week on the Ryder Cup points list. This week is his final shot at securing a spot.
787	787	27	35	negative	On a site like DraftKings, you’ll be paying for consistency but you’ll need to rely on finishing bonus to make up for some lack of scoring firepower. Lucas Glover… Last week was the first time Glover ever popped for me statistically but I’m ready to quit while I’m ahead. Glover won here in 2009 but he’s failed to rack up a top 25 in his last 21 starts on bentgrass.
788	788	0	8	negative	Lucas Glover… Last week was the first time Glover ever popped for me statistically but I’m ready to quit while I’m ahead. Glover won here in 2009 but he’s failed to rack up a top 25 in his last 21 starts on bentgrass. I think he’ll be popular on DraftKings because of his round of 61 last week plus he’s a past winner.
789	789	19	19	negative	It always comes down to the flat stick, though. I think he makes for a great GPP pivot off Glover this week on DraftKings. Kevin Na… His wife is due in early September so he’ll be skipping the Deutsche Bank Championship.
790	790	4	5	negative	Bubba Watson  9. Rickie Fowler  10. Matt Kuchar  11.
791	791	4	5	negative	Rickie Fowler  10. Matt Kuchar  11. Charl Schwartzel  12.
792	792	9	10	negative	That combination will be key at Bethpage and beyond. Louis Oosthuizen … I know, I know, but if you’re chasing, he presents the above-average potential that you want and need. Great fit for Bethpage specifically where he tied for fifth in 2012.
793	793	11	12	negative	A quiet 2016 has nonetheless yielded 11 top 25s worldwide. Fades  Jimmy Walker … Pounced on a vulnerable Baltusrol, but won’t be as fortunate to experience a similar set of variables at Bethpage. A dry course with rough upwards of three-and-a-half inches and smaller greens feed the longer and straighter more than the longer and wayward.
794	794	23	24	negative	He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
795	795	22	23	negative	Touring professionals thrive on pressure, but the 27-year-old has been leaking enough oil on the greens to warrant concern as an investment. Zach Johnson … So, this is interesting. In his last six starts during which ShotLink was in use, he’s recorded positive strokes-gained numbers in putting to rise to 30th in the stat.
796	796	21	22	negative	Moreover, we shouldn’t have to think that his last birthday (the big 4-0) matters, but he’s not necessarily ruling that out. Justin Thomas … The 10-seed isn’t afraid of the moment, but weekly gamers wish he’d find it more often. Yes, expectations for a precocious talent are often misguided.
797	797	15	16	negative	I’m eyeing him for the BMW Championship in PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf driven by AVIS. J.B. Holmes … Seeded 38th to open the FedExCup Playoffs, but his more important rank in the short-term is ninth. That’s where the 34-year-old sits in the Ryder Cup standings with only The Barclays remaining before the top eight qualify automatically.
798	798	32	33	negative	After missing the cut at gettable Baltusrol, he connected on only one red number in his last four rounds, all on tracks that were rolling over – TPC River Highlands and Sedgefield. Brian Harman … There are gamers who will wonder why to include the lefty at all if I’m going to slot him in this section. It’s because he tied for fifth at Bethpage in 2012.
799	799	9	10	negative	Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Adam Scott – $9,500  I anticipate Phil Mickelson being a very popular play this week, and at $200 cheaper, Adam Scott will go more overlooked than he should. He ranks 1st in my weighted stat rankings, 1st in strokes gained T2G and dominate in the proximity stats.
800	800	19	19	negative	He is lacking the top finishes as of late, but he has won multiple times on tour this year. Scott comes in at a great price, likely low ownership and definitely has a chance of winning the first playoff event of the year. Branden Grace – $8,700  Are people aware that Branden Grace is even in this field?
801	801	11	11	negative	Shot link data visuals are updated, can see why I think Koepka's injury is bothering him.. has struggled off the tee https://t.co/4TplRvdzK7
802	802	1	2	negative	Fades  Justin Rose … For all intents and purposes, he matched up considerably better at Bethpage than he does at TPC Boston. Alas, in his first start with a gold medal, he finished T31 at The Barclays. And since Gil Hanse redesigned this week’s host track, the Englishman is just 3-for-7 with one top 50 (T16, 2013).
803	803	3	4	negative	Resist the temptation. Hideki Matsuyama … This capsule could take you in every direction and you wouldn’t argue along the entirety of the ride. The short story is that it’s golf.
804	804	15	16	negative	Sensible only for PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf driven by AVIS gamers because of the bench. Luke Donald … As the 53-seed, he’s a virtual lock to advance to the BMW Championship for the first time in three years, but a runner-up finish at Sedgefield already sets up as the anomaly in the long-term. It also doesn’t help matters that he was overlooked as a Captain’s Pick for the Ryder Cup.
805	805	7	8	negative	He hasn’t cracked the top 25 since. Bill Haas … The fact of the matter is that he’s failed to fulfill his projections too often since teasing us in March and at times since. In a vacuum, he looks great most weeks, but he’s exhausted so much trust among weekly gamers that they didn’t even need my approval to avoid.
806	806	8	9	negative	Approach him as you would a glass half-empty. Kevin Na … Withdrew on Wednesday. It was surprising that he appeared in the field at all because his first child was born on Monday.
807	807	20	21	negative	Even though his reasoning not to compete is the obvious priority, he can afford the week off as the 14-seed. Branden Grace … The expectation that the South African would showcase his skillset at Bethpage went unrequited as he missed the cut by five. That validated his MC at the Travelers three weeks prior.
808	808	1	29	negative	6. Dustin Johnson, United States -- After posting five consecutive finishes in the top 10, including victories in the U.S. Open at Oakmont and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone, Johnson has not been as sharp in his last two outings. He missed the cut in the PGA Championship after opening with a 77 at Baltusrol, and tied for 18th last week in the Barclays to open the playoffs, breaking 70 only when he shot 67 in the third round.
809	809	23	23	negative	Still, he is third in the FedEx Cup standings and leads the PGA Tour with 12 finishes in the top 10 this season. Johnson is making his seventh start in the Deutsche Bank Championship and his best results were ties for fourth in 2009, when he closed with a 66 to finish two shots behind winner Steve Stricker, and another tie for fourth in 2012. 7.
810	810	30	31	negative	He's come inside the top 25 in 75% of his starts here, and has the 2nd highest strokes gained tee to green average all time at TPC Boston (Via FGM). Brooks Koepka - DK Salary $8,700 - Rough week at the Barclays, but was still able to make 18 birdies. Top 40 in BoB% & P5S this season, and had back to back top 10's before the Barclays coming off of his ankle injury.
811	811	14	15	negative	There are so many other guys in this range I would rather pivot too. Jerry Kelly – $7,100  Old man Jerry at a birdefest? No thank you.
812	812	3	4	negative	No thank you. Jerry Kelly is 155th in birdie or better percentage, so it is shocking to see him have previous success at this course. I just do not see the upside in rostering Kelly at his higher than usual price tag, on a course that doesn’t seem to fit his game.
813	813	0	1	negative	Jerry Kelly is 155th in birdie or better percentage, so it is shocking to see him have previous success at this course. I just do not see the upside in rostering Kelly at his higher than usual price tag, on a course that doesn’t seem to fit his game. So you got burned?
814	814	3	4	negative	GPP flier only. Brooks Koepka – $8,700  Koepka was loved last week because of his recent form and relatively low price, but only managed to squeeze past the cut and finish 70th. For me, this will be a good time to jump back on Koepka, at a much lower price.
815	815	0	1	negative	Brooks Koepka – $8,700  Koepka was loved last week because of his recent form and relatively low price, but only managed to squeeze past the cut and finish 70th. For me, this will be a good time to jump back on Koepka, at a much lower price. My biggest scare for him last week was his injury and lack of motivation, but he played all four rounds, so any signs of a lingering injury are gone in my eyes.
816	816	33	33	negative	My biggest scare for him last week was his injury and lack of motivation, but he played all four rounds, so any signs of a lingering injury are gone in my eyes. Play Koepka with confidence this week. Hideki Matsuyama – $8,600  Oh Hideki, how dare you treat the DFS world that way?
817	817	16	17	negative	A win is long overdue but even a top 20 would more-than pay off this salary. Chez Reavie ($6,400) : We need some salary relief here and Reavie fits the bill. He owns a runner-up finish at TPC Boston and enjoys putting on bentgrass.
818	818	26	27	negative	ZJ has played here 10 times and posted top 30s in eight of them. SUPER SUBS  Patrick Reed, Brooks Koepka, Brandt Snedeker, J.B. Holmes      Group C  Louis Oosthuizen (8): The South African is boom-or-bust but that doesn't kill us in the Yahoo! format that allows us to bench a golfer after poor play.
819	819	11	11	negative	format that allows us to bench a golfer after poor play. Oosthuizen also has a runner-up at TPC Boston on his resume. Emiliano Grillo (8): Riding the hot hand here, despite no course history.
820	820	24	25	negative	Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end. Chez Reavie ($6,400): We need some salary relief here and Reavie fits the bill. He owns a runner-up finish at TPC Boston and enjoys putting on bentgrass.
821	821	20	21	negative	A win is long overdue but even a top 20 would more-than pay off this salary. Other Picks to Consider  Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100): One of the finest ball-strikers on TOUR, it will come down to his flat stick on whether he contends this week. Rickie Fowler ($10,000): Looking at the glass half-full, we can take a lot of good from last week's T7 at The Barclays.
822	822	8	9	negative	@gfienberg17 @ThePME Help needed... Either Brendan Steele or Chez Reavie this week?!? !
823	823	17	18	negative	He can save owners plenty of cap space in hopes of a return to form. Top Fades  Jim Furyk  Furyk's lack of length will likely hurt his chances this week, especially while being priced among the tour's longest drivers. He ranks just 164th in DD and 96th in P5S.
824	824	10	11	negative	He finished T37 when he won the FedExCup in 2010. Louis Oosthuizen  Oosthuizen hasn't had a top-10 finish since placing seventh at the Valspar Championship in March. Often priced among the field's elite players, the South African just hasn't been able to perform up to his requirements.
825	825	18	19	negative	He ranks in the bottom half of the field in average fantasy points, while having a top-tier salary. Branden Grace  Grace will make his debut at TPC Boston and the Deutsche Bank Championship, following up consecutive missed cuts in his past two events. His best rank in a key stat is an 11th in SGA, with his lone other top-100 rank being a 54th in DD.
826	826	16	17	negative	He knows the course from his Georgia Tech days like the back of his hand. Fade: Patrick Reed. He’s finished 19th and 27th the past two seasons, and didn’t break par a year ago.
827	827	10	11	negative	I don’t see him bringing home the $10 million bonus. Patrick Reed. He’s finished 19th and 27th the past two seasons, and didn’t break par a year ago.
828	828	10	10	negative	Seems like chalk? Players I will have no share of  Rory McIlory – $11,100  Personally, I will not be playing enough lineups to roster everyone, so fading Rory is the direction I am going this week. I just find myself in situations where I would rather pay up for Dustin Johnson or drop down to Jordan Spieth.
829	829	16	16	negative	He has won recently but his results that surround that win are too inconsistent for me. Gary Woodland – $7,800  I guess I will never understand the Gary Woodland love. At $7,800, I’d expect at least solid recent form or course history, but Woodland has neither.
830	830	0	0	negative	Gary Woodland – $7,800  I guess I will never understand the Gary Woodland love. At $7,800, I’d expect at least solid recent form or course history, but Woodland has neither. Woodland is a sporadic golfer who can sometimes put together a solid round of golf or two and sneak inside the top 20.
831	831	13	13	negative	At $7,800, I’d expect at least solid recent form or course history, but Woodland has neither. Woodland is a sporadic golfer who can sometimes put together a solid round of golf or two and sneak inside the top 20. I don’t see any winning potential from Woodland this week.
832	832	0	0	negative	Woodland is a sporadic golfer who can sometimes put together a solid round of golf or two and sneak inside the top 20. I don’t see any winning potential from Woodland this week. So you got burned?
833	833	31	32	negative	George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
834	834	21	22	negative	With all this mind, it is time to look at this event both from a betting and fantasy prospect. Betting selections  Jimmy Walker 50/1 (General)  Walker played terribly last week, no doubt about it, but the 2016 PGA Championship winner can make amends here. In seven efforts here, Walker has two top-10’s and a 12th, all of which came in his last four attempts.
835	835	2	3	negative	Betting selections  Jimmy Walker 50/1 (General)  Walker played terribly last week, no doubt about it, but the 2016 PGA Championship winner can make amends here. In seven efforts here, Walker has two top-10’s and a 12th, all of which came in his last four attempts. He has clearly got to grips with the course after missing his first three straight cuts between 2008-2010.
836	836	30	30	negative	He has clearly got to grips with the course after missing his first three straight cuts between 2008-2010. Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here.
837	837	12	12	negative	Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
838	838	19	19	negative	It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price. Walker also played poorly at East Lake which again is a factor. Before that though, Walker had finished T13 at the BMW Championship and 3rd at the Deutsche Bank Championship.
839	839	0	0	negative	Walker also played poorly at East Lake which again is a factor. Before that though, Walker had finished T13 at the BMW Championship and 3rd at the Deutsche Bank Championship. The odds are stacked against him but no more so than they were at the PGA Championship and look how well he played that week.
840	840	25	25	negative	The odds are stacked against him but no more so than they were at the PGA Championship and look how well he played that week. Walker had missed four of his last eight cuts going into the PGA Championship and won in dominating fashion. This pick is based on price.
841	841	16	17	negative	With a solid record here and decent current form Piercy could be worth a look here. Grayson Murray 55/1  This guy looks an incredible future prospect and comes to Vegas in superb form. He had a great finish to the Web.com Tour finishing solo seventh at The News Sentinal Open, solo third at The Albertsons Boise Open shooting a pair of 64’s in rounds 3 and 4 and a win at The Nationwide Children’s Hospital Open.
842	842	31	31	negative	He had a good start to his PGA Tour season with respectable T8 at The Sanderson Farms last week shooting 67,65 in the first two rounds. Last season on the web.com Murray was averaging just under 320 yards off the tee ranking fourth in driving distance. He also ranked fifth in putting average, third in par 4 scoring and first in par 5 scoring, all these stats bode well around here.
843	843	39	40	negative	Ishikawa looks to be in flying form and after playing well here twice before, he could another player to keep an eye on at generous odds. Final selections –  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 18/1  Scott Piercy 1pt EW 28/1  Grayson Murray 0.5pts EW 55/1  Ryo Ishikawa 0.5pts EW 70/1  Total staked = 6pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf.

844	844	1	2	negative	4. Jimmy Walker -- The PGA champion has a strong TPC Summerlin record, with three top-15 finishes in the last five years. There's a reason MGM sponsors the guy; he shows up in Vegas.
845	845	1	2	negative	9. Webb Simpson -- Simpson doesn't really seem like a fit with Vegas, but he is, as a former champion of this event. 10.
846	846	6	7	negative	Scott Piercy - $9,700  2. Jimmy Walker - $9,600  3. Patton Kizzire - $8,500  4.

848	848	13	14	negative	From a statistical standpoint, two of these players stand out above the rest. Brooks Koepka ($10,700) missed the cut at Silverado North Course two of the past three years with a top 5 in between, in his only three attempts. However, he is naturally a birdie maker and has his lone tour win on a desert course in Scottsdale.
849	849	19	19	negative	However, he is naturally a birdie maker and has his lone tour win on a desert course in Scottsdale. Koepka was 10th in eagle rate on the PGA Tour in 2016 and tees it up at a course where eagles are a recurring theme. TPC Summerlin has a couple of reachable par 5s and a drivable par 4, of which Smylie Kaufman eagled last year on his way to victory.
850	850	27	27	negative	TPC Summerlin has a couple of reachable par 5s and a drivable par 4, of which Smylie Kaufman eagled last year on his way to victory. Furthermore, Koepka was 5th in birdie rate, 13th in SG off-the-tee, and 20th in SG putting in 2016 making him far and away my favorite DraftKings play. Ideally, these missed cuts will cut down his ownership allowing for an elite GPP play.
851	851	23	23	negative	Based on the early coverage it seems like this may in fact be the case. Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust.
852	852	8	8	negative	Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.

Danny Lee ($6,700) is another player that meets the small sample course history criteria having missed the cut in all three appearances at TPC Summerlin from 2012-2014.
854	854	23	24	negative	The Italian often gives himself more looks to roll in par breakers than most of his competition, so he’s A+-rated insurance in DFS. Graeme McDowell … He’s making both his first appearance at TPC Summerlin and first start of the season. It could be nothing more than a primer for next week’s title defense at Mayakoba, but the 37-year-old is poised to have as much fun on this racetrack that he did en route to a T5 at Sedgefield in August.
855	855	21	22	negative	On a week when just finishing Low Vegas Resident is an accomplishment, I like Cejka to take it. Bob Harig -- Ryan Moore ($11,000)  The Las Vegas native returns home, and if he can get over the jet lag of being in Asia for two weeks, he should be quite comfortable at the Shriners tournament. He is ranked 32nd in the world after his playoff loss at the Tour Championship which led to a strong Ryder Cup performance.
856	856	33	34	negative	Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for your to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Ryan Moore. Since showing up at John Deere this summer (which he won), former UNLV standout has finished eighth or better in half of his starts.
857	857	7	8	negative	And pulled confidence from Ryder Cup, too. Ryan Moore. Since showing up at John Deere this summer (which he won), former UNLV standout has finished eighth or better in half of his starts.
858	858	12	13	negative	Capable of doing what Cody Gribble did in Jackson last week. Fade: Hunter Mahan. Struggled in Napa and not very close to striking it as consistently as he once did.
859	859	19	20	negative	All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year. Fade: Graeme McDowell. Actually played quite well in his last two events, both in Europe.
860	860	11	11	negative	Was T-22 at Safeway and T-36 last week in Vegas. Fade: Matt Every. Unfortunately, has made only one cut since the Tour departed Florida last March and has missed eight cuts in a row.
861	861	31	31	negative	This week, I’m going with Carlos Ortiz ($5,800), a Mexican native who is playing well under pressure right now; he just advanced to final stage of Web.com Tour Q-School. Fade: Angel Cabrera is cheap, yes, but look elsewhere for value options. Cabrera was last here a year ago and has made just four of his last 10 cuts with a best finish of T-37.
862	862	0	1	negative	Jim Furyk – $10,200  Just re-read what I put for Russell Knox and add 15 years to his age, then you have Jim Furyk. Furyk is elite off the tee and will find a ton of fairways this week. He has yet to play this course, but that hasn’t been a huge issue in the past, as a lot of winners at Mayakoba were seeing the course for the first time.
863	863	32	32	negative	He has yet to play this course, but that hasn’t been a huge issue in the past, as a lot of winners at Mayakoba were seeing the course for the first time. Furyk has won at Harbor Town and had some solid finishes at the end of his short 2016 season. He will be looking to get off to a good start in 2017 and I feel completely comfortable starting my cash game lineups off with Furyk and going from there.
864	864	0	0	negative	Furyk has won at Harbor Town and had some solid finishes at the end of his short 2016 season. He will be looking to get off to a good start in 2017 and I feel completely comfortable starting my cash game lineups off with Furyk and going from there. Derek Fathauer – $8,300  Fathauer has had an impressive run in the fall swing season.
865	865	27	27	negative	He is still one of the worst putters on tour and the variance of his outcomes this week in Mexico are greater than anyone else above $10,000. Gary Woodland – $8,600  This course sets up terribly for Gary Woodland. The grip-it and rip-it approach to Woodland’s game will only get him in trouble at this accuracy course.
866	866	0	0	negative	Gary Woodland – $8,600  This course sets up terribly for Gary Woodland. The grip-it and rip-it approach to Woodland’s game will only get him in trouble at this accuracy course. He was 144th in driving accuracy last year and 138th in hit fairway percentage.
867	867	22	22	negative	He was 144th in driving accuracy last year and 138th in hit fairway percentage. If the coastal winds pick up this week, Woodland could find himself in even more trouble. He was 5th last year in apex height and the wind could end up throwing his ball all over the place.
868	868	28	28	negative	He was 5th last year in apex height and the wind could end up throwing his ball all over the place. For me, there is a better chance Woodland makes the cut than finishes inside the top 20. Hard pass.
869	869	1	2	negative	7. Chris Kirk -- Kirk was in good position going into the weekend in Vegas, then laid an egg to stop a fourth-consecutive top-10 finish. Still, playing great overall.
870	870	24	25	negative	Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Chris Kirk - $9,600  2. Harris English - $9,500  3.
871	871	16	16	negative	Boegy Avoidance – Cejka, Fathauer, Peterson, Kelley, Hearn 3. Strokes Gained Putting – Gribble, Gay, English, Kirk, Chalmers, Hadwin 4. Birdie or Better % – Garrigus, Gribble, List, Cauley, Thompson, Cejka, Howell III 5.
872	872	4	5	negative	Walker missed the cut. Chris Kirk– $9,600 awful weekend, like so bad, I think that continues this week in Mexico. Avoid.
873	873	13	14	negative	At this price he looks a great low ownership GPP play. The Fade:  Scott Piercy ($9,800) – Piercy has played well recently, but having performed when almost 20% owned last week, I feel like he’s going to be heavily owned again. With this track more focused on accuracy, I’m not convinced he can perform as well this week.
874	874	4	5	negative	Webb Simpson  4. Chris Kirk  5. Russell Henley  6.
875	875	6	7	negative	I'm not sure if I'd back Chris Kirk at 14/1 to win my club championship.
876	876	5	6	negative	I’ll do better this week. Zach Johnson – $9,700 Even though he lives in the area, ZJ doesn’t have a top 10 on his card here in Georgia and he’s missed 2 cuts in 6 tries. It’s not a total fade but I feel like Web Simpson, Kisner, and Howell III are better plays.
877	877	26	27	negative	For the final pick, I'll go to the 60/1 mark. There are actually two players I looked at here - John Huh and the eventual selection Anirban Lahiri. Huh has been pretty solid throughout the Fall Series, reeling off finishes of 35-39-10-28.
878	878	30	30	negative	Add that to his T9 in this event last year and it's a simple case of course form + current form equalling decent appeal at that sort of price. But Lahiri is the one who could really take flight given his recent hot form. The Indian closed with seven straight birdies to finish runner-up in the Asian Tour's Macau Open last month and then took third spot at the co-sanctioned CIMB Classic in Malaysia.
879	879	19	19	negative	In fact, he added three more and an eagle on Sunday but a quadruple-bogey 9 derailed his title bid. Lahiri was also T14 going into the final round of last week's OHL Classic in Mexico before stalling but it seems a matter of time before his aggressive play gets him a win and I don't see why he can't get it at PGA Tour level. Of course, he is a proven winner on the Asian Tour (seven titles) and won twice on the European Tour in 2015.
880	880	25	25	negative	Of course, he is a proven winner on the Asian Tour (seven titles) and won twice on the European Tour in 2015. Also that year, Lahiri became the first Indian player to finish in the top five at a major when T5 at the US PGA Championship. It's his first start in this event but at least the 29-year-old has some good memories of Georgia having made the cut in both his appearances at The Masters.
881	881	43	43	negative	It's his first start in this event but at least the 29-year-old has some good memories of Georgia having made the cut in both his appearances at The Masters. Also T6 at the Colonial (another short par 70) this year, it's time for Lahiri to make the big leap. Finally, a quick mention of another local Zach Johnson.
882	882	18	18	negative	If you’re looking to be contrarian, Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson, or Si-Woo Kim may be your best bets. Furyk and Si-Woo were nothing short of disappointing last week and with little information about Si-Woo’s WD out there he is almost definitely going to come in at extremely low ownership. Zach Johnson has historically been bad at this event with three missed cuts in five tries and should fly under the radar.
883	883	29	29	negative	Vegas Odds Vs. Ownership Projections  William McGirt is another golfer who has been nothing short of disappointing which is typically a recipe for low ownership. That being said McGirt is 67:1 to win this event, is underpriced at only $8,100 and does have two top twenty finishes in three events, despite the fact that they were prior to the fall swing season.

919	919	22	23	positive	He is never a safe play (due to his putting) but he really ups his game when putting on familiar bermuda greens.

930	930	36	36	positive	He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.

Many will look at his finishing position and price and go elsewhere, but I don't think that's a wise move this week.
955	955	27	28	positive	He's not really a flashy name in the industry, but he's a strong, high-upside candidate this week and should primarily be considered for tournaments. Jeff Bergerson -- Hudson Swafford ($7,700)  One of the most difficult things to do in DFS golf is to get all six of your players through the cut, so when you can lock in a guy who has made 16 consecutive cuts, you do not hesitate.

960	960	19	19	positive	He's a solid ball striker with balance on length, accuracy and hitting greens. After missing the cut last week, Horschel comes at a nice discount, and in a field this soft, he's a strong bounce-back play this week. Jason Rouslin -- Stewart Cink ($6,900)  Stewart comes home to Sea Island Resort course off back-to-back 15th-place finishes.

963	963	26	27	positive	It won't take much to be over exposed if he is again under 10% owned. Also Consider - Bill Haas  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  John Huh  World Golf Ranking (221)  Vegas Odds (67/1)  Draftkings ($8,300)  FantasyAces ($5,150)    Believe it or not the #1 golfer in my overall model this week is John Huh. I haven't rostered him since early last season when he was playing his best golf of the year.
964	964	26	27	positive	This is great news for GPP's and I also believe there is enough safety here to use him in cash games, especially in head to heads. Anirban Lahiri  World Golf Ranking (78)  Vegas Odds (41/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FantasyAces ($5,150)    I am sticking with Lahiri this week who actually seen a price decrease of $300 after a T28 last week. He has been dynamite to start both tournaments this season with six rounds under 70 and could easily have a win and contended for another had he been able to close out on Sunday with a 72 in both tournaments.
965	965	20	21	positive	He is an excellent GPP play that becomes elite if his ownership stays in the 5% range. Also Consider - Robert Streb  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Michael Johnson  World Golf Ranking (592)  Vegas Odds (101/1)  Draftkings ($6,600)  FantasyAces ($3,500)    Who? Most will be unfamiliar with Johnson(I sure was) who made his pro debut in May after graduating from Auburn University.
966	966	21	22	positive	There is no safety in such a raw player but the the upside in these weaker fields events is definitely there. Xander Schauffele  World Golf Ranking (289)  Vegas Odds (126/1)  Draftkings ($6,200)  FantasyAces ($4,450)  With an expanded lower tier this week in a weaker field I am going to add a second pick down in this area. I am rolling with rookie Xander Schauffele is currently ranked #2 behind the red hot Cody Gribble.

Matt Kuchar- $7,000 A missed cut at his home in Sea Island Georgia, and two rather weak finishes here in the past, I don’t think Kuchar’s game is as good as the rest of the fields right now. He’ll be good for some birdies though if you do want to roster him.
1054	1054	20	21	positive	Will he just be turning up for a whack or could he shoot the lights out with no pressure on? Jordan Spieth - 11/2    Spieth won this by 10 shots when it was played at Isleworth in 2015, finishing 26 shots in front of last-placed Tiger. When defending at Albany, this week's venue, last year the two-time major winner shot rounds of 67-66-68-67 to finish solo fourth, five back from Bubba.
1055	1055	44	44	positive	The obvious negative is that he finished joint last here last year although he did get better each day (75-73-70-66). Henrik Stenson - 9/1    The newly-crowned European No.1 didn't play at Albany last year but he did finish runner-up (albeit by 10 shots to Spieth) in the 2015 edition in Florida. Stenson was also second at the WGC-HSBC Champions but didn't really have his best stuff when closing out the Money List title.
1056	1056	34	35	positive	That looked off when he was T54 in the WGC-HSBC on his most recent start a month ago but he tends to play the same venues well so we have to respect him here. Rickie Fowler - 16/1    Fowler jets in from Australia after he and Jimmy Walker finished runners-up at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne. The youngster admitted they didn't have their best stuff but it was still a strong performance.
