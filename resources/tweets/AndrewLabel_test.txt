1485	1507	7	7	positive	I'm e/w on Gallacher, Larrazabal, Que &amp; Meesawat (long shot) in HK. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
309	309	1	1	positive	On Spieth. When he won the TOUR Champs, week before had shot 65-66...72-70. Said his game felt very poor. He's the king of bounce back.
1213	1235	4	4	positive	Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Barclays:4 win D Johnson(10), 1ew Oosthuizen (60), 1ew Horschel (100), 1ew Matsuyama (30), 0.5ew Woodland (125)
722	744	5	5	positive	Another two European sleepers that nobody is talking about this week with top-15 upside: Ross Fisher and Matteo Manassero.
342	342	5	5	positive	Keep an eye on both Bubba and Rickie this week. Will be drastically underowned in both Yahoo and DFS games, but could both win. #theMemorial
444	451	3	3	positive	Game is feeling really good for Oakmont this week! Thanks to the Memphis fans, important work @StJude, and congrats to @DanielBerger59!
670	692	11	11	positive	Open picks Kaymer 50/1 Oosthuizen 50/1 Ante post Fowler 25/1 ðŸ˜³ grace 50/1 Kaymer 50/1 Els 150/1
1281	1303	8	8	neutral	Castro? Hmmm
650	672	14	14	positive	With the players added to DK pool, I think Manassero and Knost will get some traction. My favorite sleeper there is Richard Sterne ($5,900).
1013	1035	10	10	positive	@ThePME Toms and Campbell
