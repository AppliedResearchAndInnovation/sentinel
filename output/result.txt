Hughes has seven other top-25s, including two of his past three starts, and if the Tour Championship started today, he'd be in it, sitting 26th in points. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday.
Hughes  ->  positive

If he keeps up the same pace of improvement here, the Green Jacket is his and regardless of whether that looks likely or not, there is no denying his suitability with the course. Henley was defending his title at the Houston Open last week and whilst he was quiet on Friday and Saturday, Henley played well on Thursday (69) and Sunday (65) to finish a respectable T8, perfect preparation once again for this week. He will need to improve in keeping bogeys off his card, never ranking higher than 16th in that department in the three starts he’s made the weekend, but now making his fifth start at Augusta, he should have a better understanding of how to do just that.
Henley  ->  positive

Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin – Cash – DK: $6900 FD: $7600  Hadwin has cooled off from his great form we saw earlier in the season but he still lines up great for the course and does so at an affordable price. Hadwin lines up well for the par 70 track and does so at a reasonable price on DraftKings. Comparing his Vegas odds to his price point in the VIP PGA Spreadsheet we can see Hadwin is either mispriced by DraftKings or Vegas and I think I know which one is wrong.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past. At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago). Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead.
Hadley  ->  positive

This is a high risk/high reward GPP play as we should expect the return from injury to suppress ownership but we really do not know what to expect in terms of play. If Hideki is fully recovered than a $9700 price tag is simply absurd for a player with his talent and who should be under owned being priced next to Tiger  Francesco Molinari – DK Value – DK: $7300 FD: $9900  In his last four starts at this event Molinari has three top tens and no finish worse than T17. Although has not necessarily excelled this year a T25 finish at the WGC – Mexico Championship was a step in the right direction for Molinari.
Molinari  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month. Stenson is tied for fifth with his 68.4 LT Adj Rd Score and ranks fourth with his 15.8 LT Adj Bird Avg.
Stenson  ->  positive

FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12500 – Spieth’s unparalleled putting gets the headlines, but last year he was second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, a major ingredient to success at TPC Scottsdale. Spieth is obviously great at all aspects of the game and can win anywhere, but his combination of smarts and talent should net him his third top-10 finish in as many starts in Scottsdale this week. Hideki Matsuyama, $12400 – You may not find one person who is pessimistic on Matsuyama this week, as the Japanese star has finished no worse than fourth in four tries at TPC Scottsdale, including back-to-back playoff wins the past two years.
Spieth,  ->  positive

The greens are really old poa annua and the course is, it kind of has, almost has a slight links feel to it. Pebble Beach is my favourite, that’s my favourite course ever, but this course is in awesome shape and like I said, the weather is, this is as good as it gets in golf.”  Hadley ticks some key statistical boxes here ranking 37th in GIR, sixth in SGTTG, 37th in SG putting, first in par 3 scoring, 38th in par 4 scoring and 27th in par 5 scoring.

Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J. Choi, J.B. Holmes and Stewart Cink and you have an event that seems pretty accessible to almost everyone.

In addition of course it means we are getting 66-1 about a player who clearly loves the event and I’m happy to take a chance at that price that the return to La Quinta will reignite his game. DAVID LINGMERTH – 66-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 57th  Finally I will close my selections for this week by weighing in with David Lingmerth in this event for the third year running. I still wake up with the occasional nightmare about ‘Duf’s shot of the rocks here in 2016, which basically cost me a 66-1 winner on Lingmerth!
Lingmerth  ->  positive

Dustin Johnson (12/1) – A man who has really suffered after an amazing start to the year is World No.1, Dustin Johnson. Johnson was unlucky not to win the PGA Championship back in 2010, receiving a two-stroke penalty in the final-round, which cost him a place in the play-off with Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer. Six years on, Johnson finally got his first major win at the U.S. Open and he only looked forward from there.
Johnson  ->  positive

He is tied for 36th in this elite field with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score. Chappell’s 60.3 LT Driving Accuracy percentage should help him navigate this tight course, and his respectable 12.1 LT Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament (Adj Bird Avg) certainly won’t hurt him. Chappell is 1-1 in his attempts at The Open: He finished T53 last year at Royal Troon.
Chappell’s  ->  positive

He is a long shot, but we are certainly willing to take a shot at this low price.

Mastsuyama has been great at Riviera too: In three career starts he has never finished outside the top 25 and has posted 11th- and fourth-place finishes the past two years. Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice.
DJ:  ->  positive

Five players to consider adding to your team...  1 Patrick Reed £14.5M  2 Ryan Moore £9.5M  3 Emiliano Grillo £12M  4 Johnson Wagner £5.5M  5 Brandt Snedeker £14M Another option is Brandt Snedeker, despite being disappointing last week we believe he has what it takes to bounce back so make sure he is in your team is your and looking to take good points this week. The Texan finished fourth last year and is good value to have in your team this week.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

Softer conditions could favour bombers but in reality everyone is in play for the win here making this an intriguing venue for fantasy and betting purposes. Stud Picks  Bill Haas ($10,800): Haas has some tight competition at the top of the salary charts this week with Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson also playing decent golf, but Haas has been better than both recently. He recorded his best finish ever in a major at Erin Hills with a T5, and has four top 25 finishes now over his last four starts.
Haas  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Currently ranks 11th for that all-important Scrambling stat. Selections  Cameron Smith has impressed me greatly of late - in addition to his fifth last week, he also played really well in his penultimate start at the WGC Match Play - and so I've had a small bet on him and I've also played four outsiders...  William McGirt looked too big at [90.0], given his course form figures read MC-MC-MC-9-31-9-3 and I'm happy to chance the reigning Players champion, Si Woo Kim at a massive price. the RSM Classic winner, Austin Cook, is an interesting debutant at a big price and Kevin Streelman, who currently ranks third for Scrambling and second for GIR, was third here in 2013.
William McGirt  ->  positive

David Toms  ->  positive

Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week.
Rodgers  ->  positive

His monstrous 313.8-yard LT DD ranks second overall. Johnson has lit up Las Colinas previously with four top-10 finishes in his last six trips here and no finish worse than 20th in that stretch. His 68.5 Course Adj Rd Score is third in the field, which Johnson currently leads with 18.2 percent odds to win.
Johnson  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Ryan Moore 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  At the sharp end of the betting, Ryan Moore has plenty to play for this week with the Presidents Cup team announced in only 3 weeks time. At 18th in the current United States team standings, Moore must know that he needs to put his foot to the floor over the next 3 weeks to get into Steve Stricker's thinking, but a pot full of points from last season's Tour Championship at East Lake where he finished runner-up to Rory McIlroy in turn grabbing Davis Love III's last Ryder Cup spot, plus the 3rd at this year's Tournament of Champions at Kapalua and 9th at The Masters, means that the Nevada man is still in touch with the likes of Matt Kuchar and Charley Hoffman when it comes to automatic qualification. A win this week at a course where he grabbed his maiden PGA Tour victory in 2009 would be ever so sweet and it's certainly not beyond the realms of possibility.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Here's one last note that probably means nothing: Since 1965, there have been have only two non-U.S. winners of this tournament (but Graeme McDowell did win the 2010 U.S. Open at Pebble). DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Jordan Spieth - $12,000 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 8-1)    Spieth has not won this tournament, but he has two top-10s and two top-25s in his four visits. We surely need - and require - something better from the top price in the field.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Let’s jump into the picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama ($11,500/$11,400) – Look, I understand Jordan Spieth played out of his dome last week, and I have no doubt he could ship this week too. But to put DJ and Hideki at $1,100 and $1,200 below him this week is simply blasphemous.
Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Beau Hossler at 250/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  0.5pt e.w. John Peterson at 250/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  For details of advised bookmakers and each-way terms, visit our transparent tipping record  Regular readers who also follow golf's calendar closely, skip to paragraph eight for the hard stuff. For the rest, this week marks the start of the PGA Tour's stay on the west coast, and it's fairly low-key when set alongside the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship.
John Peterson  ->  positive

Off the course Palmer has been having massive problems with both his Wife’s and his own health but his tweet after his T58 in Hawaii suggests the stresses are getting easier. In a tweet this past Sunday, Palmer wrote “Happiest T58 I’ve ever had. After last two years, blessed to be back out with Jen getting healthy and myself being healthy.
Palmer  ->  positive

He was second at the high-class Open de France and fared respectably with top-25s on rare PGA Tour starts at the Houston Open and Memorial. A further angle with Uihlein is that his US residence is in Florida, suggesting he should be able to adapt to these greens. Note he was fifth on Bermuda at this year's Puerto Rico Open and also won in the Sunshine State as an amateur.
Uihlein  ->  positive

Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Last week he bounced back with a T6 at the Memorial fuelled by his best putting performance of the season as he gained 1.88 strokes putting on the field. If Stanley can transfer the confidence with the putter to TPC Southwind, then he must have an excellent opportunity of gaining his second tour win. Ranked 2nd on tour for GIRs and 12th in scoring average, he has the long game and results are starting to come with three top-10s since the start of April.
Stanley  ->  positive

To be in such good current form, he must be doing some things really well. In the stats of importance this week, Steele ranks 20th in Greens in Regulation, T22 in Par-4 Performance and T34 in Par-4 Scoring Average this season. In addition, Steele ranks 15th in the All-Around Ranking.
Steele  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7400): The third golfer this week is also a mid-priced option, which leaves lots of wiggle room to squeeze in an elite golfer without blowing over the salary cap; the 29-year old Stanley has had his coming-out party this year, sitting 38th in FedEx Cup points and three top-10s including a T4 at the PLAYERS. Going back to the fall swing season, Stanley has only missed two cuts (Honda and OHL Classic), and has been one of the best on Tour in terms of tee-to-green (5th) and Bogey Avoidance (12th). Where Stanley has struggled immensely is with the flatstick in hand, ranking 165th in SG: Putting, but he’s elite in almost every other factor on the way to the green.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

While I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s a world-class player, he’s definitely a few cuts above his competition here at a very good bargain price. Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events.
Robert Garrigus  ->  positive

That being said 35/1 with 6 places being paid is a big enough price for me to get involved this week with Matt who has finished 1st (2010 - Ridgewood), 2nd (2011 - Plainfield) and 5th (2014 - Ridgewood) at The Barclays in recent years. At 15th in the FedEx Cup, but more importantly 8th in the Presidents Cup qualification race, Kuchar knows that Reed, Hoffman, Harman and Dufner are all within striking distance of denying him from an automatic qualification spot. Clearly 5 into 3 spots doesn't go.
Hoffman,  ->  positive

Cameron Smith - $7,600 (30-1)    Here's a case of the odds not being in sync with the DraftKings price – the oddsmakers like Smith more, and that catches our eye. Smith was pretty active during the fall, as many Australians tend to be, and he's riding a streak of four straight top-five cashes. Smith played well at two PGA Tour events in Asia, then headed home and tied for fourth at the Australian Open before winning the Australian PGA.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

That his Consistency drops 10 percentage points with lower salary-based expectations is something to remember when Spieth tees it up with lower odds to win — but that’s probably not something to concern yourself with for the Master: At the time of writing, Spieth has 12.5 percent odds to win, the second-highest odds in the stacked Masters field. Last year Spieth had 12.5 percent odds to win and finished with a +21.86 Plus/Minus in the tournament. Current Form  In Spieth’s six most recent tournaments, he has averaged a monster 103.92 PPT with an amazing +24.54 Plus/Minus and incredible 80 percent Consistency.

Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He's the odds-on favorite to win this week and I can understand why. Statistically, Fowler has looked superb this year, ranking 4th in scrambling and gaining almost a stroke per round (over the last six weeks) from the strokes gained around the green. As we highlighted above, that metric combined with a hot putter will inevitably put Fowler in the top 10, with a chance to win come Sunday.
Fowler  ->  positive

MID TIER TARGET ($8K/$9K RANGE)  Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports  Gary Woodland ($8,000)  In this range, we dive right to the bottom where Gary Woodland sits as the lowest tagged golfer(8 tags, 3 start, 1 sit). Paul Casey, Jason Day, Louis Oosthuizen will command a ton of ownership and while Thomas is projected for around 10%, Woodland could be even lower. There is definitely some risk with Woodland as he ranks 89th out of 96 golfers in the field when looking at Strokes Gained: Putting on my sheet.
Thomas  ->  positive

He became the fourth player, alongside Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas to have won three times on the PGA Tour this season and I can see him winning again before the season is out. Rickie Fowler (18/1) – As mentioned above, Fowler is alongside or possibly now just behind Matsuyama in terms of “best player without a major” and he will be looking forward to playing at Quail Hollow this week, a course he has won at before (2012). As well as his win, Fowler also has a 4th (2016) and a 6th (2010 – his debut) at this course, so if he could have chosen a course to get his first major win, this may well be up there.
Fowler  ->  positive

You’re going to need to make birdies here and Sneds can light it up if his putter gets going early. Ryan Armour, $7400 – His price just continues to not make sense. Last 24 rounds, these all apply:  5 th in DK points  in DK points 4 th in SG: TOT  in SG: TOT 1 st in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 3rd in SG: Ball-Striking  What else do you want this guy to do??!?
Ryan Armour,  ->  positive

Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him. Cauley ranks 8th in approaches and had some success earlier in 2017 at corollary courses like Hilton Head and the TPC Stadium course.
Cauley  ->  positive

Johnson’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score is third, his 14.1 Adj Bird Avg ranks sixth, and his 28.6 LT Putts Per Round — a large part of Kisner’s win last year — is fifth. Johnson’s game should suit this track well, but he has some seriously shaky history here. He has missed the cut three of six times but also finished 12th and 16th.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

He did gain strokes on the field putting last week at the Wells Fargo, so that is definitely a good sign. Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday.
Scott  ->  positive

1pt each-way Brian Harman at 80/1 Paddy Power (7 places; 1/5 odds) Harman’s long game still needs some work but it’s starting to click into gear and already a PGA Tour winner, he could add to his tally this week. The 30-year-old has hit form in the last month with finishes of 13-MC-9-14 and is currently one of the best putters on tour, ranked 11th in strokes gained putting.
Harman  ->  positive

Steele finished the week just level-par on the long holes in 2017, which compared to Rose (-9) and Garcia (-7) was nowhere near good enough. Even Garcia and Rose were some way off the best in the field on the Par 5’s as Charl Schwartzel was 12-under-par. Steele has never finished inside the top-10 in a major which is an obvious negative, but he has been solid in recent years, at both the PGA Championship and U.S. Open, posting finishes of T12 (2015) and T13/T15 (2017/2016) in these events respectively.
Rose  ->  positive

Sweden's Henrik Stenson prepares to putt on the 5th hole on day three of the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links, Troon, Scotland, Saturday July 15, 2017. (Mark Runnacles/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)  IRVINE, Scotland (AP) — Henrik Stenson is pessimistic about his chances of successfully defending the British Open title at Royal Birkdale next week. The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again.
Henrik Stenson  ->  negative

Jason Dufner ($8,800): Dufner ruined several lineups for people last week with his weekend plunge. However, Dufner has a knack for this course as he is 6/6 for making cuts year in the last 6 years with 3 top 10 finishes. He also checks the box for us ranking 46th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 26th in BoB%.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Spieth  ->  positive

He may have found something in Mexico though as he gained strokes on the field putting in the final two rounds. With a ninth place finish at this event from last season to build on, Casey looks poised for a big week. I’m going out on a limb and saying Casey not only produces for DFS here but lands his second PGA Tour win as well.
Casey  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Chappell  ->  positive

Look for him to add a nice chunk to that total at a place where he lost a playoff to Jim Furyk in 2015. Adam Hadwin: The Canadian's breakthrough season continued with a T-36 in his Masters debut. Previously, he picked up his first PGA Tour win at the Valspar Championship, had a runner-up at Career Builder where he also shot 59 and more recently, .finished sixth place at Bay Hill.

It's also worth remembering that Harris has a 5th (2012) and 2nd (2016) to his name at Colonial and won the 2013 OHL Classic at El Camaleon - 2 courses where Lee has also finished 6th (Colonial 2017) and 3rd (El Camaleon 2014). English's altitude golf credentials are completed by a 4th earlier this season at TPC Summerlin in Las Vegas, a course where Jonas Blixt finished 3rd in 2012 prior to winning here in 2013. Result: T29  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 80/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  At a tournament where web.com graduates have had so much success, I'm keeping Ollie Schniederjans on side this week.
Harris  ->  positive

And while glowing praise around his achievements doesn't mean much in relation to this event, Cantlay would be a top-40 player in birdie average terms had he played enough rounds to qualify, and his no-weakness, all-round game seems ideally suited to a course which has thrown up all kinds of players. Cantlay shot 60 when playing in the Travelers Championship as an amateur back in 2011 so his adaptability and scoring prowess is not in question and he does actually have some experience of Conway Farms, having played in the Western Amateur here back in 2009. Video element not supported Cantlay's tee on No.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Whilst he is only 20/1, the positives outweigh the negatives here and he looks in good shape to contend for his first win of the season. Thorbjorn Olesen 100/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Thobjorn Olesen is a fantastic player, who despite winning four times already sometimes gets looked at as an underachiever. One thing for sure is that Olesen will be desperate to make the European Ryder Cup team, as his compatriot Bjorn is the captain this time around.
Thorbjorn Olesen  ->  positive

It is no surprise that Horsfield has been invited to this event given his huge potential and clear ties to the area and he will look to make good on this rare opportunity, after starting the season fairly well on the European Tour. Horsfield has twice qualified for the U.S. Open but missed the cut on both occasions, and whilst he has played a handful of times on the PGA Tour he is still yet to better his T48 finish at the RBC Candian Open, so why will it be different this week? Well after romping home to an eight-stroke victory at the final stage of Q-School after six gruelling rounds, it appeared Horsfield was finally ready to make the big step in the professional game and he has shown a few signs of doing just that since.
Horsfield  ->  positive

The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
Tiger Woods  ->  negative

I’ll ride him until he runs into the man below. John Rahm ($10,800): Last year’s runner-up here, Rahm went through most of the field like a buzzsaw in 2017 and should do so again this year. There’s not too much more to say as he’s my pick to win it all in a rematch with DJ.
Rahm  ->  positive

Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Dustin Johnson ($11,300)  So far, the Masters is the weakest major on his resume, but the course is built for a bomber like DJ, who should overpower the par 5s like Tiger in his prime. And that's who Johnson most resembles right now after winning his last three starts.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

BEAU HOSSLER – 150-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 2nd  For my final selection this week I am going to roll the dice again with a player who we were on earlier in the year in the form of Beau Hossler. Regular readers of my work will know that I picked Hossler as one of my players to follow for 2018 and on the West Coast swing he was certainly living up to the bill. As a native Californian it’s not surprising that Beau cooled off a bit once the tour reached Florida however I am hoping that a trip to his adopted home state of Texas will reignite things.
Hossler.  ->  positive

Perez, by the way, has a couple of top sevens at Innisbrook. Bryan, a three-time winner on the Web.com last year (the first two coming in late March and April), is a short hitter (167th Driving Distance), who does his best work on and around the greens (35th Scrambling, 7th Putts Per Round) so this place should be a good fit. Finally, I found an article on discoversouthcarolina.com about him and his brother George.
Perez,  ->  positive

Robert Garrigus ($6,600): Garrigus made my list last week as a low salary value play and he came through with a decent week; which included ranking 8th in SG: Approach. Garrigus generally has a good record at this event with only one missed cut in six attempts and comes in needing another good week here for FedEx cup purposes. With no price increase, and a weak field overall, we should continue to target him on DraftKings until the price goes up.
Garrigus  ->  positive

We all know it's coming and this week is a huge opportunity for the Georgia Tech product. RESULT: MC  Jhonattan Vegas 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  I'm always preaching patience so let's stick with Jhonattan Vegas for a further week on a course where he has a habit of playing well.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players as follows;  RORY SABBATINI – 25-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 43rd  This pick is purely about current form. I said after watching Sabbatini at the Valspar on Sunday a couple of weeks ago that I felt he would win soon and until he either does so, or his form dips, I want to keep him onside. Rory is the sort of player who can play well anywhere if he is on one of his rolls.
Sabbatini  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  You get the feeling that Rickie Fowler means business right now. 2017 saw Fowler play second fiddle to his Jupiter, Florida comrades Dustin Johnson (World Number 1), Brooks Koepka (World Number 8) and Justin Thomas (World Number 3) who between them amassed 11 victories last year including the U.S. Open, PGA Championship and 2 World Golf Championships. You can throw in a FedEx Cup title for good measure as well.
Fowler  ->  positive

If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play. Wagner is notorious for fast starts on Thursdays, and he was finally able to sustain that and post a top-5 finish last weekend. He also loves this course, making his past five cuts including an 11th and a runner-up finish.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

And I have been doing a fantastic job at that the last month or so, so you can't be too hard on yourself." On a layout where he shone last year, List can make another title surge. He's been in the top five for Driving Distance at this event in both 2016 and 2017 so loves to hit driver and he was ranked first for Scrambling last year so can chip well from these run-off areas around the greens.
List  ->  positive

Lucas Glover ($13,900) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %.
Glover  ->  positive

Retief Goosen $7.1 million - just ask yourself again. I personally have big doubts about Rickie Fowler at $9.5 million as well. Naturally he could explode into tournament wining form at any point, but Fowler 2017-style to date has been a pale impersonation of 2016-style where he had already finished 5th at Kapalua and won in Abu Dhabi.
Fowler  ->  negative

Spieth is currently 20th in Good Drive Percentage and performs well in Par 4 and Par 5 Scoring for the distances that TPC River Highlands features. Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

He’s definitely mispriced, even given his long-term marks: He has a superior LT Adj Rd score (68.4) than even Rickie Fowler (68.5), who is priced up at $10,600 on DraftKings. As usual, Casey should be the chalky mid-tier option of the week. Charley Hoffman lost last week in a playoff with Jhonattan Vegas but still had an impressive weekend, going 68 or lower in all four rounds at the RBC Canadian Open.
Casey  ->  positive

Of the past seven winners, all of them ranked inside the top twenty for the week in GIR percentage. Stud Picks  Jason Day ($10,800): Day has actually lost strokes to the field on his approach shots over six of his last eight rounds, but has still managed to pull off 15th and 2nd place finishes in his last two starts. To make a long story short, Day is killing it on and around the greens right now, something he did with regularity last year, but is lacking with his iron play.
Day  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

It would appear therefore that he is the sort of player who takes a momentum on to the next week and if he can do that here, when returning to a venue he has improved at every year, he could well surprise at a big price. ZACH JOHNSON – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 10 Finished 36th  The final place in this years team goes to another former Masters Champion in the form of Zach Johnson. Zach is winless since his memorable victory at St Andrews in 2015, however there have been signs since the end of last year that he is getting back on track.
ZACH JOHNSON  ->  positive

As with DJ, the encouragement for that comes from looking at this year's Bogey Avoidance stats where Fowler is ranked 4th (he makes one on just over 10% of his holes). Other very Augusta-friendly Strokes Gained stats from Fowler are 9th in Putting, 4th Tee-To-Green, 24th Driving Distance, 3rd Approach-The-Green, 1st Scoring Average, 1st Sand Save Percentage (nearly 80%) and 3rd Scrambling. If he can bring all those parts of his game to Augusta, he must have a golden chance of landing his first major.
Fowler  ->  positive

Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week. All of that being said, I’m not sure this is the week I want to attack Justin Thomas. On a course that is going to be a second shot course that requires good proximity and scrambling and some accuracy off the tee, I don’t know that this track favors JT enough to really want to dive head first into rostering him too heavily in GPPs.
JT  ->  negative

Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me. Ryan Moore 100/1 (Betfred & Skybet 6 places 1/4 odds, Betfair & PaddyPower 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  A disappointing season for Ryan Moore seems to be on the up of late, finishing inside the top-28 in each of his last three events. At the WGC Bridgestone Invitational Moore opened up with a round of 73 and it looked like his poor form would continue, however over the next three rounds he broke 70 in each and finished T28.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Jordan Spieth 2pts EW 16/1 with NEW OFFER! Bet £10 get £30 available via this link using promo code SPORTS60  TPC Boston is the perfect terrain for Predictor Number 1 Jordan Spieth. This is the venue where, in 2013, the Tour rookie shot a final round -9/62 - he finished birdie, birdie, eagle - to finish 4th and announce to Fred Couples that he was more than ready for a Captain's pick into the President's Cup team.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG. Perez has consistently been a great play on DraftKings, because he’s one of the best in the field at putting up birdies. He averages 4.16 (15th) per round, and is above-average on the par-4s (53rd), so although he has some warts he should find some success here.
Perez  ->  positive

Of course there have been changes made and like the rest of the field this will be new to him, but course form should still hold up to a certain extent this week, especially if a player is in form, which Fowler is. Fowler has five top-10’s in his last seven starts and also won the Honda Classic back in February, so it has been another memorable season for the young American. He needs to get a major win to really put himself at that next level and given how close he has come on numerous occasions, it would take a brave man to bet against him, each time he pegs it up at any one of the four.
Fowler  ->  positive

But it was at Muirfield Village where Watson really came to the fore for me this week. Rounds of 71-68-68 placed him in 3rd spot going into the final round and despite a 73 on Sunday, Watson held on for a morale-boosting season's best 6th place finish. 10th for Greens in Regulation, 13th for Putting Average, an eye-opening 11th for Strokes Gained Putting and joint tournament best -8 across the par-4s were keys to a strong result against the likes of Fowler, Thomas, Kisner and Spieth.
Watson  ->  positive

His stats are thrown off a bit from a rough final month in ’17, but a third place finish at the Tour Championship and a fourth at the RSM makes Kisner a nice guy to model your team around. Pat Perez, 8000: The veteran is fresh off a win in the swing season and is always a guy to roster early in the season. He came in third last year at the TOC and is 5-for-6 in cuts made at the Sony Open.
Pat Perez,  ->  positive

McIlroy is tied with Johnson atop the field with his 67.6 LT Adj Rd Score, and his massive, field-best 17.5 LT Adj Bird Avg makes him an elite play in DraftKings’ birdie-heavy scoring system every week. On FanDuel, McIlroy ranks behind only Johnson with 50.6 fantasy points per game in Rounds 3 and 4. We currently have McIlroy projected to be the chalk play of the week with 26-30 percent ownership in large-field tournaments.
Johnson  ->  positive

Ishikawa looks to be in flying form and after playing well here twice before, he could another player to keep an eye on at generous odds. Final selections –  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 18/1  Scott Piercy 1pt EW 28/1  Grayson Murray 0.5pts EW 55/1  Ryo Ishikawa 0.5pts EW 70/1  Total staked = 6pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf.

I will be looking at great wedge players and putters to fill my line up this week. Tournament History – Top 5 Players in the field over last 5 years  Player 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Jordan Spieth T3 1 – 2 – Dustin Johnson T6 T10 – T6 1 Hideki Matsuyama 2 – T3 – – Rickie Fowler – 5 – – T6 Justin Thomas 1 T21 – – –  Recent Form – Top 5 Players in the field over last 5 Tournaments  Player Hero RSM OHL Shriners WGC – HSBC Sanderson Farms Patton Kizzire – T45 1 T4 – T10 Rickie Fowler 1 – 2 – – – Austin Cook – 1 T50 T20 – T25 Ryan Armour – T37 T55 T20 – 1 Brian Harman – T4 – – 8 –  Key Stats  Birdie or Better % (BoB%) – Top 5  1 Marc Leishman 2 Justin Thomas 3 Ryan Armour 4 Brooks Koepka 5 Jon Rahm  Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G) – Top 5  1 Justin Thomas 2 Jordan Spieth 3 Dustin Johnson 4 Patrick Cantlay 5 Jon Rahm  Par 5 Scoring – Top 5  1 Marc Leishman 2 Xander Schauffele 3 Jon Rahm 4 Bryson DeChambeau 5 Ryan Armour  Par 4 Scoring 350-400 Yards – Top 5  1 Hudson Swafford 2 Wesley Bryan 3 Kevin Chappell 4 Justin Thomas 5 Brooks Koepka  This week I am going to focus on the lower salaried players as I believe Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler are all great plays. If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ.
Wesley  ->  positive

Fowler has performed close to or at his best since missing the cut at Torrey Pines, days after he'd flown in from a tiring title defence in Abu Dhabi, and several of his stats suggest the discovery of career-best form at just the right time. Fowler's short-game is especially strong at the moment - he's third in the PGA Tour's scrambling stats and is 28th in strokes-gained around the green - and he's putting with the same confidence he demonstrated when finishing inside the top-five at every major championship in 2014. Putting was certainly an issue last year - Fowler dipped from a top-35 putter to a mid-level one - and given that he's driving it well, flushing his irons and generally avoiding the sort of mistakes which used to ruin at least one of his four cards (fourth in bogey avoidance, a strength which was once a weakness), everything is in place for a breakthrough week at Augusta.
Fowler's  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bradley was first for greens in regulation at the Travelers so his irons were dialled in while he was third on the All-Around so did everything well. If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there.
Bradley's  ->  positive

This week the course is much tighter and more demanding. Spieth appears to be dialed in and prepared for a big year. Bob Harig: Jimmy Walker ($9,900)  Two of Walker's six career PGA Tour victories have come at the Sony Open and Hawaii definitely seems to agree with him.
Spieth  ->  positive

He caught the eye last week at Hilton Head when he finished fifth and I was happy enough to play him at [40.0]. Harris English put in a strange performance last week, playing brilliantly one day and awful the next but nobody bettered his six-under-par 65 on Sunday so I thought I'd chance him at a triple-figure price, given he's a former OHL Classic winner, and I've also thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned Aussie, Aaron Baddeley, at a huge price. Selections:  Billy Horschel @ [40.0]  Harris English @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [180.0]  I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play blog.
Aaron Baddeley,  ->  positive

Fowler is playing his superb T2G game with the confidence and poise of a soon-to-be major winner, and this event will provide him with a very nice warmup for Erin Hills next week. UPPER TIER  Phil Mickelson ($10,200) – There’s always a little concern over the “week before major” narrative with guys who are already qualified, but now that we know Phil will not be playing it, this event just got that much better for him. Phil has finished no worse than 11th in the past four years here with two runner-up finishes and a third.
Phil  ->  positive

From an altitude golf perspective, Sung has a great record at the web.com Utah Championship - finishing 2nd at Willow Creek Country Club (-17/271) in 2014 and 2nd at Thanks Giving Point Golf Club (-19/269) in 2015, with a top-7 at Boise confirming that he can handle approach distance mathematics. Kang also sits 65th in Strokes Gained Putting, 59th for Birdie Average and 1st for Total Birdies across the PGA Tour this season. Result: MC  Harris English 1pt EW 70/1 with NEW OFFER!
Kang  ->  positive

The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat. Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Ryan Moore 100/1 (Betfred & Skybet 6 places 1/4 odds, Betfair & PaddyPower 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  A disappointing season for Ryan Moore seems to be on the up of late, finishing inside the top-28 in each of his last three events. At the WGC Bridgestone Invitational Moore opened up with a round of 73 and it looked like his poor form would continue, however over the next three rounds he broke 70 in each and finished T28. Moore then went on to play at the US PGA Championship, opening with a pair of 71’s before shooting his worst round of the week, a 73 on Saturday.
Moore  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Tiger Woods $9,700 – It’s Tiger week! Eldrick Tont Woods makes his 2018 debut at a course where he’s won more times than the Patriots have Super Bowl rings. We’re excited.
Tiger  ->  negative

Here are a few players to consider from every price range. High-Priced  Jordan Spieth ($11,500) – A big part of the talk leading up to this year’s U.S. Open is the absolutely pristine condition of the greens at Erin Hills. They are already relatively straightforward greens to read, and while in some cases that levels the playing field a bit between the elite putters and the rest, it can also serve as the setting for an absolutely blistering round or two of putting to put someone like Spieth over the top.
Spieth  ->  positive

His price remains the same heading into this week and people are jumping ship after back-to-back missed cuts. With only 10 tags on FanShareSports (two of them being sit calls), Walker is flying under the radar in a field of subpar strength. Walker lost three strokes on the field last week around the green and his putter could not pick up the slack.
Walker  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Smith  ->  positive

Billy Hurley – GPP Punt – DK: $6200 FD: $5800  If you’re looking for a low 6K salary to fill out some rosters I think Billy Hurley is a viable option. Hurley has good recent course history with a T37 and T4 the last two years and showed his game returned a little with a made cut last week. Hurley has the best Vegas odds of anyone priced under $6300 and there’s good reason for that.
Billy  ->  positive

Webb Simpson  ->  positive

He was disappointing last week when finishing 48th but he was in fine fettle before that and he finished placed here for three years in-a-row between 2010 and 2012. Snedeker currently ranks 20th for Scrambling and he loks a decent price to bounce-back and contend again. Selections:  Patrick Reed @ 25/1 (Sportsbook)  Brandt Snedeker @ 50/1 (Sportsbook)  *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Snedeker  ->  positive

Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage. I prefer Haas over Webb this week due to a few stats.
Haas  ->  positive

He's a strong performer on difficult courses and a great putter. I think this is the year Noren makes a name for himself on the PGA Tour (as he's already done), and caps it off with top-10's in all majors. I think he's a great GPP play and could see using him in cash, but there are some better "on the surface" plays at cheaper price tags for cash games.
Noren  ->  positive

Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events. Paul Casey ($10,200) – People looking at Casey’s recent history here (43rd, MC) will be turned off, but he’s posted 13th and 5th place finishes previously at Colonial. When we’re targeting accurate ball-strikers, Casey pops to the top of our list.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week. Ian Poulter – Cash – DK: $8700 FD: $7400  Poulter continued his streak of good play at the Open Championship with a T14 finish. Poulter is among the elite in Shots Gained: Approach and Shots Gained: Scrambling this season which makes him a safe play and perfect for cash.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
Stricker  ->  positive

DJ had a 10-footer at 18 to win this tournament two years ago. He missed and then lost out in a play-off to John Hahn's 25-footer on the third extra hole. That was just Johnson's third tournament back after a six-month break for "personal challenges" and perhaps the competitive rust only really came out at the finish when he closed with a bogey-6 at 17 and a par at the last.
Johnson's  ->  positive

The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms. Jason Day has had a rocky start to 2017 with one top 10 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and a missed cut.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Koepka didn’t play here last year, but finished T26 on debut in 2014 before finishing 70th in 2015. Whilst it is a small sample size, an in-form Koepka should like the way this course sets up and hopefully that driver straightens out this week. Hudson Swafford 175/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Hudson Swafford broke his PGA Tour duck this season, winning the CareerBuilder Challenge but it has been anything but plain sailing since.
Koepka  ->  positive

If he can get the putter going he could be a big danger man here. Lucas Glover 33/1  Glover is another player that looks to be in fine form coming into this event with two top 5’s in his last three tournaments. After a missed cut at The Safeway, Glover bounced back with a T5 at The Sanderson Farms finishing on 15 under for the tournament and didn’t shoot worse than a 70.
Glover  ->  positive

Given a large number of those ahead of him in the betting will be using this as a warm up as opposed to going for the win, Henley arguably looks one of, if not the most obvious winner this week. Thomas Pieters 55/1 (MarathonBet, UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Whilst not in the finest form at the moment, Pieters looks an intriguing prospect on a course that he should be able to take advantage of. Pieters’ biggest strength is his length off the tee, but he is also a streaky putter and if he can find his touch on the greens, this test should suit.
Pieters  ->  positive

I pick my two guys near the top who I think will win, and pick & pray accordingly from the bottom on guys who fit the mold for this course (hello, Xander). That’s typically how I approach these.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Furyk, for instance, should have won both; Webb Simpson has lost a play-off for both; Chris Kirk and Heath Slocum have won the RSM and contended for the RBC, just like Kisner. Given that the RSM Classic remains in its infancy, the ties between leaderboards have been established rapidly and Kisner can become the first man to win both having recaptured his best form this year, including when going down by a single stroke in the Arnold Palmer Invitational last month. I thought he was unlucky at Bay Hill, even if as a backer at 66/1 I'd love to blame him for everything that went wrong.
Kisner.  ->  positive

He is the definition of a tee-to-green specialist, and should make good on his DFS nickname “Chalk Howell” this week – and for good reason. Harris English ($7,500) – Another rather generous price break for a guy who is basically the younger version of CH3, and a better putter at that as a bonus. English has never missed a cut here to go with three top-ten finishes and plenty of tee-to-green prowess to fit this course perfectly at a fine discount.
Harris English  ->  positive

With wins at Augusta and St. Andrews as well as contending last week at the 7,400 yard Firestone, it would be naïve to rule Johnson out based on the length of the course. After a very slow start to the season, Johnson looks to have picked it up when it matters most, heading into the business-end of the season. In his last three starts he has finished 5th (John Deere Classic), 14th (Open Championship) and 2nd last week at the Bridgestone, so he has got it rolling once again.
Johnson  ->  positive

Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

ADVERTISEMENT  Jordan Spieth who won at Pebble Beach this past weekend is joined by; World No.1 Jason Day, Dustin Johnson (#3), Hideki Matsuyama (#5), Adam Scott (#7), Justin Thomas (#8), Sergio Garcia (#9) and Patrick Reed (#10). Three of these players (Spieth, Matsuyama and Garcia) are coming off wins in their last starts. Garcia won the Dubai Desert Classic two weeks ago, going wire-to-wire to beat Henrik Stenson by three strokes, whilst Matsuyama overcame the challenge of Webb Simpson in a play-off, to win the Phoenix Open.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

BARGAIN BIN  Charles Howell III ($7,000) – Finally, a warm welcome back to one of my favorite golfers on tour! Chalk Howell III is back, and although he will undoubtedly not be very chalky this week as he’s returning from layoff due to a rib injury, he’s still one of the most versatile T2G players out there for a discount price, particularly in this field. Most importantly, however, he’s highly unlikely to miss that cut for you.
Howell III  ->  positive

Steele set for improvement  Back Brendan Steele for a Top 30 Finish 6u @ 11/5  Back Adam Hadwin for a Top 30 Finish 6u @ 2/1  Similar comments apply to this pair. Steele's stellar long game should be perfect for tough, championship courses and explain why he's finished top-15 in the last two US Opens. I doubt his short game is good enough to challenge at Augusta but 27th last year was no disgrace on only his second visit.
Steele  ->  positive

Paul Casey: One of the top golfers in the CSURAM88 Model, Casey is second and fourth with a 63.3 percent LT SC mark and 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall.
Casey:  ->  positive

Lower Tier  Luke List ($7600) (Finished 29th here last year)  JJ Spaun ($7800)  Anirban Lahiri ($7300)  Sung Kang ($7400)  Nick Watney ($7500)  Martin Laird ($7700)  GPP wild cards with upside  Daniel Summerhays ($7000)  Freddie Jacobson ($6500)  Shawn Stefani ($6100)  Kevin Tway ($6000) I like him for his course history and the fact he ranks 4th in Bogey Avoidance for a course that could potentially see the winner in single digits under par. (Patrick Reed $9700 and Zach Johnson $9300 have worse odds to win it all than Billy does).
Daniel Summerhays  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Really, a stunner. Yes, Spieth was horrible in missing the cut last week at Phoenix. But his track record here is exemplary, with three top-10s and five top-25s in five visits.
Spieth  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin – $7,600  Adam Hadwin was heavily owned last week, and even though he didn’t miss the cut, he certainly didn’t win anyone money. Hadwin only has six tags on FanShareSports, clearly showing people have already moved on. Let’s not forget Hadwin is still playing the best golf of his life and easily turn things around in preparation for his first US Open.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Weekley is 60th on Tour in GIR and T35 in proximity, so he does have the right game for Harbour Town. Zac Blair - $6,500 (Field, 5-2)    If all PGA Tour courses were short, Blair would be having a much better career. He's made 11-of-15 cuts this season and is coming off his best showing, a T8 at Houston.
Zac Blair  ->  positive

Broadening the TifEagle link out slightly, excellent performances on the pure TifEagle greens featured at Kapalua, PGA National, Doral and Bay Hill (from 2016 onwards) link in perfectly as well. My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Brian Harman has a decent enough record here and we know that the 33/1-40/1 price point is a sweet spot for previous RBC Heritage winners.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor. If you are going to tell me Brown is likely going to be highly owned at $9,800 when there are numerous options priced above and below him that are in better form, I will gladly fade Brown. Tyron Van Aswegen – $8,200  The price on Tyron Van Aswegen just doesn’t line up for me this week, even with the subpar field.
Brown  ->  negative

With a very reasonable price given his recent form and the tournament field, Reavie makes for a great cash game play. Given his recent string of made cuts, this is likely to make Reavie a highly owned player. Although he finished inside of the top 25 over half of his recent appearances he has only finished inside of the top five once.
Reavie  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned. Spieth has played Pebble Beach five times, finishing 22nd, 4th, 7th, 21st, and 1st a year ago.
Spieth  ->  positive

Stay away from Si Woo this week and thank me later. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Smith MC)    Billy Horschel– At 28th in the Ryder Cup Standings, Billy Ho needs a serious late push to join the Team USA squad at Hazeltine in a few weeks. Last week’s t-5th at the Wyndham Championship was a step in the right direction, and I expect for “Ho’s Mo” to continue this week as he makes his debut at Bethpage.
Horschel–  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($9,500 | 16) - Fowler's distance (46th in his past 24 rounds) and off-the-tee play (54th) isn't what you're looking for here, but he's 3rd on par 5s and 1st in birdies in his past 24. Fowler has finished 6th, 16th, and 1st from 2010 to 2012. He was 73rd and 38th in 2013 and 2014 and returned in 2016 to finish 4th.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Despite being fairly indifferent here over the years, it is at least promising that his two best finishes have come on his last four starts, suggesting he has found a way of playing well here. In the lead up to Augusta, Rose had finished T13 at Bay Hill and T15 a week later in Houston, so he has been in great form in recent starts. If he can carry that form over to this week, he could well make an impact at the top of the leaderboard.
Rose  ->  positive

Noren has won five European Tour events in the past year, including the BMW PGA two weeks ago (where he shot a final round 62). Noren is a great ball striker and putter, and shouldn’t be intimidated in this field. He was in contention at the Wells Fargo Championship several weeks ago, as well.
Noren  ->  positive

He’s 7th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, over the past 24 rounds. Jon Rahm ($10,800) has scored the most DK Points over his past 24 rounds. He’s 1st in Strokes Gained: Total and 2nd in Strokes Gained: Approach in that time frame.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

When finishing 13th in 2015, Rose ranked 6th in SG: Approach and 9th in SG: Tee-to-Green so he struck the ball extremely well and it was just his short game that let him down that week. Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending. In his last two starts, Rose has ranked 29th (Northern Trust) and 3rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Around-the-Green, so his play around the greens seems to coming round at the right time.
Rose  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the John Deere Classic - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 22/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Turning the clock back 2 years to 2015, Jordan Spieth won this event in a play-off from Tom Gillis with the very much in-form Danny Lee and Zach Johnson only a shot behind. Spieth was a 4/1 shot, with Zach Johnson at 11/1 and Danny Lee 80/1.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

East Lake is one of those rare tests on the PGA Tour where accuracy from the tee needs to be respected, especially on a course which ranked as the 6th hardest to hit fairways on the Tour across season 2015/16. In terms of ball-striking, the last 7 champions here have ranked - McIlroy 2nd, Spieth 7th, Horschel 9th, Stenson 8th, Snedeker 5th, Haas 3rd and Furyk 3rd, so hitting both fairways and greens here is a pre-requisite for victory. That solid core of play both with tee shots and approach shots is magnified on the basis that East Lake always ranks in the top 15 or so for scrambling difficulty on the PGA Tour.
Spieth  ->  positive

In reality, that just doesn't happen. In-Play Tactics  Given Holmes was the first winner on the PGA Tour to come from six back with a round to go since Matt Jones had done so in this event 12 months earlier, it's clearly possible to win from some way off the pace but Jim Herman won from the front last year and that felt like normal service had resumed. Both the 2014 and 2015 results were unique in their own way.
Holmes  ->  positive

It was nice to see Tommy getting the respect his status in world golf now deserves from the PGA Tour as he was paired up in one of the ‘featured groups’ at Riviera with Phil Mickelson, and as you would expect he had no issues in producing a good performance in the environment that comes with playing in a group with Phil in California and with Tiger in the group just ahead. Tommy’s GIR stats have been off the radar over the past 12 months plus and assuming it is ‘normal service’ from him this week I would expect the test offered by PGA National, particularly this week, to play right to his strengths and I am happy to jump on board the ‘Fleetwood Express’. GRAEME MCDOWELL – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  GMac this week is one of those selections that is so blatantly obvious that if you don’t back him and he performs, you’ll be left scratching your head as why on earth you weren’t on.
Tommy  ->  positive

Cameron Smith's form has just dipped slightly so it's Patrick Cantlay who rates the biggest danger to Matsuyama, as he certainly has the game and the temperament to thrive in the format. Indeed, with Matsuyama's long-game extremely rusty at Bay Hill, it would be the consistent Cantlay who gets the vote to advance and as he's seeded to face Tyrrell Hatton in the last-16, the Californian is worth backing at prices around the 50/1 mark. This is an excellent opportunity to stake a claim for a Ryder Cup place, and we saw last year with Rahm that inexperience need not be a barrier to success.
Cantlay  ->  positive

We all know it's coming and this week is a huge opportunity for the Georgia Tech product. RESULT: MC  Jhonattan Vegas 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  I'm always preaching patience so let's stick with Jhonattan Vegas for a further week on a course where he has a habit of playing well.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Steve Stricker  The old man still likes to come over to the PGA Tour from time to time when he's not crushing his competition on the Champions Tour, where he has finished second and first in his past two starts. Stricker still makes his way down to Copperhead, as it is a perfect course for his game, as he has made a career of being one of the most accurate players on tour ... who happens to hit a lot of greens and can still putt as well. He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach.
Steve Stricker  ->  positive

After adding to his soaring P/L with 200/1 each-way tip Scott Stallings last week, Dave Tindall picks out three bets for the PGA Tour's Genesis Open in California...  "A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

FedEx Cup champion Justin Thomas is looking for three straight wins in the CIMB Classic at TPC Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this week. Justin Thomas has won the last two editions of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the USPGA champion will be looking to become the first player on the PGA Tour to win a tournament three years running since Steve Stricker achieved that feat in the John Deere Classic between 2009 and 2011. A limited field of 78 players will tee it up at TPC Kuala Lumpur with Justin Thomas and World Number 3 Hideki Matsuyama the star attractions.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Aaron Wise  ->  positive

Branden Grace withdrawing after the first round definitely beat up a number of otherwise promising cash lines as well. Poor Sunday performances by Kisner (77), CH3 (74), and RCB (74) further dinged our cash hopes, but fortunately a huge performance by the constantly underrated Gary Woodland along with solid showings by Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Brendan Steele, and a few of our hedge plays buoyed a number of subscribers to a positive ROI, including myself. I’d also like to extend a special congratulations for Scott P. on a pretty sizable GPP hit this week as well – nice work buddy!
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

If it does this week, Steele could easily take on this loaded field and come out with the big check. James Hahn $7,100 – To say, “Hahn enjoys the West Coast swing,” may be the understatement of the year. In his 6th event in a row, Hahn arrives at Riviera having gained 33 strokes on the field in his last six tournaments.
Hahn  ->  positive

6th at the 2012 Callaway Pebble Beach Invitational, he also finished 3rd here in his rookie 2013 PGA Tour season where he led after 54 holes. Confident with the putter right now, we know that Hahn can win on the classical courses like Riviera and Quail Hollow. He also has a great reason to be motivated this week: Hahn struggles in Florida, so at Number 60 in the OWGR, if he wants to get into The Masters it's pretty much now or Riviera next week.
Hahn  ->  positive

Per FantasyGolfMetrics, DJ ranks 4th in strokes gained: tee to green and 1st off the tee over the past 12 weeks. Jordan Spieth ($12,000 | 12) - Spieth bounced back from a missed cut two weeks ago to finish 20th at Pebble Beach last week. At Riviera, Spieth's past four include three top 25s (12th, 4th, 22nd) and a missed cut in 2016.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Peterson & Loupe at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) - locals who also look a nice blend at their best  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Spurred on perhaps by the innovation of the European Tour, combined with substandard fields and poor TV figures, the Zurich Classic of New Orleans and PGA Tour officials have conjured up a new team format which can already be called a success. In its former guise, the Zurich Classic did produce the odd high-profile winner – Bubba Watson and Justin Rose among the more notables – but it had essentially become an opportunity for a lesser-light to secure their breakthrough, such as when Brian Stuard outlasted Jamie Lovemark and Byeong-hun An in a Monday play-off one year ago. Now a two-man team event with 80 pairs set to tee off, organisers have been rewarded with a star-studded field headed by Jason Day and Rickie Fowler, who marginally top the market from Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, set to renew their Ryder Cup partnership at a course Rose knows well.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

He ranks 18th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 1st in Strokes Gained Approach, 7th in Proximity, 15th and 10th in Par 4 & 5 Scoring and 9th in Birdie or Better %. Patrick Reed  Vegas Odds - 16/1  Draftkings - $9,700  FantasyAces - $5,700  While he isn't quite the amazing value he was at the Barclays when he started the playoffs at $8,800 on DraftKings, he is still a terrific value under $10K this week. He sits first in the standings after his win to open the playoffs and backed that up with a T5 last week at the Deutsche Bank Championship.

What I like most is the value price this week as he comes in the low $8K range on DraftKings and the mid $9K range on FanDuel making him a top target in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Tommy Fleetwood  World Golf Ranking (#11)  Vegas Odds (18/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($11,300)    Before coming over to the PGA Tour in mid-February, Tommy Fleetwood was on fire in Europe posting three straight finishes of 6th or better including a win at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. During those three events, he also recorded 12 straight rounds in the 60's.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
Stenson  ->  negative

The Australian might not be a household name, but he's a former PGA Tour rookie of the year, who now has three high-profile wins worldwide, including an impressive one in the Nedbank Challenge and another at Bay Hill last month. The latter was particularly noteworthy in that Leishman at last grabbed an opportunity with both hands, making clutch par saves on the final two holes to win by one in an important, poignant renewal of a high-profile event, securing a win which had in truth been long overdue. All of which sets him up for another big major run, and that's something Leishman is very familiar with.
Leishman  ->  positive

Casey has certainly performed well at other longer par 71 and 72 venues, such as Riviera and the Houston Golf Club, and there’s little reason to think Quail’s tougher layout won’t be a good fit for him. From a fantasy perspective, Casey also ranks as one of the better values this week as his $7,800 salary is the lowest it’s been since the Masters; this is despite his streak of constantly returning value, week in week out on DraftKings. Sometimes persistence pays off, and Casey is certainly someone who I could see breaking through at an event in which five of the last seven champions have been first-time major winners.
Casey  ->  positive

He was matched at [690.0] in-running and he was quoting as saying "I quite simply had nothing out there" after round one so Tommy did well to close with rounds of 67 and 66 to climb up to 14th given no other Honda contenders shone. In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

For a regular tour event, this field is stacked. Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Throw in a couple of solid finishes at the PRO in the past, and you’ve got one of my picks to win. Chris Kirk ($9,100) – Kirk has missed back-to-back cuts on tough tracks, and now comes to an easy course in a weak field. This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one.
Kirk  ->  positive

He makes great salary relief for DJ, and could find himself with a top-25 this week. John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards).
John Huh  ->  positive

He’s accurate off the tee and rarely ends up in any deep trouble, missing both the fairway and rough 2.26% of the time (14 ), and just needs a few decent rounds with the putter to contend. Russell Henley ($7100) : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

And while there are no guarantees that trend continues, the extra public humiliation Peterson put on himself, and the fact he finished T11 at TPC San Antonio back in 2015, suggests it might. In a weak field, Peterson is definitely a player you can consider on DraftKings as his past record, and propensity for quick bounce backs lines him up for a potentially big week. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Peterson  ->  positive

Russell Knox has lost his way of late but given he was third (when favourite!) last year and second in 2015, I thought [80.0] was just too big and my last two are big outsiders that I backed last year - Brian Stuard and Fabián Gómez. The latter is little more than a hopeful punt on someone who should like the course but I really like Stuard.
Stuard  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($9,000 | 18/1) - Rickie always has big ownership, but it's justified because he either fits the course well or is playing well or has played at that particular course well. Fowler has finished top-10 (10th, 10th, 8th) in the past three years at this event and was 2nd back in 2011. He was 2nd at the Memorial, cut at the St. Jude, 5th at the U.S. Open, 3rd at the Quicken Loans, 9th at the Scottish Open, and 22nd at The Open.
Rickie  ->  positive

Ogilvy comes into North Carolina on the back of three top-30 finishes in his last four starts and he’s had success when he’s made the trek to North Carolina in the past, having made the cut in 10 out of 11 appearances at this event. Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well. While he’s more of a GPP play, Ogilvy is a player you can target given his improved recent form (13th overall in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green at the Valero) and affinity for this event/region.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  Price: $12,000  It's fair to assume Spieth will be the least owned of the top three options this week. Not only is he the most expensive player in the field, but Justin Thomas has won his last two tournaments, while Hideki Matsuyama has finished first, second and fourth in his three appearances at this tournament. While I would probably go with one of them in cash games, I like Spieth, who placed seventh in his only other trip to TPC Scottsdale in 2015, has quietly finished third in back-to-back tournaments and ranks first in GIR percentage, as a contrarian pick in GPP and tournament formats.
Spieth  ->  positive

Lee has made seven straight cuts this year. When Lee last played this event in 2015, he finished in third place. Lee is above average in each Birdie or Better category and is 36th overall in 2017.
Lee  ->  positive

Here are my picks for 2017 Northern Trust. Jason Day 20/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds) 2 pts e/w:  Jason Day looks to have found some consistency again and when that happens it is time to stand up and take notice. Day is still win-less so far this season, however he has twice gone close finishing 2nd at the AT&T Byron Nelson and T5 at Pebble Beach earlier in the year.
Day  ->  positive

Something tells me he puts four rounds together this week and finds the top 10. Fade: Bubba Watson. Just not the same player he once was.
Bubba Watson.  ->  negative

But you only have to drop six points to find Marc Leishman at 22/1 and I just think he's far more likely to challenge and outperform all the elite names on show. The Aussie already has four top sixes in majors (Harman and Perez have one each) and three of those have come in the Open Championship - the best test of creativity and excelling in the wind. Leishman also beat stellar fields last season to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational and BMW Championship (third leg of the FedEx Cup play-offs).
(Harman  ->  positive

Hero Chall Picks D Johnson 7s 3pts Win B Koepka 12s 2.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4 [as advised y/day] K Kisner 33s 1.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4
Kisner  ->  positive

Major-less Matsuyama is an almost perfect fit too (T4 in last year's US PGA, aged 25, world-ranked 3rd, a two-time winner this year, runner-up in the US Open and a five-shot champ at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday). He's also got good course form with T11 on his last visit but Fowler's previous win at Quail Hollow suggests he's the most powerful stats fit. Rickie gets the nod but the stats are certainly with anyone backing Matsuyama also.
Fowler's  ->  positive

Last year, the local Wilmington Star newspaper said described Haas as a "frequent visitor". With Haas, it goes beyond just the local affiliation. He's shown plenty of good form this season, highlighted by his third place at the WGC-Dell Match Play in Texas at the end of March.
Haas  ->  positive

Also noteworthy is the fact that he has won immediately after one of these major near-misses, albeit again in modest company out in Malaysia, while he's been second at Augusta and fourth at Firestone to tick those correlating course boxes. Oosthuizen ranked second in strokes-gained tee-to-green in the PGA Championship where he also putted better than the field average every day, so if able to pick up where he left off rates a big player in his bid to finally win on US soil. While Oosthuizen is already secure on the International Presidents Cup team, Ryan Moore needs to produce right now if he's to earn a debut for the United States.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
Kevin Na  ->  negative

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD  ->  positive

Spieth ranks 22nd on tour in that range and was 10th before struggling with the new greens at the Players. Backing up his putting, Spieth ranks 2nd in BA and BoB% and he comes in 6th in Par 4 Scoring. Coming off missed cuts in two of his last three events, we may get Spieth at reduced ownership this week, which makes him a great play in GPPs.
Spieth  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $11900 – Spieth led the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green last season, and though he’s fallen short of expectation, this week represents opportunity for the young star. Spieth was T12 last season here and appears to be finding his putter just in time to tame the tricky greens at Club de Golf Chapultepec. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Patrick Cantlay, $10000 – Cantlay turned some heads with a win in Las Vegas in late 2017, and he has continued to prove he’s an up-and-coming young talent.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

A theme I think we will continue to see at every tournament this year. Last week’s results: Snedeker & English- rather lackluster  Stats:2016-17 stats now used  Birdie or Better*- Always Spieth, JT, Matsuyama, Knox, Piercy, Rahm  175-200 Approach Shots- Spieth, Lee, Hun-an, Oosthuizen, Finau  Ball Striking- Stanley, Spieth, Horschel, Glover, Herman  Strokes Gained Putting- Day, English, Baddeley, Mickelson, Molder  Tee to Green- JT, Rahm, Glover, Steele, Stanley  Trends:  Average Winning Score Since 2004- -18 *Phil Mickelson shot -28 in 2013 so it kind of skews this number a bit. Average Cut Score: Even  Stats from Last Year’s Winner- Rough Proximity  Player Focus: Guys, there’s no other way to say it – I nailed it.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Unlike last week in Augusta National, you don’t need to be long on this course so a lot of the shorter more accurate players should come into the mix. Russell Henley 25/1  Henley is in fine form lately and comes to Harbour Town with a win and three top 11’s in his last four starts. He had a great week at the Valspar posting a T9 which included an opening round 64.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

. Mr. Spieth If You’re Nasty  Jordan Spieth ($11,500) is the only other player in the field with odds to win greater than 10 percent this week: He’s currently at 11.1 percent. Spieth’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score and 17.0 LT Adj Bird Avg are both second this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama went off 12/1 for the last major championship  That has to be taken on board, and he was never in the mix at Bay Hill on his return, but three rounds at the Match Play will have helped speed up his recovery and he showed much better signs in all of them, particularly from tee-to-green. After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

The same aspects that made Lefty a good play last week when he was written up (T22 finish) are in play here:  14 th in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 8 th in Approach 50-125, 49 th in 150-175  in Approach 50-125, 49 in 150-175 23 rd in SG: Around the Green  in SG: Around the Green 10 th in Putting Average  in Putting Average 9th in Birdie or Better %  Look for him to try to take the W before skipping the U.S. Open for his daughter’s graduation, and he’ll almost need it to pay off that salary hit. Chez Reavie ($6400): Reavie is another golfer with stellar historical Strokes Gained data, although in a smaller sampler than Phil – he’s only played the course twice since 2012, finished T11 and T27, but en route to those finishes he averaged 2.5 SG:P and 1.17 SG:Tee to Green. He’s a riskier play as he enters the week in terrible form, but as Si Woo Kim and Billy Horschel have shown recently, form is not the be all and end all.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

I'm sure a win this week, leaving a tilt at the FedEx Cup, 2017 Player of the Year and World Number 1 spot in Atlanta next week, will be a huge motivator. RESULT: T7  Marc Leishman 1.25pt EW 45/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  We have seen lesser names surprise at this stage with Billy Horschel doing amazingly well at TPC Boston in 2014, before ultimately losing a title he probably should have won.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday.
Stroud,  ->  positive

Local ties have been important here in the past with the likes of Bowditch and Jimmy Walker taking the title, and they point towards Tom Hoge perhaps going better than many expect. Hoge is a strong iron player who, like Landry, fell down the leaderboard last week having played nicely throughout the first three days, something we saw earlier in the year when he produced his best-ever finish on the PGA Tour in taking third at the Sony Open. Rather than back the former Texas Christian graduate outright, I'd rather take heed of those regular fast starts of his and back him in the first-round leader market.
Landry,  ->  positive

Other: David Lipsky (coming off 2nd place finish, has won at altitude before)  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Gary Woodland, Paul Casey, Martin Kaymer, Louis Oosthuizen  – Thomas Pieters, Pablo Larrazabal, Alex Noren, Danny Willett, David Lipsky, Ben An, Jason Dufner  Good luck with your DraftKings WGC Mexico Championship lineups and picks, and make sure you’re checking back on our Golf Picks section to get Keagan and Alex’s picks that will be posted by Tuesday evening. He’s played great at the Omega Masters over the years (won there in 2015 and runner-up in 2012) so can definitely handle the altitude shift. Don’t forget that he finished T5 in his second last start and won’t have to deal with questions about fan behavior here; and that should help him get out of his own head this week.
Noren,  ->  positive

He is going to be popular(2nd most tagged on FanShare at this point) this week, especially on DraftKings under the $9K mark but makes a high upside play safe in all formats. Hideki Matsuyama  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,700)  FanDuel ($9,600)  Hideki has one more year of experience here at TPC Sawgrass but very similar form as Thomas and has also gotten better each year. Despite shooting no rounds under 70 in 2014, he was very consistent through four rounds and finished T23.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

He can ride those same skills to victory here. Spieth won this event by 10 in 2014 a week after taking victory in the Australian Open. He's just won that event for a second time after hitting some clutch shots when it really mattered so the omens and practicalities (dealing with jet-lag, the ability to win back-to-back) point to another at an Albany course where he was fourth on debut last year.
Spieth  ->  positive

European Tour's Race to Dubai will return soon. Golf Channel (PlayFantasyGolf.com)      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”    Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Marc Leishman ($28,100)  Pat Perez ($22,900)  Wesley Bryan ($5,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Austin Cook ($2,500)    Analysis: Going to ride the course horse (Spieth) and current form (Leishman). The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth (10,600)  One of the odd things about this event is that we see top players at the lowest salaries we may have seen them at all year. Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week. Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs.
Spieth  ->  positive

At this price he looks a great low ownership GPP play. The Fade:  Scott Piercy ($9,800) – Piercy has played well recently, but having performed when almost 20% owned last week, I feel like he’s going to be heavily owned again. With this track more focused on accuracy, I’m not convinced he can perform as well this week.
Scott Piercy  ->  negative

He brings good upside for a cheaper price tag and is a solid target this week in DFS. My Sleeper: Ben Martin ($6,900)  Martin quietly put together four solid rounds last week, finishing his week off with a 65 and a T7 finish. This was the second solid finish in a row for Martin, who also finished T22 in his penultimate start at the RSM Classic.
Martin  ->  positive

He let us down last week with just a top-40, but the price remains low. Jimmy Walker ($8,500 | 110) - Walker is nothing more than a dice roll at his price. He's 125th in the field in strokes gained: tee to green over the past 12 and is still working his way back after being diagnosed with Lyme disease.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Remember that a 120-man field yields a higher chance at making the cut, so there’s a bit more comfortability when selecting fliers in GPP formats with the lowest score on a roster being dropped. Past Champions    *Not held at TPC Potomac    2016 - Billy Hurley III  2015 - Troy Merritt  2014 - Justin Rose  2013 - Bill Haas  2012 - Tiger Woods  2011 - Nick Watney  2010 - Justin Rose    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Rickie Fowler - $19,100    Selecting the most-expensive player paid off last week as Jordan Spieth won the Travelers Championship, and there’s good reason to back the betting favorite again this week. Fowler ranks first on Tour in total driving, 12th in SG: Approach, and seventh in SG: Putting, and his elite all-around skill set is tough to pass up against below-average competition.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

284 yards (17th), 69.6% fairways (60th), 72.2% greens in regulation (33rd), proximity to hole 28'9" (16th), 65.0 % scrambling (32nd), 1.54 putts per GIR (1st). 2014, Brian Harman (-22). 303 yards (18th), 80.4% fairways (8th), 87.5% greens in regulation (1st), proximity to hole 23'3" (2nd), 66.7 % scrambling (29th), 1.70 putts per GIR (31st).
Brian Harman  ->  positive

With excellent current form and a razor sharp game DJ looks like the man to beat here. Jon Rahm 28/1  This guy is a serious player and comes here in great form with a win, two top 10’s and a top 20 in his last five starts. Rahm played well at the World Cup of Golf back in December finishing T8 on 13 under par in total.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Some courses are just going to be too big for him, but a place like Copperhead is where he can thrive, evidenced by his playoff runner-up finish last year. Graham DeLaet ($8,400) – Don’t look now, but DeLaet is starting to regain his PGA Tour relevance at a very rapid pace. With top 20 finishes at Phoenix, Riviera, and PGA National, DeLaet is clearly returning to form as one of the best ball strikers in the game, even if his scrambling and putting still aren’t quite up to snuff.
DeLaet  ->  positive

Other: Jason Kokrak  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Bud Cauley, Daniel Berger, Louis Oosthuizen, Lucas Glover, Michael Thompson, Harold Varner III, William McGirt, Jon Rahm, Kevin Kisner  – Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Geoff Ogilvy, Jason Kokrak, Emiliano Grillo, Hudson Swafford  Bets If the new course plays anything like the old one Ogilvy could surprise here, he’s made 10 of 11 cuts at the Wells Fargo and has generally handled longer par 72’s like Eagle Point well over his career. The Aussie has shown some form of late though with three finishes of T32 or better in his last four starts, and tee to green he’s been above average lately, as evidenced by his 16th ranking in that category for the week at the Valero.
Bill Haas,  ->  positive

It's hard to do justice to how big an achievement that would be for a player who was returning from years out of the game, playing on a medical and well outside the world's top 1000 back in January. And while glowing praise around his achievements doesn't mean much in relation to this event, Cantlay would be a top-40 player in birdie average terms had he played enough rounds to qualify, and his no-weakness, all-round game seems ideally suited to a course which has thrown up all kinds of players. Cantlay shot 60 when playing in the Travelers Championship as an amateur back in 2011 so his adaptability and scoring prowess is not in question and he does actually have some experience of Conway Farms, having played in the Western Amateur here back in 2009.
Cantlay  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Fed Ex St Jude Classic - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brooks Koepka 2pts EW 12/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Last week we had Rickie Fowler on board to contend for the title at The Memorial on the basis that he tends to perform well pre-Major. I was surprised to hear on Thursday that he'd added TPC Southwind to his schedule at the last minute and he probably regrets it now after a very strong outing in Ohio.
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.
Jim Furyk  ->  negative

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Still only 23, the man from Brisbane was runner-up at his home Australian Open in November after losing in a three-way playoff to Jordan Spieth no less. Smith had made it to extra holes after shooting a final-round 66 after starting the final day five back. The consolation prize was a spot in this summer's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and look out for him there too.
Smith  ->  positive

Charl Schwartzel took the title in a playoff last year and I fancy the person he beat to go one better this time. Bill Haas was leading going into the final round but couldn’t quite hold off the South African and is looking for redemption this week. The good news is that Haas returns in excellent form.
Haas  ->  positive

Like McGirt, he also has some eye-catching post-major form away from his performances here. Cauley placed after both the Open and the US PGA in 2012, while earlier this year he was a solid ninth in the RBC Heritage just after the Masters. Indeed, in terms of world ranking points, 10 of his best 20 finishes have come either a week before, a week after or during the week of a major championship, so the timing of the Travelers is ideal for him.
Cauley  ->  positive

He currently has the highest Vegas odds to win and carries the highest salary on both DraftKings and FanDuel. Fowler is also one of the top gofers in all eight of our Player Models. Fowler’s 68.4 Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) and 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score both rank second overall this week, and he is tied for eighth in the field with his 62.2 LT SC percentage.
Fowler  ->  positive

Brian Harman ($11,500) may be the hottest golfer on the planet right now: He’s finished no worse than fourth in his two tournaments in 2018 and he hasn’t finished outside of the top 10 in his last five tournaments. Harman is also Hump’s pick to win, which means he’ll likely shoot an 85 on Thursday and withdraw from the tournament. Harman is tied for 10th with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score, while his 67.6 Recent Adj Rd Score and 79.2 Recent GIR percentage both lead the field among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Spain's Jon Rahm continues to impress but he's making his Sawgrass debut this week and only Hal Sutton (1983) and Craig Perks (2002) have won The Players at the first attempt. Selections    Russell Henley has already won twice in Florida and he's been in fine fettle this year, winning the Shell Houston Open and finishing 11th at the US Masters. His form figures here read a fairly uninspiring MC-17-24-MC but he sat second after round one and third at halfway in 2014 when he finished 17th so he's been in-the-mix here before.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

He is also 26th or better in GIR from 150-175, 175-200 and 200+ yards. BOTTOM TIER TARGET ($6K/$7K RANGE)  Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports  Russell Knox ($7,100)  The chalk is clearly falling on Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Adam Scott, and Jhonattan Vegas in this range which gives us a few GPP pivot options. I start with Knox as he come sback to TPC Boston with a nice record finishing T26, T12, T15 in his only three trips here.
Knox  ->  positive

RESULT: T44  I'll also have a dabble with a couple of longer shots at a tournament where we know crazy winners can and do happen:  Ryan Palmer 0.5pt EW 150/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Texan Ryan Palmer loves a home game and despite a very poor period of play he ranks 7th in this week's Published Predictor Model. Palmer, who co-led at PGA National after 36 holes last time out, loves to play in his home state: top 5s and top 10s abound for Ryan across TPC San Antonio, TPC Four Seasons and his home course of Colonial. Statistically Palmer sits 9th in Going for the Green and 48th in Proximity from 150 to 175 yards, which are 2 key statistics for the GC of Houston.
Ryan  ->  positive

Henley sits fifth in SG Approach and tenth in DK points in his last eight rounds at Kapalau. Look for Henley to continue to build on last year. Kevin Chappell, 7700: Chappell comes off a rough Hero, but that was due to a rough weekend.
Henley  ->  positive

Maybe he is looking for some guidance this week, whatever it is, I really do believe Horschel can bounce back from the missed cut last week, with a huge week here at Bay Hill. Brooks Koepka 100/1 (StanJames 6 places + Betway, William Hill and Ladbrokes) 0.5pt e/w:  From one golfer who needs some help to another, I also think Brooks Koepka is worth a bet at the same price as Horschel. Koepka has been in dismal form in 2017, finishing no better than his T42 at the Phoenix Open so far, so why am I backing him this week?
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

He showed some decent form with a pair of top 15s in Florida but missed cuts on his last two starts are negatives and overall I'll look elsewhere. Justin Thomas and Bud Cauley could go well and were close to getting the nod. Thomas needs no introduction after his three wins this season but the extra positives are a T12 on his only start at the Zurich Classic and a strong weekend at Augusta National (T22).
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices. My mind goes back to Augusta Sunday when Justin Rose was in the middle of the 13th fairway with a 2-shot lead and Sergio Garcia was taking a penalty drop.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

However, if Uihlein is going to pick up a PGA Tour win in the 2017-2018 season, the fall swing season seems like an ideal time to get the job done. Ollie Schniederjans – $8,300  Similar to Uihlein, Ollie Schniederjans has to be one of the favourites to pick up his first career win in the fall swing series. Ollie had a great 2017 season, although it didn’t end quite as well as he had hoped.
Uihlein  ->  positive

But it's been a trend in recent years for players to get hot and stay hot and Justin Thomas has already reminded us of that with his back-to-back wins in Hawaii. It's probably too premature to put Swafford in that bracket but it makes sense to leave some chips on the table and back him here as this really is an excellent fit for the Georgia Bulldog. Swafford smashes it a mile (he's been 5th and 1st in Driving Distance on his two starts in 2017) and does pretty much everything well.
Swafford  ->  positive

Before his 60th-place finish at TPC Sawgrass, Fowler had finishes of 4th, 1st, 16th, 12th, 3rd, and 11th (Zurich team play notwithstanding). To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well. That history may be the one thing that keeps Fowler’s ownership down, which would be an added bonus.
Fowler  ->  positive

Pre-event pick, Scott Piercy, sits tied for 30th and five off the lead and he looks to have too much on his plate but James Hahn is close enough if good enough on -8 and I'm happy I followed Paul Krishnamurty in with his three Find Me a 100 Winner selections. Michael Thompson is alongside Piercy after a disappointing second round but Chesson Hadley and Grayson Murray are both alongside Hahn in a tie for 11th and I'm just going to cheer those on for now. 09:35 - March 30, 2017  A weather delay yesterday morning has meant round one of the Houston Open is yet to be completed and that's always frustrating when trying to assess the state of play.
James Hahn  ->  positive

He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
Laird  ->  negative

For you course history guys he has made the cut in four straight years with finishes of T49, T45, T28, T27 which he could easily top this year as he comes in with, by far, the best form of his career. Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (81st)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($7,700)  FantasyAces ($4,900)  I can already tell I will be running 50+ lineups this week as I keep adding more and more players to the article. I can't help it.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Peterson is a brilliant ball-striker who has rededicated himself and with some results this season, while Loupe is long, aggressive and volatile. It could make for a disaster, but if Loupe is on a going week he can make birdies with the best of them and I can see him being given the opportunity to shine in fourballs in particular, with Peterson likely to stay out of trouble even after a couple of disappointing weeks. Both have the expected ties to this event – Peterson was T8 on an invite in 2013, while Loupe made his PGA Tour debut here (note: Kevin Chappell’s pro PGA Tour debut came in the Texas Open, which he won last week).
Loupe  ->  positive

He will be a staple in all of my cash lineups and will also be using him in GPP formats. Who the Stats Like  Ollie Schniederjans  World Golf Ranking (#79)  Vegas Odds (45/1)  Draftkings ($7,600)  FanDuel ($9,400)    Ollie currently sits 10th overall in my stats model this week thanks to his rank of 11th in SG: APP(31st or better in Proximity from 125-200+ yards), 20th in Par 5 SCoring, 21st in Par 4 Scoring, and 7th in Birdie or Better %. Stats are definitely not the only place he stands out this week as he comes in with the 12th best odds in the field(45-1) while his DraftKings price ranks 27th overall.
Ollie Schniederjans  ->  positive

My final selection is 23 year old world number 211 Michael Kim. A former amateur standout, Kim was voted the best collegiate golfer in America in 2013, generally a decent guide to future success as a pro if previous winners Justin Thomas, Russell Henley, Bill Haas, Ryan Moore and Kevin Chappell are anything to go by. Kim is a PGA Tour sophomore so his body of work is largely incomplete but on debut here last year, he fired a third round 66 on route to a 47th place finish, demonstrating an affinity for the course.
Kim.  ->  positive

Brian Harman ($10900) – Guaranteed to have some chalk behind his name, this past champion has had some great form this year which showed itself to a worldwide audience at Erin Hills with a T2 finish to go along with his earlier win at the Wells Fargo. Those two factors along with the overall weakness of the field means Harman will probably be the chalkiest player this week, but he also has some of the highest win upside both statistically and based on his past performance in Illinois: three top-25s (including that win in 2014) to go with two missed cuts in five total tries. Harman is having his best year on tour yet, smashing his previous career earnings and currently sitting in 11th in the Fed Ex Cup standings, and that shows in his overall play this year:  94 Birdies per Round (22 nd )  ) 8 th in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 th in One-Putt %  in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 in One-Putt % 99 Par-4 Scoring Average (15 th )  ) 45% Birdie or Better % (24th)  He does struggle a bit on approach, but a lot of that comes from hitting out of the rough where he struggles immensely.
Harman  ->  positive

All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year. Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches.
Hoffmann  ->  positive

The chart below shows some of the things golfers will need to do to either score (BoB%) or avoid bogeys (BoW%) – the Variance column highlights some of the differences between the two.

Poulter  ->  positive

Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice. DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th.

Also Consider: Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, J.B. Holmes  Dark Horse:  Lucas Glover ($8,600) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

He should be limited to GPP only on FanDuel where he is in the mid $10K range. Top Current Form Targets  Cameron Smith  World Golf Ranking (#58)  Vegas Odds (66/1)  Draftkings ($7,400)  FanDuel ($9,200)    Consistency plus DraftKings value is brought me back to Cameron Smith this week. After picking up just six Top 25's all of his rookie season, he has already posted five in his first five events to start the 2017-18 season including two Top 10 finishes and ranks 7th in the field in DraftKings scoring over his last 24 rounds.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

(Not that he'd show up, but still quite the question.) For now, we are left with a still-pretty-dang-intriguing tournament at Kapalua, with seven of the top eight in the OWGR on hand, including the top-five: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Hideki Matsuyama. Not too shabby.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

A T9 last year, on just his second start at this course gives a lot of hope, and hopefully he can emulate that success this week. Since his T5 in Houston, Berger has finished T27 at the Masters and T36 at the Wells Fargo last week, where he seemingly failed to get out of cruise control. One of the stats which always comes up here, even if it doesn’t rank as my most important is Scrambling and Berger ranks 12th in that area this season.
Berger  ->  positive

High-Priced  Jordan Spieth ($11,400) – Obviously Spieth, McIlroy and Day – the three top options on the board – have the upside of carrying you to a fantasy title, but each has enough variance in their game to make them more of a tournament play right now. All three should probably find their way into a lineup or two, but of them, Spieth is my favorite right now. He showed the most last weekend with his Sunday 69 to edge his way up the leaderboard somewhat.
Spieth  ->  positive

Even last week’s Honda Classic effort, where he missed the cut, offered some encouragement. Willett fought back from a nightmare start to shoot an opening 69 and was three-under with seven to play in round two, only for a couple of bogeys followed by a double at the difficult 17th to see him miss out by one. The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course.
Willett  ->  positive

Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups.
Day's  ->  positive

At his value price on both sites, he is another golfer I will be targeting in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#5)  Vegas Odds (10/1)  Draftkings ($11,400)  FanDuel ($12,600)    After finishing with a Top 10 at last years Tour Championship, Justin Rose sat at #13 in the world coming into this season. Since then he has picked up three wins on three different tours(HSBC Champions, Turkish Airlines Open, Indonesian Masters) and six other Top 10 finishes including back to back Top 5's coming into this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He played well at the Safeway Open finishing a respectable T13 and followed that with a T23 at the OHL Classic. Johnson then travelled to Sea Island for the RSM Classic where he shot 64,67 over the weekend to finish T8 on 13 under par for the tournament so his current form looks decent. Zach has a great record here and really seems to have the game to fit this course.
Johnson  ->  positive

More recently Day contended at the US PGA Championship and had it have not been for a third round 77, he may well have won his second major title, and the US PGA Championship for the second time in three years. Day shot an 8 on the par-4 18th in round three and that derailed his chances of winning massively. Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama.
Day  ->  positive

The good news is that he's posted T13 (2017) and T17 (2016) in the last two years so should approach this week with confidence after his trio of early exits from 2013-2015. Harman returns to Arnie's event as the World No. 22 having been ranked outside the top 100 when he teed it up at Bay Hill 12 months ago.
Harman  ->  positive

It’s hard to predict his ownership with him being an Augusta rookie, but right now Fantasy Labs currently has him projected for a decently low ownership level of 9-12%. I hope this ends up being true, because at only $6,900, Hadwin will be one of my most heavily owned players of the week. Bill Haas: (7,200) Haas’s low projected ownership of 5-8% (via Fantasy Labs), is insane when factoring in his recent form and course history.
Hadwin  ->  positive

There is quite a lot of water on the back 9 from holes 15-17, which play around a four acre lake and should offer quite a lot of excitement in the final round on Sunday. Justin Thomas 14/1  What a third round Justin had last week in Erin Hills. He carded an impressive nine birdies and an eagle to post a nine under 63.
Justin  ->  positive

For starters, Haas is in great form. His third-placed finish in the Match Play was a fine effort and came on the back of several others; it's no surprise that he's up with Fowler in the bogey avoidance (second) and scrambling (first) stats which should mean he can tackle Augusta's biggest challenge with confidence. It's something he's done before and in old money, Haas, aged 34 and making his eighth start in the Masters, would look an ideal type in a major where experience has always been considered a positive.
Fowler  ->  positive

Graeme McDowell.  ->  positive

He’s also playing pretty well with two top 5’s in his last 4 starts. Francesco Molinairi ($8,600) Molinari is one of the most consistent and reliable golfers out there. He did have a MC a couple weeks back but overall is 4/5 with all 4 inside the top 20.
Francesco  ->  positive

With great form and a good history here, look for Harman to continue his great year. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Kevin Streelman, $6800 – Though Streelman’s record at TPC Deere Run is hit or miss with three missed cuts and two top-10s, his recent form of five straight top-30s makes him an attractive value option. Daniel Summerhays, $6800 – Summerhays had victory in his sights at TPC Deere Run in 2013 before a bogey on the 72nd hole kept him out of a playoff.
Kevin Streelman,  ->  positive

Currently, Reed is looking like a cash game lock and a solid core player in my GPP grouping. Kevin Streelman – FanDuel Value – DK: $7300 FD: $8700  Streelman has been solid lately relying on gaining strokes off of the tee and approaching the green. Although he has been losing strokes putting that can easily turn around week to week and I like the way he has been playing recently.
Streelman  ->  positive

He's a two-time winner of the aforementioned Phoenix Open and I was more than happy to take [50.0]. I thought [60.0] was fair enough for Russell Henley given his remarkable form figures. In just four starts here, over the last four years, he's finished 45th, seventh, fourth and fifth and his form so far in 2017 has been respectable enough.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Scott has always been a player who, once confident, can perform at a high level for a prolonged period of time. Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best.
Scott  ->  positive

We have a wide open event in Texas for this week's PGA Tour offering, and here our man Steve Rawlings arms us with everything we need to know ahead of the Valero Texas Open...  "Moore's form slumped a little after his playoff defeat to Rory McIlroy at the Tour Championship but if his first career top-10 at Augusta last time out is anything to go by, the 34-year-old world number 28 looks ready to go in again." Tournament History  Having first been staged in 1922, the Valero Texas Open is one of the older events on the PGA Tour. The tournament was staged at La Cantera Golf Club between 1995 and 2009 before switching to its current venue - TPC San Antonio - in 2010.
"Moore's  ->  positive

He’s twice placed at Riviera, including on his latest start two weeks ago, and has also gone close at Kuala Lumpur, home of the CIMB Classic, plus Copperhead and Sawgrass. These events have all allowed Na to flourish with a game based around accuracy, and having looked in really good shape last time I can see him carrying that momentum to his best WGC finish, having done really well to share ninth at Doral a couple of years ago. Na is 25/1 for a top-five finish and 10s for a top-10, both of which look good business and the right way to go given that he has just one win to his name from over 300 starts.
Na  ->  positive

The Five-time major winner then traveled to Mexico and defeated Justin Thomas in a play-off after an exciting final round 66 at the WGC-Mexico Championship to claim his first victory since the 2013 Open. Mickelson has a great record here in Houston with form figures 55,13,17,12,16,4 including a win in 2011 in his last seven appearances. Statswise he is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee and ranks 19th in SGTTG, second in SGP and seventh in par 4 scoring.
Mickelson  ->  positive

It’s also a Pete Dye course design so fire up the typical plodders and target practice golfers >> Donald, Duke, Furyk, Casey, etc…(sadly, no Kuch or Haas this week).

Normally, I play my single bullet/top LU but I was feeling pretty good so stepped it up.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Selections    I've already got Rickie Fowler onside, after I backed him at Christmas when I wrote this piece here but whether I'd be going in now at around 22/1 after a disappointing missed cut in Memphis last week is debatable. Fowler ranks number one for Total Driving and he's a terrific links player and wind exponent. He's also a fabulous scrambler and he's the one currently wearing the best player to win a major badge.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

It was nice to see Tommy getting the respect his status in world golf now deserves from the PGA Tour as he was paired up in one of the ‘featured groups’ at Riviera with Phil Mickelson, and as you would expect he had no issues in producing a good performance in the environment that comes with playing in a group with Phil in California and with Tiger in the group just ahead. Tommy’s GIR stats have been off the radar over the past 12 months plus and assuming it is ‘normal service’ from him this week I would expect the test offered by PGA National, particularly this week, to play right to his strengths and I am happy to jump on board the ‘Fleetwood Express’. GRAEME MCDOWELL – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  GMac this week is one of those selections that is so blatantly obvious that if you don’t back him and he performs, you’ll be left scratching your head as why on earth you weren’t on.
Tommy  ->  positive

After running the world's top 40 players through all those qualification criteria, only five players survive. They are: Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia, Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell. Another stat:  Nine of the last 10 US Open winners were not the Masters champion  Sorry Sergio.
Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

His current form reminds me of Jordan Spieth in 2015 (who made the play-off) and I can see the Rahm charge continuing all the way to Magnolia Lane. RESULT: T10  Charley Hoffman 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  The first name that jumped off the entry list for me was Charley Hoffman who I think will go well again in his beloved Texas. With a Masters Invite safely in his back pocket, the World Number 52 will be looking forward to Augusta next week, but with his current form and his obvious liking for the GC of Houston he must be a contender for what would be his 5th career PGA Tour victory this week.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

The HSBC Champions is a tricky event to weight up because several of the classier players are making their first starts of the season and will they be fully wound up after a break? Justin Rose has plenty of incentive to win in China, he’s won at least once every year since 2010 but is winless in 2017 and would hate to end that streak. During the Playoffs he found some form with finishes of 10-10-2-10 in some strong (although limited) fields.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

So far, in the 36 rounds he has played this season, Reavie ranks 5th in SG: Tee-To-Green, 8th in SG: Approach-The-Green and 5th in SG: Total. Specifically important to this week, Reavie ranks 6th in Scrambling, 22nd in Greens in Regulation and 23rd in Ball Striking (10th in Driving Accuracy). There are six Par-4’s between 450-500 yards here at Riviera, and with Reavie averaging 290 yards off the tee this season, his approaches from 150-175 and 175-200 yards this week will be important.
Reavie  ->  positive

Miracles happen. Back Lucas Glover 1u ew @ 200/1    Speaking of miracles in majors, I've always felt Lucas Glover was one of the luckiest major champions. At Bethpage Black in 2009, he benefited from a very lop-sided draw, very un-like US Open conditions after torrential rain, and then did everything he could to throw it away.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

Three months later he went to another California venue with small greens and took T10 in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. From Memorial in June to the BMW in September, Hughes missed just one cut in 10 starts so he really has established himself at this level. On the stats last season, the 26-year-old finished 8th for Strokes Gained: Putting and only seven players racked up more than his 374 birdies.
Hughes  ->  positive

He finished 39th and scored just 68 DK points so the opportunity to capitalize on recency bias exists. Rose’s 68.4 LT Adj Rd Score is fifth, his 70.5 LT GIR percentage is seventh, and his 302.6-yard LT DD is 21st overall. Rose has made the cut at Riviera in five straight trips, including a 16th-place finish last year.
Rose’s  ->  positive

Look for him to add to the resume this week where he is comfortable on Bent grass. Kyle Stanley ($9,600) – It feels weird going back to Stanley after a victory but then I ask myself who else are you going to take in this field? Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass.
Stanley  ->  positive

Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus. They are:  Chesson Hadley (5th in SG: Approach)  Ollie Schniederjans (12th in SG: Approach)  Chris Kirk (19th in SG: Approach)  Course experience is helpful here, although Woodland did win in debut in 2011, but course form is general is not a sticking point. Another thing to bear in mind this week is the sheer amount of Par 3’s (five) as well as four Par 5’s.
Ollie Schniederjans  ->  positive

A two-time major championship winner, a FedEx Cup Champion, and a former World’s No. 1 golfer, Jordan Spieth is clearly one of golf’s brightest young stars. With a win and two third-place finishes in the first two months of 2017, he’s back to looking a bit like the Spieth of 2015, when he won five tournaments including the Masters and U.S. Open.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He comes back with some excellent course history(for the price) as he has a Top 25 finish in five straight trips and a Top 30 finish in nine straight trips to Innisbrook Resort. Looking at the same rolling report for Strokes Gained: Around the Green, Dufner ranks 19th, 34th, 15th, and 9th over his last 4, 8, 12, and 24 rounds here. Also using Fantasy National Golf Club, we notice that Dufner is an excellent wind player and with this week's forecast, that will be key.
Dufner  ->  positive

Lower Tier  Luke List ($7600) (Finished 29th here last year)  JJ Spaun ($7800)  Anirban Lahiri ($7300)  Sung Kang ($7400)  Nick Watney ($7500)  Martin Laird ($7700)  GPP wild cards with upside  Daniel Summerhays ($7000)  Freddie Jacobson ($6500)  Shawn Stefani ($6100)  Kevin Tway ($6000) I like him for his course history and the fact he ranks 4th in Bogey Avoidance for a course that could potentially see the winner in single digits under par. (Patrick Reed $9700 and Zach Johnson $9300 have worse odds to win it all than Billy does).
Shawn Stefani  ->  positive

For a player who ranked outside the top 100 in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, it's remarkable that he's now third on the PGA Tour in strokes-gained putting and this confidence with the flat-stick is filtering through his game, with the driver another major weapon. Leishman also figures highly in bogey avoidance (eighth), he's a top-25 par-five performer who figures in the 'sneaky long' category, and he's quite simply on top of the world right now especially as, after a life-threatening illness, wife Audrey is almost back to full health and the couple are expecting their third child. It's easy to see them enjoying a relaxed preparation, including the par-three tournament, and from there Leishman can launch another major challenge in an event he skipped to be by Audrey's side two years ago.
Leishman  ->  positive

Add it all up and the risk is much too high for the projected ownership but if you are wanting to get some of that local knowledge in your lineup, roster Webb on FanDuel in the mid $7K range. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage.
Haas  ->  positive

Hideki should easily be among the highest-owned players on all DFS golf websites, but he’s more than worth the salary and attention this week. Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

Selections    Tournament standing dishes, Zach Johnson and Steve Stricker were first and second favourites last year. They're getting long in the tooth now and Zach, in-particular, is struggling form wise but I thought they were worth small savers at around [30.0] and I also like the defending champ and this year's Heritage winner, Wesley Bryan. Ryan Moore hasn't played for five weeks because of a strained tendon in his left shoulder so there's a danger he's rushing back to make his defence.
Wesley Bryan.  ->  positive

Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

It has been a strange season for Rose, with injury problems playing their part. After finishing a close 2nd behind Sergio Garcia at the Masters in April, Rose struggled for form in the bigger events, missing the cut at both the U.S. Open and PGA Championship as well as finishing just T54 at the Open Championship and T63 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. A T4 finish at the Irish Open and T12 at Wentworth in that same span gave reason optimism though and once he got himself fully fit and in the right frame of mind, he managed to put together that great run during the FedEx play-offs.
Rose,  ->  positive

Last season, Spieth led the PGA Tour in SG: Approach and ranked 10th in terms of proximity. Hideki Matsuyama - $15,400    Despite his putting struggles, Matsuyama has notched a pair of top-three finishes in two appearances at the Tournament of Champions due to his elite ball-striking. During the 2016-17 season he ranked fifth on Tour in proximity on approaches from 150-175 yards and eighth in proximity from 175-200 yards.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

His birdie average of 3.89 per round is strong, especially considering his price point, and unless he ends up with Dustin Johnson, Rahm or Justin Thomas, he'll be have a great opportunity to upset a bracket. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks (for the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship)  Eric Axley  There are events each year where the field is a little bit weak, and then there are fields that are just barely above what we would see at a Web.com Tour event with not even enough names at the top to have big favorites overall. The key is going to be able to fit a couple of the decent names at the top onto your rosters this week, but you won't be able to do it without diving into the lower-salary tiers to find a couple of overlooked names.
Eric Axley  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

Reed's record defending titles is strong - he's never been worse than 24th in four attempts, and almost won back-to-back renewals of the Tournament of Champions only to finish second - and with form at Firestone and Muirfield Village in the bag, he looks a solid alternative to the better-fancied runners, few of whom are more prolific. While The Northern Trust (formerly The Barclays) has thrown up some strange names in the top five and a totally shock winner in Heath Slocum eight years ago, Reed was the seventh successive high-class winner, every one of them either a Presidents or Ryder Cup player in their own right. Perhaps unsurprisingly, four of these winners had gone really well at the PGA Championship in their previous start, finishing inside the top 10.
Reed  ->  positive

It was his first win in over 5 years and the way he saw off both Tyrrell Hatton in regulation and then 2018 form-horse Justin Thomas in a playoff was very, very impressive. Mickelson ticks every single statistical box I'm looking for this week, he's hitting the ball long and is hitting enough fairways to be competitive. 4th in Strokes Gained Approach tells a story and he's 2nd in Strokes Gained Putting.
Mickelson  ->  positive

This course presents him with arguably the best opportunity for him to get the win that will put the icing on the cake on an already impressive start to 2017. Jimmy Walker ($10,500) – It came to light during the Masters that Walker has been suffering from Mononucleosis since last November, which may explain his inconsistent form. A T18 finish at the Masters two weeks was his third top-20 of the season, but his T9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions (reduced field) still remains his lone top-10.
Walker  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 30-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 36th  No prizes for me for originality I’m afraid as my third pick this week goes to another player who was in our team at the Honda three weeks ago in the form of the inform Alex Noren. For want of copying and pasting my thoughts on Noren back at the Honda I shall simply say the obvious in that the Swede’s start to his first full season on the PGA tour has been hugely impressive. Based on current form there is every argument for his price to be as short, if not shorter than Rickie, Rory, Henrik and a returning Hideki and it is only a lack of course form I’m assuming which has sees him priced up as 30-1 shot.
NOREN  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
Bryson  ->  positive

Jon Rahm 20/1  Big hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm has made quite an impact on the PGA Tour this season with a win and seven top 10’s under his belt so far. After shooting a final round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open in February, Rahm bagged his first PGA Tour win at previous US Open venue, Torrey Pines, finishing on 13 under par in total. He has shown some great consistency this year finishing T5 at Pebble Beach, T3 at the WGC Mexico Championship, solo second at the WGC Matchplay, T10 in Houston, solo fourth at the Wells Fargo and a T2 at the Dean & Deluca in Colonial recently.
Rahm  ->  positive

Our man takes a look at this week's PGA Tour action, where Tiger Woods starts for the first time in 16 months. Read his comprehensive preview here...  "My only other pick is outsider, Brandt Snedeker, who’s playing the course for the first time. Sneds did me a favour last month when he easily won the inaugural Fuji International on an exposed, breezy course that isn’t too dissimilar to this one and he looks a very fair price."
Brandt Snedeker,  ->  positive

21st on debut here in 2013 was followed by 12th a year later and although he's not improved on that since, he arrives here this year in far better overall form and with a whole cabinet full of trophies acquired since then. RESULT: Winner  Kevin Chappell 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Jason Dufner 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (6 places, 1/5 odds):  A field of the highest quality this week may well produce a fairly obvious winner - indeed 3 of the past 4 winners have been single-figure chances before obliging - and with 2 decent bets on a couple of the shorter-priced players that doesn't leave a massive amount of room for manoeuvre.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Jhonattan Vegas  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($8,700)  It is a bit of a home game for Vegas this week as he attended the University of Texas just two hours down the road. Looking over a quote from last year(via Future of Fantasy Golfanac), Vegas is clearly comfortable playing here and it shows with the results recently as he has T15 and T19 in his last two trips to the Houston Open. He made an early exit from the WGC Match Play last week but did have a T20 at the WGC Mexico at the start of March and has made nine of 11 cuts so far this year so there is even some nice form coming in this time around.
Vegas  ->  positive

Those two factors along with the overall weakness of the field means Harman will probably be the chalkiest player this week, but he also has some of the highest win upside both statistically and based on his past performance in Illinois: three top-25s (including that win in 2014) to go with two missed cuts in five total tries. Harman is having his best year on tour yet, smashing his previous career earnings and currently sitting in 11th in the Fed Ex Cup standings, and that shows in his overall play this year:  94 Birdies per Round (22 nd )  ) 8 th in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 th in One-Putt %  in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 in One-Putt % 99 Par-4 Scoring Average (15 th )  ) 45% Birdie or Better % (24th)  He does struggle a bit on approach, but a lot of that comes from hitting out of the rough where he struggles immensely. He’s not the most accurate off the tee at only 62.52% of fairways hit, but with the width of the fairways and the lack of distance needed, he should be able to club down and pick his spots better than some of the other courses he’s played this year.
Harman  ->  positive

He is going to be popular as he is currently the top tagged golfer on FanShare but with his distance and all-around game, he is a top play in all formats. Stewart Cink  World Golf Ranking (#156)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($6,900)  FanDuel ($7,200)    Dipping down into the sub $7K range, we find Stewart Cink who ranks quite high in my stats model this week. While his SG: OTT ranks outside the Top 50, he averages about 294 yards off the tee and ranks 4th overall on the sheet in SG: APP.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

The left-hander has never managed a top 20 in an Open and had missed four of his previous eight cuts so it clearly was an event which troubled him. But Watson battled away to finish T27 and I think he can take the positives from that performance to Glen Abbey this week. He's still not found anywhere near the form which won him two Masters titles in three years but T6 at Memorial (a Jack Nicklaus design, as is Glen Abbey) was a reminder of his talents and he's made all three cuts in July and shot six of his last 12 rounds in the 60s.
Watson  ->  positive

The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four.
Chappell's  ->  positive

Scroll for tournament notes and 21 notables from the field of 36 two-man teams in Ridgedale, Missouri. If decisions were as easy as plugging in Charley Hoffman at the Valero Texas Open, then fantasy wouldn't be as much fun. But wait a minute.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

He started the season with a T7 at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia which included a second round 63 and a final round 65. Casey then tee’d it up at the CJ Cup finishing T19 and followed that with a T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions, T8 in Pebble and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship where he shot three rounds of 68 or better. Casey then went to Copperhead where he shot a final round 69 to post 10 under in total, one clear of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed.
Casey  ->  positive

Based at college in Florida for a while and comfortable here, this very good putter should see his tee-to-green efforts keep many bogeys off his card and I was happy to play around 75/80-1 this week. Another main tour maiden, Bud Cauley, was very high on the list until he withdrew from the Honda with a wrist injury so his inclusion here takes a chance he is fully recovered. However, his claims look as good as any of the three-figure prices on offer and I am happy to judge him on a number of decent comparative efforts.
Bud Cauley,  ->  positive

Having finished 6th at a similar course layout which he’d previously won, just eight starts ago, there’s no reason why he can’t pop up again at a great price. The World Ranking Play:  Charley Hoffman ($6,900) – A weak field and we have the 49th player in the world at $6,900. He also happens to be a former winner of the course so we know he can do well here.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Rory McIlroy  Making his first start at TPC River Highlands, McIlroy has plenty of incentive. He certainly didn't enjoy missing the cut at the U.S. Open, but the Twitter spat that evolved later with former PGA Championship winner Steve Elkington is sure to provide extra motivation.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Designed by John Bredemus & Perry Maxwell, Colonial Country Club is a tight Par 70 layout measuring 7,204 yards. It is very much a shot maker's course that rewards tee to green accuracy and course management will be key over the four days in Fort Worth.Tied 13th last week at the AT&T Byron Nelson to register his ninth top 25 finish of the season, Dufner opened with rounds of 69, 68 and 65 at the Four Seasons Resort in Dallas. The American was tied 14th at The Honda Classic in February before posting three top 12 finishes at the Valspar Championship, Shell Houston Open and RBC Heritage.
Dufner  ->  positive

Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
Cameron Smith  ->  negative

Certainly less of a household name than the previous mentions, the 28-year-old really should have secured his maiden victory last week when leading inside the back-9 before an incorrect swing led to a double-bogey on 16. Impressive for the three early rounds, Hoge comes here with a 7th in last season’s afore-mentioned Shriners and, to confirm last week’s third-round effort in the wind, has enough in his record in Texas and Puerto Rico. There is precedent of players ‘throwing’ away wins coming back to gain revenge soon after and at 100-1, he’s worth the poke.
Hoge  ->  positive

Of course, that's probably on the mind of every golfer in the field but Spieth usually accomplishes his goals. Dating back to last year's DEAN & DELUCA, Spieth has gained 3 or more strokes over the field in 16-of-17 PGA TOUR events. After an early-season struggle with the flat stick, he picked up 3.6 strokes putting at the Genesis Open.
Spieth  ->  positive

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 4 Winners:  2016: Justin Thomas (-23)  2015: Justin Thomas (-26)  2014: Ryan Moore (-17)  2013: Ryan Moore (-14)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Par 4 Scoring Fairways Hit GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Justin Thomas ($12,300)  Who else to begin with the two-time defending Champion, Justin Thomas? JT is now the 4th ranked golfer in the world, and it’s largely in part to his terrific summer where he enjoyed a pair of wins at the PGA Championship and Dell Technologies Championship, before a 2nd place finish at the TOUR Championship to earn him the FedEx Cup Title.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

What was encouraging at Torrey Pines is in addition to his normal tee to green strengths Harris actually topped the scrambling stats for the week and if he can keep these numbers going whilst getting one or two more putts to drop another big finish is on the cards. Finally further encouragement is given in English’s recent record at TPC Scottsdale which includes two top 10s in the past 4yrs. SCOTT PIERCY – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  Unsurprisingly for a man who spent his college days at UNLV Piercy is something of a desert golf specialist and any time he comes in to a desert event in any kind of form he is one for the short list.
Harris  ->  positive

Seamus Power  3. Sam Saunders  MY PICK : Ollie Schniederjans ($8,500)  Ollie got off to a great start in Hawaii (T7 at Sony Open) but ultimately made one too many mistakes to be a factor for the win there. He’s made it a point, however, to make getting his first win a priority this year, and this venue seems like it should suit him just fine for those purposes.
Ollie  ->  positive

Russell Henley  ->  positive

His profile as a long hitter shadows the fact that he's actually the total package. Billy Horschel has a glowing track record in this tournament, but all of us might swerve if not for his T5 at the RBC Heritage. Conservative front-runners will still abstain because of his inconsistency, but the rest of us will latch onto his immediate success after returning to a putter of familiar length.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

I didn't want to go in to the event without a leftfield pick, so I've thrown a few pounds at Kyle Stanley at a huge price. Stanley missed the cut here on debut back in 2012 so that's a negative, as he hasn't been back since, but he was a winner on Tour last year, at the Quicken Loans National, and he's in fair form at present, having finished 25th in Mexico, 14th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and having reached the last eight at the WGC-Match Play two weeks ago. He's an extremely accurate player and a notoriously poor putter but his putting improves considerably on really fast greens.
Stanley  ->  positive

For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

He is also no stranger to Riviera Country Club, and like Leishman, had a solid finish in 2016, with a solo seventh, in which he had three rounds in the 60s. Reavie is not the biggest guy, and won’t be able to keep up off the tee with the aforementioned golfers, but his confidence is through the roof right now, which is more than enough reason for him to be deployed in a good amount of lineups. Sleeper for Cheaper  Jimmy Walker ($7,200)  It isn’t often that a player two years removed from winning a Major Championship can be considered a sleeper, but with his price down near the minimum ($6,600) Walker could be a sneaky play this week.
Reavie  ->  positive

He’s coming off another decent Masters, where he finished T28 and should be a popular pick this week. Russell Knox has really taken to Harbour Town. In his first four appearances here — over the past four seasons — Knox has finished T11-T2-T18-T9.
Knox  ->  positive

He's a strong cut-maker in most fields, and on this course (course history seems to matter here), he presents the upside we're looking for in tournaments. -- Taras Pitra  Charles Howell III  There are a lot of great options this week in the $7K range, but Howell is one of the most consistently solid performers. He has made the cut at Bay Hill in each of his past nine appearances while recording four top-25 finishes.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

He’s an easy play at this price. VALUE  Charley Hoffman ($7,900) – Sir Charles returns after his somewhat disappointing finish at Quail, and seeing as the course has tee boxes, fairways, and greens, there’s simply no way I won’t own at least some Charley Hoffman. He’s playing far too strong of golf for me not to want to a good bit of him, and I would expect that a return to his contending form is imminent.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Brandt Snedeker ($6,800): Announced Wednesday he had to withdraw due to rib issue. Fade: Phil Mickelson. I’m not confident in Rory, but he could turn things around completely at any moment.
Phil Mickelson.  ->  negative

His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
Walker  ->  negative

If he can keep it up – and he’s shown no signs of stopping – he’s easily one of the best values on the board this week. BARGAIN BIN  Bill Haas ($6,900) – In this range, you have to take what you can get, and I’ll gladly take the experience and track record of Bill Haas. Forget the British – it’s completely irrelevant here, and Haas has been pretty outstanding otherwise, including some rather strong finishes at this event over the past five years.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

The hardest part this week will be gauging the motivation for these top studs. If he’s motivated, Spieth is my pick to win. Looking at my recent strokes gained model, Spieth ranks seventh.
Spieth  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.

Top Course History Targets  Russell Henley  World Golf Ranking (#56)  Vegas Odds (33/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($10,200)  As the ninth most expensive golfer on DraftKings this week, Henley is going to be Top 3 in ownership and for good reason. He returns to the Houston Open with some amazing course history as he won the event last year and has finished Top 5 in three straight and Top 10 in four straight years.
Vegas  ->  positive

David was right in contention at the Travelers last week before falling back in the final round, but a return to a course where he made his web.com breakthrough in 2012 should see him right in the mix again this week. Result: T5  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here:  We all know that Billy Horschel likes a technical challenge and with a win at TPC Four Seasons last month allied to 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and another 4th at TPC Southwind on his last non-Major appearance, the Floridian has a real chance of being able to represent the United States for the first time as a professional in the Presidents Cup. A win this week would get Billy into the automatic qualification spots and on a course like TPC Potomac where hitting greens will be at a premium in the breezy conditions, I really like his chances.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

However, the other side of the argument is that by virtually every other measure he's playing close to his best at present and, unlike some, he'll be motivated to win regardless of the looming major championship. Part of the reason Mickelson loves this event is that Golf Club of Houston is set up to mimic Augusta, which means limited rough, dramatic, closely-mown run-off areas and slick, pure greens, and his comfort level across both courses is such that he's a strong fancy to go really close. At first in strokes-gained around the green and fifth in strokes-gained putting, Mickelson's short-game is razor-sharp right now and that means there's no need to experiment.
Mickelson  ->  positive

A T18 finish at the Masters two weeks was his third top-20 of the season, but his T9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions (reduced field) still remains his lone top-10. Walker was showing life ahead of the Masters, with three straight top-25’s, at the Genesis Open, Honda Classic and WGC – Mexico Championship, before lacklustre efforts at both the Match Play and the Shell Houston Open. Like his play this season, Walker’s record at TPC San Antonio is inconsistent, but is not without its highlights.
Walker  ->  positive

Kirk has been putting well enough - 47th Strokes Gained Putting - this season and sits inside our Putting Average 10-week tracker top 13, so it was interesting to see that his TPC Sawgrass performance a fortnight ago was driven by a great all-round showing. 6th for Ball Striking, 5th for Greens in Regulation and 5th for Putting Average generated Kirk's best ever finish at TPC Sawgrass and he also shot a -3/69 in the windiest conditions on Saturday. As we know with Chris, he often pops up with a win from very little (he has 4 PGA Tour wins) and Colonial has thrown up plenty of double winners over recent times including Kenny Perry (2003 & 2005) and Zach Johnson (2010 & 2012).
Kirk's  ->  positive

After going through the aforementioned process, I've changed my mind. Given my position (of power) in pursuit, I'm going with the modern-age horse for the course – Spieth. Rose could fill in the blank that Garcia doesn't later.
Spieth.  ->  positive

I don't think we need to go stars and scrubs this week in cash games but Rickie makes a very high upside GPP play and is the only player on my sheet to rank Top 10 in all four categories. Billy Horschel  World Golf Ranking (#81)  Vegas Odds (110/1)  Draftkings ($7,100)  FanDuel ($8,400)  If you are looking to take a risk and go a bit contrarian this week consider Billy Horschel. He comes back to PGA National with back to back Top 10 finishes in 2017 and 2016 but could be lower owned as the form has been pretty bad lately as he is coming off back to back missed cuts.
Vegas  ->  positive

With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week. Ian Poulter – Cash – DK: $8700 FD: $7400  Poulter continued his streak of good play at the Open Championship with a T14 finish. Poulter is among the elite in Shots Gained: Approach and Shots Gained: Scrambling this season which makes him a safe play and perfect for cash.
Poulter  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen ($7,200): Maybe the strangest price of anyone, Oosthuizen put together his third straight solid start last week and also had four rounds of par or better at the Honda—and also lead the field in Greens in Regulation percentage. Oosthuizen has been uber-solid off the tee in his last two starts ranking 8th and 11th for Driving accuracy respectively. One final link for Oosthy this week is the fact this course uses Kikuyu rough, grass often found in his home country of South Africa.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

I am willing to overlook his previous course form here, as I believe like others before him, he can put the past in his rear-view mirror on this course and get himself into contention for win number one. Chesson Hadley 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds) & 100/1 (Skybet 8 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Chesson Hadley is the one player who really jumps out at me this week and I was pleased to see he was three-figures. He had a very strong start to the season and has petered up and down in form since, with a missed cut last time out ensuring longer odds on him this week.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

With all this in mind, here are my selections for the 2017 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time.
Mickelson  ->  positive

For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico. This week, he will be the one standing with the trophy on Sunday evening.
Rory McIlroy.  ->  positive

While he had a bad missed cut at the Valero, he performed great at the RBC Heritage (on another Pete Dye course) where he ranked eighth in Strokes Gained: Approaches for the week, and also had a nice week at the team event on another Dye design, at the Zurich Classic. While I’m not expecting Poulter to win this week, a top 10 is very possible given his recent form and history at this venue and that sort of upside makes him an exceptional GPP target. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Poulter  ->  positive

He’s shown great success at TPC Boston and he’s going to be an elite option in all formats this weekend. Sergio Garcia ($9500)  So, I may have just mentioned Adam Scott as my top overall play, but Sergio isn’t far behind. In fact, why don’t we call it even?
Sergio  ->  positive

Back William McGirt 2u @ [160.0]  Place order to lay 12u @ [15.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [3.0]  Back William McGirt for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ 7/2    First up, a player who is fast becoming a favourite of this column. William McGirt has earned us a profit once, and gave us a great run at the Phoenix before a frustrating final day collapse cost us that top 20 payout. By setting a lay order to partially cash out should he shorten up in-play, a similar scenario could still yield a profit.
William McGirt  ->  positive

2nd at Glen Oaks, 2nd at TPC Boston and a fast-finishing 7th at Conway Farms last week where he finished with a bogey-free -6/65, Jordan has the kind of momentum recent winners of the FEC have had. Spieth only made 4 bogeys all week, was 3rd for Greens in Regulation and his scrambling was as good as we have seen since the Open Championship. He tops my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker and he's the Number 1 in this week's Published Predictor Model.
Jordan  ->  positive

Johnson has finished inside the top-23 in six of his seven starts this season, with the T57 finish at the Phoenix Open the exception. This suggests Johnson’s game is in very good shape, and an improvement in one area could be the difference on any given week. Zach has always been known for his short-game and in particular his putting, but so far this season he currently ranks just 81st in Strokes Gained: Putting, and should he find his touch on the greens, a win could be on the horizon.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

We saw Webb Simpson - like Bradley, another recent major champ who has had to come to terms with the new putter rule - come within an inch of winning at TPC Scottsdale so it's fair to presume these hugely talented players who tasted big success early have more wins in them. Getting Bradley at 80/1 is a bonus. I also looked at California native Brendan Steele at 66/1 but he does get in his own way mentally a bit.
Bradley,  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan and Graham DeLaet are both shorter than 20/1 at the head of the outright market this week and with neither having won on the PGA Tour, I am more than happy to side with Scott Brown who is available at 33/1 with Betfred and Bet Victor.The New Zealander is starting to find a little form again on the PGA Tour and he heads to Puerto Rico on the back of consecutive top 25 finishes in Florida. Tied 22nd in the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook, Lee closed with a final round of 67 last week to finish 17th at the Arnold Palmer Invitiational. The 26-year-old was 7th at the Valspar in 2015 before going on to win his maiden PGA Tour later that year at The Greenbrier Classic.
Lee  ->  positive

11th here in 2014 featured rounds of 63-70-68-69 and Cauley was 2nd after firing that -7/63 and was 7th going into Sunday. I also like his love for Pete Dye designs (Dye re-designed this course back in 1982) which is something that runs across Knox/Streelman/Duke and even Bubba Watson (a winner at TPC Louisiana). Cauley was 3rd at the CareerBuilder Challenge back in January which features the Dye Stadium Course as the host venue plus he's also finished 9th at Harbour Town, 5th (in partnership with Justin Thomas) and 11th at TPC Louisiana.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Marc Leishman e.w. @ 22/1  I certainly considered 28/1 shots Brian Harman and Pat Perez for my second pick. Harman scrambles and putts well and ended 2017 with form of 5-8-4.
Harman  ->  positive

Instead I take stock from his Augusta outing where after a Saturday -6/66 the Englishman was in 6th spot after 54 holes. Ultimately he disappointed slightly in the 3rd-last pairing with Henrik Stenson, but following on from his U.S. Open heroics last year, it's clear that Fleetwood can mix it at the very highest level. We all know that a first win in America is always a huge goal and Fleetwood arrives at a Quail Hollow course he played well enough at the PGA Championship last term with real momentum.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

I have a feeling he will be chalky, but I will look to differentiate elsewhere and keep my rose exposure. Jordan Spieth ($11,100) – We all know how well Jordan plays at Augusta every year and this is an Augusta-like course in Texas. Where is Jordan Spieth from – Texas.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The price is going up but I think we can still consider him in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Chesson Hadley  World Golf Ranking (#80)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,000)  FanDuel ($8,700)    After losing his Tour card in 2016, Hadley won twice on the Web.com Tour last year and is back with the big boys and looking good. He started the fall season with three straight Top 5 finishes before withdrawing from the OHL Classic(illness).
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Pro Subscribers can review ownership trends via our DFS Ownership Dashboard shortly after lineups lock. The Value Plays  It’s a loaded field, which means that Adam Scott ($8,800) and Paul Casey ($9,000) are underpriced and likely to be incredibly chalky. Scott has two top-10 finishes over his last three trips here; his 68.4 Course Adj Rd score is the third-best mark among golfers with more than one visit.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Initial thoughts are 'probably not' but he does have a second (Scottish Open) and a 10th (Irish Open) on windy links and also recent knowledge that he can take on the best after finishing runner-up in the US PGA. Tommy Fleetwood - 25/1  The market may just be underestimating Fleetwood here. He's the new European No.1 and topped the greens in regulation stats when enjoying that new status with a tied sixth place in last week's Hong Kong Open.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

What is most impressive about Henley’s record this year might be his performance in the years first two majors as he recorded his best ever finish at Augusta with a T11 and was in contention at the U.S. Open until a subpar final round. While he doesn’t have an extensive Open record, Henley has tended to play well on wind-exposed courses before (he has wins in Hawaii and Florida) and did record a top-20 finish at the Open back in 2015 at the Old-Course. He also currently ranks 17th in Par-4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards, a stat which may translate well to success on Birkdale’s tougher par 4s.
Henley’s  ->  positive

All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he'll be in contention. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour.
Cantlay  ->  positive

The PGA Tour stays in Florida for this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational and Dave Tindall has three bets for the showdown at Bay Hill where eight-time winner Tiger Woods heads the market...  "This is a venue where past course form seems to count for more than average and Rose has a second in 2013, a third in 2011, an eighth in 2006 and, most recently, T13 (2017) and T9 (2016) the last two years." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Justin Rose e.w. @ 14/1  Presuming his form was decent, backing Tiger Woods at the courses where he's had most success would have seemed a decent strategy when he set out on his 2018 comeback.
Rose  ->  positive

He knows if he wants to do something special, he has two more chances: East Lake and the Ryder Cup. Jordan Spieth. Look, if he didn’t have to compare his season to the monster one he put together a year ago, Spieth would be just fine.
Jordan Spieth.  ->  positive

You're banking on consistency but if a putting contest breaks out he'll also be in the mix as he ranked ninth in putts per round on the Web.com Tour last year. Lucas Glover ($8,900): While the last three golfers are relative young pups, Glover keeps things in the SEC but also brings some maturity. The Clemson product had an incredible bounce-back year in 2016, and what better way to end it then playing on a short track with bermuda greens.
Glover  ->  positive

16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. RESULT: T73  Chesson Hadley 2pts EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I always like Chesson Hadley when he's on a roll and like Luke List he's certainly a player who deserves a victory this season.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

The “choker” label was shedded at the Dean & DeLuca, and this par-4 stud should be able to post a score of at least -16 over four days which may not end up winning but will be a great DK score and necessary in a winning lineup in a weak field. Brian Harman ($10900) – Guaranteed to have some chalk behind his name, this past champion has had some great form this year which showed itself to a worldwide audience at Erin Hills with a T2 finish to go along with his earlier win at the Wells Fargo. Those two factors along with the overall weakness of the field means Harman will probably be the chalkiest player this week, but he also has some of the highest win upside both statistically and based on his past performance in Illinois: three top-25s (including that win in 2014) to go with two missed cuts in five total tries.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

When my two favorite darts are Martin Flores and Nick Watney, it’s probably time to log out.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

All of that bodes well when it comes to his prospects on debut at Glen Abbey, where the unpredictability of scoring conditions is no issue for a player whose wins have come in 12- and 21-under. English has suffered a difficult 2017, but he’s been able to perform at some of those courses I’ve mentioned and to be honest it’s amazing he’s made any cuts at all given how abysmal he’s been off the tee, which played a part in his making an 11 at the Travelers last month. However, there was a noted step up on his latest start when T29 at the Greenbrier, where English made gains off the tee in every round, eventually ranking 19th in the field.
English  ->  positive

4th at the 2014 U.S. Open held at Pinehurst Number 2 also jumps off the page as the top 4 in that tournament include Martin Kaymer (2014 Players Champion), Rickie Fowler (2015 Players Champion) and Jason Day (2016 Players Champion). A dead-cert for the Ryder Cup European side in my view whatever the circumstances, I'm also a believer that the fact that Stenson sits outside of the automatic spots will be another motivating factor this week on a course he knows intimately. RESULT: T23  Bryson DeChambeau 1pt EW 55/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds.
Stenson  ->  positive

Bryan is going to win on Tour this year, and the PRO could be just the place to get the job done. Luke List ($9,900) – Speaking of breakthroughs, List might be the most talented player in the field without a PGA Tour win. He had a red hot Fall Swing and has been playing decently in 2017 as well.
Luke List  ->  positive

Kim has already notched two impressive wins, and a win here can get his 2018 off to a huge start. Chris Kirk 125/1 (Betfred & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  For the past year or so, Chris Kirk has struggled and his last win came in May 2015, but I am expecting the four-time PGA Tour winner to turn it around, hopefully as soon as this week. Kirk was one of the players to make the switch to PXG in 2016 and that may well be attributed to his struggles, but in recent starts he looks to be on an upward curve in terms of form.
Kirk  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the John Deere Classic - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 22/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Turning the clock back 2 years to 2015, Jordan Spieth won this event in a play-off from Tom Gillis with the very much in-form Danny Lee and Zach Johnson only a shot behind. Spieth was a 4/1 shot, with Zach Johnson at 11/1 and Danny Lee 80/1.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

I think some skepticism remains, which will keep his ownership in check a tiny bit. Alexander Noren – $9,200  The price tag is too cheap for Alex Noren, who ranks 1st in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds. He has been super consistent this season, proving his success on the European Tour is far from a fluke.
Noren  ->  positive

In a field where it’s hard to find players to roster in the $7k range without eating so much chalk you can’t breathe, Jones offers a nice GPP alternative who saves you some salary, has good potential to make the cut and has roughly 100:1 odds to win the tournament this week. The other standout this week is probably one who will indeed be chalky but is probably worth the dry taste in your mouth in Adam Hadwin who comes in with a $6,900 price tag and nearly 70:1 odds to win the tournament. Despite what I expect to be a popular play in Hadwin, I think this is a spot to get a guy who clearly has the game to win the tournament and is as inexpensive as they come in that category.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

He missed the cut last week in team play, but before that made five in a row including a T23 at the Shell Houston Open. J.B. Holmes ($8000): Holmes is another golfer that’s typically been long off the tee throughout his career, and is currently sitting with the longest Carry Distance at a whopping 305.7 (overall distance of 300.3, good for 26th) which will be a big factor here as mentioned. The PGA’s version of the Ginger Hammer (apologies to Roger Goodell) has made eight of nine cuts this season, and is coming into the week off a T5 in the team play last week.
Holmes  ->  positive

(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street. The 2017 Greenbrier Classic and Tour Championship champion, Schauffele has been inevitably quieter in 2018 but he's still playing some excellent golf. 17th at TPC Scottsdale, 9th at Riviera, 18th at Chapultepec and his WGC Dell Match Play campaign was ok too, beating Frittelli and Sharma before being beaten by Sergio Garcia.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

With the way things have been going for the rookie, I would have no issues running him out in cash games this week and is definitely in play for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark. Surely, he's entitled to be closer to the front of the market and he's a strong each-way fancy.
Johnson  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  MY PICK : Martin Kaymer ($9,500)  Martin Kaymer hasn’t won since his victory at the U.S. Open in 2014, but he does have a great streak of 28 starts without a missed cut going and should generally be considered the class of a fairly weak field this week. While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence.
Kaymer  ->  positive

This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Morgan  ->  positive

Bud Cauley at 100/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – gone nicely here before and bagged another top-10 finish last week  1pt e.w. Harold Varner III at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – took to the course last year and in better form now  There’s been something for everyone over the years since the Valero Texas Open found its home at TPC San Antonio, but this bulky par 72 lends a definite advantage to big hitters, standing it in stark contrast to last week’s event by the coast in South Carolina. Last year, Charley Hoffman finally converted his unquestionable comfort levels here by holding off Patrick Reed to win by one, completing a double of Greg Norman-design victories having previously stumbled over the line in Mexico at the OHL Classic.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

Next stop Korea. — Ian Poulter (@IanJamesPoulter) October 15, 2017  He said as much at the British Masters, telling reporters there that returning to the world's top 50 and earning a place in next week's field is his main objective, and perhaps he can draw from it to get into contention here. Poulter has never been particularly effective in Kuala Lumpur so his moderate performance there is not much of a concern, especially as he saved his best until last with a five-birdie 31 across his final nine holes.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Blayne Barber and Zac Blair are two straight-hitting youngsters set to enjoy a productive week but a bit of nous tends to count for plenty here and that's also part of the reason for overlooking Morgan Hoffmann, who is typically an accurate driver and good putter and knows this course really well. Instead, I'll throw a dart in the direction of 41-year-old Ian Poulter at the same price as Herman. Poulter has made the cut on all six visits to Harbour Town, while for a brief time in the 2012 PGA Championship at Kiawah Island it looked like he might lay down a stern challenge to Rory McIlroy.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Sticking with our "studs and duds" approach this week, you can fit Na, Johnson, and Steele in a lineup and have and average of $7,233 left to spend on your three remaining spots.

He sits 17th in overall driving accuracy (68.23%), but he actually hits the fairway a whopping 83% of the time. Stanley hasn’t performed well here historically so should go under-owned relative to his talent.

Rory McIlroy - $11,800 (7-1)    One way for Spieth to relieve some of that pressure was to say that McIlroy is the favorite. That's smart of Spieth, and calculating, but also probably true. McIlroy has won at Quail Hollow twice with six top-10s in seven career starts there.
Spieth  ->  positive

I thought 125/1 for 6 places (1/5 odds) or 90/1 for 8 places (1/4 odds) were fair prices given his two top-4 finishes in the majors last year, and the four-time PGA Tour winner has been playing some of the best golf of his career in the last couple of years. Along with his solid record in majors (now finished T24 or better in all four), Holmes has a 2nd at the 2015 WGC Cadillac Championship on his resume, showing he can do it on the biggest of stages. Total Points Staked this week: 8  Profit/Loss for 2017: -38
Holmes  ->  positive

So, instead, I'll jump down to the three-figure prices and try a punt on Sam Saunders at 125/1. Asked recently what his grandfather, the great Arnold Palmer, might say about his recent play, Saunders replied, "Something like, it's about time you won." He'd made a similar point himself at the start of the year.
Sam Saunders  ->  positive

Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75. He’s an excellent play this week.
Steele  ->  positive

Ogilvy comes into North Carolina on the back of three top-30 finishes in his last four starts and he’s had success when he’s made the trek to North Carolina in the past, having made the cut in 10 out of 11 appearances at this event. Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well. While he’s more of a GPP play, Ogilvy is a player you can target given his improved recent form (13th overall in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green at the Valero) and affinity for this event/region.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

He’s never missed a cut in six appearances at PGA National with four T10s in his last five starts. Donald doesn’t fit the prototypical player I said I’d be focusing on, however he’s starting to flash the skills that brought him to prominence in the first place. The elite putting (6th), short (35th), and sand (5th) game has returned, and he’s cleaning up on Par 3s (21st) at the moment.
Donald  ->  positive

Brian Gay  3. Danny Lee  MY PICK : Kevin Chappell ($9,400)  Chappell had a slow start to the season, but over the past few weeks, he has seen a big resurgence in his game. While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam. UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience.

Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Rose came into the 2017 Masters winning just once in 2016 at the Olympic Games in Rio, but this time has three wins under his belt already on the season. With some recent winning experience fresh in the memory as well as some other top performances, you have to think Rose will be right in the mix on Sunday, in the quest for his first Green Jacket and the second major championship of his career. Rose clearly fits the bill here full stop but just from a statistical standpoint, Rose has dominated here at Augusta since 2012, as highlighted by this great nugget of information from Golf Channel’s, Justin Ray below.
Rose  ->  positive

Salary Vs. Vegas Odds  While I don’t suggest making decision based purely on Vegas Odds when it comes to golf, I think it’s a useful way to determine where you might find golfers with unexpected value. The first standout this week comes in the form of Lucas Glover who’s odds are roughly 100:1 to win despite the fact that Glover will cost you only $6,600 towards the salary cap to get him in your lineups. Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play.
Glover  ->  positive

Knox is 18th in GIR, 28th in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green, and 27th in SG Around the Green. Russell Knox makes for a sneaky tournament play and his course history provides a safe floor if you choose to roll him out in cash games. Francesco Molinari ($7,500) has the best win probability of anyone priced under $8,800.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Again taking the last seven winners as a sample, Woodland & Donald had both finished 6th in their previous starts in Florida, Spieth had finished 17th & 7th in his two previous starts, Hadwin had not missed a cut all season and had come close to winning at the Career Builder and Charl had won twice on the European Tour that year already and had finished 17th at Doral the week before. The clues were less obvious from Streelman and Senden, although Senden had only missed one cut all season and Streelman did have a top 10 to his name earlier in the year. All in all though it would seem what you should look for at Copperhead is a player who is in control of all parts of his game coming in to the event.
Streelman  ->  positive

Finau has been close to breaking out with a win a few times (sorry, I don’t count the Puerto Rico Open), and this seems like an ideal course/field for him to finally make it happen. Other Options: Matt Kuchar (Cash), Charley Hoffman (GPP)  Mid-Tier Targets:  JB Holmes (DK: $8,500, FD: $8,600)    JB is a much better value on DraftKings, but this a course that should suit him perfectly. Holmes is one of the biggest bombers in golf and has a great short game, as well.
Holmes  ->  positive

A 2016 win at the Jones Cup Invitational played at Ocean Forest Golf Club on Sea Island, Georgia is also interesting. Players such as Justin Thomas, Patrick Reed, Jordan Spieth, Victor Dubuisson, Paul Dunne and Austin Connelly all feature in the winners list of this strong amateur event, with a couple of those featuring at Birkdale last July. 2015 saw the then amateur Hossler finish 58th at the U.S. Open hosted at Chambers Bay and since his promotion to the PGA Tour, Beau has shown serious signs by the coast.
Patrick Reed,  ->  positive

The same goes for Morgan Hoffmann, whose (reasonably) nearby residence in Jupiter surely played some part in another place at a massive price in Florida last time out. Like Cauley, he was once one of the bright young things of US golf and is tempting enough at 200/1, but consistency hasn’t been much of a strong suit in the past and the feeling is that particular ship has sailed. Some would say that comment applies to Jim Furyk, but I can’t leave him out at 80/1 around this golf course.
Cauley,  ->  positive

He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
Adam Scott,  ->  negative

He is the most expensive golfer on both sites but with some of the excellent values down below and a 54-hole cut event, he can be used in all formats this week. Pat Perez  World Golf Ranking (#19)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($8,600)  FanDuel ($10.300)  Perez is back on American soil this week and returns to an event he has been very comfortable at over the years. He has made the cut here in six straight years including a T14 last year and two Top 10 finishes and has made the cut in 13 of his 15 trips to Pebble Beach.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Haas has excelled with his iron play and scrambling, both of which are keys this week. Haas has two top-5 finishes in five attempts at this venue, and I expect more of the same this week. His recent form is some of the best in the field: 12th, 25th, 5th, and 13th place finishes in his last four starts.
Haas  ->  positive

Mid-Priced  Jon Rahm ($8,600) – Since he joined the tour last year he has a Birdie or Better over 25, putting him in the company of players like Spieth and DJ, and that is exactly where he’s found himself on the leaderboard as well. Since his win at the Farmers Insurance Open in January, he has gone T16, T5, T3 and then followed that up with a loss in the finals of the Match Play Championship to Dustin Johnson, a match in which he battled to the very end. Brandt Snedeker ($8,000) – With four top-20 finishes at Augusta since 2011, and just one missed cut, Snedeker is someone who seems to at least have the ability to make some of the shots necessary to score at Augusta National.
DJ,  ->  positive

If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,900) Hadwin has been one of my go to guys all season and I am not going to let his lack of course history pull me off him now. It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field. Outside of the obvious names, Hadwin has been one of the better players on The Tour this season, sitting in 5th place in The FedEx Cup standings, making 10/11 cuts total, 7/7 in the new year, including a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge, a 6th at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, and an excellent win at The Valspar Championship.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

With a recent roll of honour that reads Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer, Spieth and Johnson, it is hard to veer too far away from proven performers at the very top of the sport. To that end, Rickie Fowler and Jon Rahm look ideal candidates as outright tips as they attempt to join Sergio Garcia as a maiden major championship winner in 2017. Rahm���������s whirlwind rise up the rankings has been incredible even by modern-day standards as we constantly hail the next big thing in the game every other month.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Ross Fisher, who finished alongside Rahm in third ranked second for GIR. If you did miss the small greens, recovering well was key also with Rahm and Fleetwood (tied third and second) ranking first and second for Scrambling. Is There an Angle In?
Rahm  ->  positive

Tony Finau ($6,500): Sticking with the theme from above, Finau also loves putting on bentgrass and saves us some salary. Rory McIlroy ($11,100) : He's still one of the best at racking up birdies (and eagles) in bunches when he's on his game. I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

He is riding a streak of three finishes of T26 or better and has missed just one cut so far this season. Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town.
Molinari  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

It absolutely burned me last year, but I’m going to go back to the well. Berger’s ball striking has been excellent the last month or so, and he is quickly emerging as a star of the future. I think that Berger will fly slightly under the radar with many looking towards Justin Thomas, Adam Scott and Tommy Fleetwood in this price range.
Berger’s  ->  positive

To my mind, Reed looks a prime candidate to emulate Rory and end a stop-start year by landing the jackpot over the next few weeks and he could start that here, defending his title on a new golf course which he's got the ability to adjust to immediately. Reed's record defending titles is strong - he's never been worse than 24th in four attempts, and almost won back-to-back renewals of the Tournament of Champions only to finish second - and with form at Firestone and Muirfield Village in the bag, he looks a solid alternative to the better-fancied runners, few of whom are more prolific. While The Northern Trust (formerly The Barclays) has thrown up some strange names in the top five and a totally shock winner in Heath Slocum eight years ago, Reed was the seventh successive high-class winner, every one of them either a Presidents or Ryder Cup player in their own right.
Reed  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Farmers Insurance Open. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brian Harman ($9,600)  Harman continues to play at a ridiculously high level. After five straight top-10 finishes, his streak snapped last week with a 20th at the CareerBuilder.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

He’s deadly accurate off the tee and with his irons, and obviously won’t be intimidated by anybody in this field. Justin Rose ($9,600) – Rose has two runner-up finishes at the BMW PGA Championship, and has won a British Masters at Woburn. When we look for accurate ball-strikers, he always comes to the forefront.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Whilst I wonder about Rahm on Bermudagrass greens, I have no hesitation in adding Rose to my betting slip this week as his record at the strategic East Lake is excellent. Jordan Spieth in his comments above notes that he thinks East Lake and Augusta have the same feel and twice Augusta runner-up Rose has finished 2nd (2012), 6th (2013), 4th (2014) and 2nd (2015) on his last 4 visits to the Tour Championship. This comment from Rose in an interview in 2012 backs-up the theory: "This is the kind of golf I do enjoy.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

JORDAN SPIETH – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – ¼ odds 1st 5 FINISHED 14th  The next player I like from a price point of view out of the market leaders is Jordan Spieth. Spieth’s troubles which have been mainly on the greens this season have been well documented. However last time out at the Genesis Open there were definite signs of encouragement in a performance which saw him finish 9th and register 17th on the strokes gained putting stats for the week.
JORDAN SPIETH  ->  positive

Also Consider: Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, J.B. Holmes  Dark Horse:  Lucas Glover ($8,600) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %.
Glover  ->  positive

The Phoenix Open in the main has always been the showground of the power players who can hit the ball high and close. J.B. Holmes (twice a winner), Hunter Mahan, Phil Mickelson (twice a winner), Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama all have plenty of pop from the tee when they need it. Kyle Stanley was a 305 yard average driver when he won here in 2013 and even Kevin Stadler in 2014 is not what you'd classify as a short driver of the golf ball.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Although the Sony Open is played on a completely different style of course, it's very common to find that good form in one Hawaii event is repeated in the other. So it also has to be good news that Kisner has finished fifth and fourth in his last two starts at Waialae. He's certainly worth looking at for that event next week but don't miss out on him here.
Kisner  ->  positive

He played great here last year shooting rounds of 68,68,66,66 to finish T6 and could easily improve on that this year. Its worth mentioning List has shot A 69 or better in 15 of his last 16 competitive rounds on the PGA Tour. Chez Reavie 66/1  Reavie is another player bang in form coming to California this week with two top 25’s and two top 10’s in his last five starts.
List  ->  positive

In just four starts here, over the last four years, he's finished 45th, seventh, fourth and fifth and his form so far in 2017 has been respectable enough. Billy Horschel's Greens In Regulation stats have been impressive of late and he'll feel he should have perhaps won here in 2013 when he was beaten into second by another of my fancies, last week's Puerto Rico Open winner, D.A Points. It's asking a lot for Points to double-up after last week but [200.0] was just too big and so too was the [250.0] I took about Cameron Tringale, who course form figures read a very respectable 73-8-16-4-5-57.
Points.  ->  positive

Cameron Smith, $9,300 – Smith started off with a trying 75 last week but reined it in the last three rounds as he climbed back into 17th. Dating back to the BMW Championship last season, Smith has put together four straight top-17 finishes and this week should offer him another chance to keep the good play going. Chris Kirk, $8,700 – Kirk posted a convincing fourth place at the RSM Classic in his last PGA Tour start, where he shot rounds of 63 and 64 in the first and third rounds.
Cameron Smith,  ->  positive

16th (2011), 5th (2012), 14th (2014), 1st (2015) and 15th (2016) highlights a player who enjoys this classical set-up and 66/1 with Betfred seems a little out of kilter for a player who's a 40/1 shot with plenty of other bookmakers. Kirk has been putting well enough - 47th Strokes Gained Putting - this season and sits inside our Putting Average 10-week tracker top 13, so it was interesting to see that his TPC Sawgrass performance a fortnight ago was driven by a great all-round showing. 6th for Ball Striking, 5th for Greens in Regulation and 5th for Putting Average generated Kirk's best ever finish at TPC Sawgrass and he also shot a -3/69 in the windiest conditions on Saturday.
Kirk  ->  positive

Looking at his statistics on the year (PGA only, doesn’t include his absurd 6-shot victory at the Irish Open), Rahm crushes in almost every key category:  4 th in Par-4 Scoring / 5 th in Par-5 Birdie or Better %  in Par-4 Scoring / 5 in Par-5 Birdie or Better % 20 th in Bogey Avoidance  in Bogey Avoidance 2 nd in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green 3 rd in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach  in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach 3rd from 175-200 yards / 90th outside 200 yards  The only categories that Rahm has struggled with this year is around the green (109th in strokes gained) and he’s only an above average putter, not an elite putter (59th). Although there are punitive bunkers around the greens, Rahm will still put himself either on the green or in great position so often that he can manage to give a shot or three back with poor sand save efforts. Play him with absolute confidence.
Rahm  ->  positive

His form through 2017 was quietly impressive with only one missed cut from the end of April to the end of the 2017 PGA tour season and after a couple of poor performances to start the 2017-18 season he signed of the 2017 PGA tour year with a 17th place at the RSM. As with Hadwin I feel the price on offer of 66-1 is more than fair.

Although getting all six of your golfers through the cut still holds value, it is not as important this week with the cut coming after 54 holes. Value Picks and Sleepers  Kevin Na ($8,800)  Na ranks third overall in our ranking system this week. He is a borderline top tier play at his $9,000 salary, but is on our radar as a "value play" because of the tremendous upside he offers.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

He’s now recorded three top tens in a row however and it has been mostly on the back of some great tee to green work which bodes extremely well for this week. Cauley has always been talented and this stretch of injury free golf may be finally what he needs to make the jump into a more elite tier of golfer. In a weak field, I’m not shying away from him as the confidence he’s built over the past month or so could easily lead to even better things here.
Cauley  ->  positive

What else of our selections last week? Stacey Lewis was placed in the Olympics at 14's and Snedeker and Rafa Cabrera-Bello both placed for us in The Wyndham at 33/1 and 40/1 Respectively, so whilst not winning we carry some decent place money forward this week. If you like what I do blog about why not check out my others for the football, golf and F1 here There is plenty of discussions on all of these topic over on the OLBG Forum pages (where you can win cash prizes so head over to the Forum for your chance to have a say.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Watching Phil over recent weeks I feel like I’ve been watching a loop of a tape where his putts keep hanging on the edge or burning the edges and if he can just get one or two more to drop this could at last be his week. PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price.
PATRICK CANTLAY  ->  positive

Prior to that he won the European Tour finale prior to the holidays, so this young gun is easily the cream of the crop this week in a semi-diluted field. Brian Harman, $11600 – Harman’s stock has gone up each of the past two weeks as he’s now posted four-straight top-5s dating back to last fall. The lefty is emerging as one of the most improved on the PGA Tour, and now feasts his eyes on the CareerBuilder Challenge, where he’s finished inside the top-11 the last two seasons.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

Well the season until recently has been the usual mixed bag from Si Woo which we have become accustomed to, however over the last couple of outings things have started to click in to place. Firstly Si Woo played well in the Matchplay to win his group before losing in the last sixteen. Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time.
Si Woo  ->  positive

Well rested and under the radar in a weaker field, Henley’s in a great spot to post his first big finish of 2017. MY SLEEPER : Cameron Tringale ($6,700)  Tringale is a hard player to get right, but he always brings upside for DFS. Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually.
Tringale  ->  positive

1 Jason Day No. 1, Back-to-back Top Five Finishes  While he failed to add to his major total in 2016, Day has succeeded in establishing himself as the PGA Tour’s most consistent threat to win. He nearly chased down Jimmy Walker at the PGA Championship last month, ending up in a tie for seventh, and he followed that up with a solid tie for fourth at The Barclays last week.
Day  ->  positive

Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.
Jim Furyk  ->  negative

Interestingly other than the 4th at the RSM Kirk’s best two 72 hole stroke play finishes of 2017 on tour came at this event where he finished 21st [on the back of a missed cut at the Sony] and at Sawgrass where he finished 18th. Kirk also has two other top 15 finishes at Sawgrass to show his liking for a Pete Dye design. Finally another point that caught my eye is that Kirk has a top 5 finish at the Nicklaus designed Muirfield village host of the Memorial, an event which has been won by Dufner and Lingmerth over recent years, who finished 1st & 2nd in this event respectively in 2016.
Kirk’s  ->  positive

Kirk  ->  negative

ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR. It was therefore with some amusement that those of us on this side of the pond watched the US lead coverage from Torrey Pines 3 weeks ago, during which we were treated to interviews and commentary that portrayed Alex as a complete rookie, who would potentially react like a rabbit in the headlights when faced with the possibility of winning on US soil!
Noren.  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 5 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at course history. Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
Bubba  ->  positive

He finished T12 on 2009, T23 in 2012, T15 in 2013, solo second in 2015, where he didnt shoot worse than a 67 throughout the week, and a T13 last year. Piercy ranks eighth in SG off the tee, ninth in SGTTG and tenth in SG Approaches to the green. With a great record here and good current form Piercy could be another player to keep an eye on here.
Piercy  ->  positive

The organisers tend to shape the draw so that the top players play consecutive rounds around Pebble on the weekend and if they do so again and Saturday ends up being really blustery, the current market leaders could get the worst of the draw. Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

His debut here in 2016 yielded an excellent top-10 finish after firing 66-64 heading into the weekend but the real selling point for me is Bryan’s ability when it comes to the second shot with a short iron in his hand, so important around here. Stick Bryan in the fairway in the region of 150 yards or closer and you have a player who can dial it in on a regular basis, a fact backed up this season with a very high ranking in all the relevant statistics in that department - to be honest, he is verging on deadly. His form has been inconsistent since that victory in mid-April but I expect an upturn returning to a course that plays to his strengths and could well give him a decent chance of quickly doubling his PGA Tour win tally.
Bryan’s  ->  positive

Ross Fisher, who finished alongside Rahm in third ranked second for GIR. If you did miss the small greens, recovering well was key also with Rahm and Fleetwood (tied third and second) ranking first and second for Scrambling. Is There an Angle In?
Rahm  ->  positive

Luke List looks incredibly short despite a good record at the course, and I'd rather take a chance on a man so easily confused with him, Jamie Lovemark. When An went closest to his breakthrough in Louisiana, so did Lovemark, somehow losing a play-off to Brian Stuard having missed a glorious opportunity to close the door in regulation. He's also had a chance to win here, leading through 54 holes in 2016, and one of the more powerful players on the circuit is clearly advantaged by a relatively low-scoring test on a par 72 which doesn't punish his wayward driving.
Jamie Lovemark.  ->  positive

USA 15, Australia 6, Continental Europe 5, England 4, Ireland 4, South Africa 2. Winning Scores and Stats in most recent Open at Royal Birkdale  2008 Open Championship  1 Padraig Harrington (DD: 45, DA: 37, GIR: 30, Scr: 13, PA: 4, AA: 7)  2 Ian Poulter (DD: 50, DA: 13, GIR: 7, Scr: 26, PA: 37, AA: 8)  3 Greg Norman (DD: 37, DA 76, GIR: 38, Scr: 3, PA: 21, AA: 22)  4 Henrik Stenson (DD: 18, DA: 4, GIR: 38, Scr: 4, PA: 31, AA: 1)  5= Jim Furyk (DD: 31, DA: 26, GIR: 5, Scr: 24, PA: 61, AA: 11)  5= Chris Wood (DD: 15, DA: 32, GIR: 38, Scr: 10, PA: 31, AA: 6)  Notes: Scrambling and All-Around do best. The modest GIR figures are surprising.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Last year he finished 32nd on tour in birdie average as well as T-29 in proximity to the hole on his approach shots. He should have plenty of looks at birdie this week, and I like him to make plenty of them  Martin Laird-  Laird finished T-8 at the Safeway Open in October and is another horse for the course with a win in 2009 followed by a 2nd place finish in 2010. He also came in T-18 in 2013 as well as T-43 last year.
Martin Laird-  ->  positive

From an identikit winner perspective, we're looking for a player who's comfortable on Bermudagrass greens, can hit the ball close with their approach play and who, when they win, shoot extremely low totals. The 23 year-old, University of Alabama produced Thomas ticks all of these boxes. Tough 3rd and 10th place finishes at PGA National and Copperhead last term show an aptitude for TifEagle greens and Justin is definitely Bermudagrass positive as he also has top 10 finishes across Waialae (his 2015 season opener in next door Honolulu), PGA West, Quail Hollow, TPC Sawgrass, East Lake and CC of Jackson.
Justin  ->  positive

I can’t be certain of course but he has a great track record of winning almost immediately again after a previous win and I would be kicking myself if I wasn’t on. ADAM SCOTT – 60-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 32nd  Adam Scott is undoubtedly one of the most frustrating golfers of recent times, however he is also one of the most talented and his ability to win big golf tournaments including Majors is not in doubt. He languishes in the betting market at around the 60-1 mark due to his lack of activity in general and certainly around the top of leader boards of late.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Molinari most recently posted his first top-25 of 2018 at the WGC-Mexico Championship, while he currently ranks 15th on Tour in SG: T2G and is top-10 in terms of proximity from 175-plus yards out. The Italian is 35-under-par in his last 20 rounds at the API, including three top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the event. Francesco Molinari - $13,800    Since 2010, Molinari is second to only Henrik Stenson in terms of overall scoring in relation to par at Bay Hill.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with 5 players this week as follows;  RICKIE FOWLER – 14-1 – 2pts Win FINISHED 11th  Whilst off course strong cases can be made for Rahm, Matsuyama and the other market leaders of those heading up the betting I like Rickie the most at the price. As much as Fowler has shown a dislike for Torrey Pines over recent years he has very much shown a liking for TPC Scottsdale and he undoubtedly has unfinished business here following his agonising loss in a play off to Hideki a couple of years ago. Take away the missed cut last week and Rickie has been in fantastic form since the back end of 2017.
Fowler  ->  positive

All of the last five winners ranked inside the top-12 for Putting Average with four of the five ranking inside the top-4, so clearly a strong putting week is required here also. The following events are the ones to have featured Bermudagrass Greens this season and should be looked at, in order to find those who have performed well on this putting surface this season:  Sanderson Farms  RSM Classic  Tournament of Champions  Sony Open  CareerBuilder Challenge  Phoenix Open  Honda Classic  The following players in the field this week have ranked inside the top-10 for Putting Average on more than one of these courses this season:  Chesson Hadley (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ollie Schniederjans (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Sam Saunders (x2) (T11 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ben Martin (x2) (T19 in Putting Average overall this season)  Aaron Wise (x2) (T27 in Putting Average overall this season)  Chris Kirk (x2) (T109 in Putting Average overall this season)  Gary Woodland (x2) (T151 in Putting Average overall this season)  It is clear from the list above that both Kirk and Woodland raise their game in a big way when on Bermuda Greens, whilst others on the list tend to be putting well all season. Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Matsuyama  ->  positive

He hasn’t been in the best form, but has played TPC Boston seven times and only once missed the cut, and is simply too good to be offered at this price. Fade: We give you Bubba Watson. Some places fit him, and some don’t.
Bubba Watson.  ->  negative

Haas has had trouble getting himself into contention in big events over his career but he landed his first top ten in a major last season (T9 at the Open) and has top-five finishes in two of the last three WGC events. Haas ranks high in some key stat areas for me as well, as he’s second in scrambling and ninth in par 4 scoring on the year. Kevin Kisner ($6,900): Kisner has had a great start to the 2017 season.
Haas  ->  positive

My biggest reservation here is that he would have to play DJ to get into the final 4, which would be less than ideal. However, Poulter is 23-14 in match play and can’t be counted as an easy out for anyone in the field. Marc Leishman ($8,600), 11 seed, Group 11.
Poulter  ->  positive

As the 146th Open gets underway this week in England, 156 hopefuls will compete for the right to be called Champion Golfer of the Year, and another chapter in the compelling and unpredictable history of this oldest major in golf will be written. Henrik Stenson aims to become the first player to successfully defend The Open title since Padraig Harrington did it in 2007 and 2008, and is joined by a marquee class of major champions including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott. Over the past decade, The Open has favored crafty veterans over young upstarts, with eight of the last 10 Open winners checking in at ages 33 or older.
Rory McIlroy,  ->  negative

While he has just one finish inside the top 10 at Augusta National, T11 and T12 in the last three years back up the idea that he'll always give you a run for your money in these markets on this course. Last four events: 43-14-37-MC  Course form: 11-MC-12-5-38-27-38  Last 10 majors: 5-22-5-11-33-46-MC-MC-30-30  Last 50 starts - Win: 2%, Top 5: 22%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  I couldn't quite pull the trigger on Justin Rose in the outright market but I have no hesitation making him my best top 10 punt here. Rose has the most robust greens in regulation stats at Augusta National of any player in the field this week and that will get you the top 10s.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Justin Rose 20/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Rose has not played since the FedEx Cup play-offs so comes into this week fresh from a run of form that saw him finish inside the top-10 in each of the four FedEx Cup play-off events with a 2nd and three 10th place finishes. There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off. Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He’s still riding the heater. DFS STRATEGY  Cash Games – There’s nothing wrong with starting your lineups with Jon Rahm ($11,800) here again. He’s started 2018 off perfectly.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
Stenson  ->  negative

If he can carry that form over to this week, he could well make an impact at the top of the leaderboard. Rose won the 2015 renewal of the Zurich Classic and also finished 4th at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits that same year, so he has some good recent form at Pete Dye designs. In terms of Par 4 Performance, Rose ranks 8th on Tour, and also 17th in Par 4 Efficiency 450-500 yards, which is an important range for this course.
Rose  ->  positive

Sang-Moon Bae ($7,200): Not many players have navigated their way around Riviera better than Sang-Moon, who has finished eighth, eighth and 12th in his past three trips: Bae’s 67.7 Course Adjusted Round Score ranks third among players with more than one start here. Finau missed the cut at the Phoenix Open his last time out and has missed the cut here at Riviera in each of the past two seasons, so despite his typically high ownership in Daily Fantasy Sports contests, Hump thinks Finau could fly under the radar this week. Tony Finau ($8,200): Finau hits it long (311.5 yard LT DD), puts the ball on the green (68.9 LT GIR percentage), and has been playing reasonably well (69.1 Recent Adj Rd Score).
Bae  ->  positive

An excellent ball-striker, Peterson led the field in greens as he finished inside the top 20 here on his last visit and, like Poulter, has been playing some good golf since returning from injury. Peterson's results have been more impressive, with two top-25 finishes in his last three starts, and perhaps with a baby on the way he'll find a level of calm on the course that has so far escaped this talented underachiever. Certainly, this is the type of test which was made for his game and a small each-way bet at 150/1 makes plenty of appeal in an event which tends to favour a very specific type of player.
Peterson  ->  positive

At 18th in the current United States team standings, Moore must know that he needs to put his foot to the floor over the next 3 weeks to get into Steve Stricker's thinking, but a pot full of points from last season's Tour Championship at East Lake where he finished runner-up to Rory McIlroy in turn grabbing Davis Love III's last Ryder Cup spot, plus the 3rd at this year's Tournament of Champions at Kapalua and 9th at The Masters, means that the Nevada man is still in touch with the likes of Matt Kuchar and Charley Hoffman when it comes to automatic qualification.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

It looks like he is well on track to start playing at the top of his game, and it showed during the first two rounds of the WGC where he was tied for third on the leaderboard entering the weekend.

The Canadian performed creditably in 36th on last year's Augusta debut and his short game excellence should ensure something respectable again...He's in reliable, consistent form, making every cut this year and finishing top-12 on four of his last six events." Wiesberger can continue impressive start  Back Bernd Wiesberger for a Top 40 Finish 8u @ 6/4  To a golf punter like myself - who will barely take his eye off the leaderboard all weekend, let alone the TV coverage - these distant finishing position markets are absolutely perfect. There are only 96 players at Augusta, dozens of whom have no chance whatsoever and most of whom I have a firm opinion.
Wiesberger  ->  positive

1 Jason Day No. 1, Back-to-back Top Five Finishes  While he failed to add to his major total in 2016, Day has succeeded in establishing himself as the PGA Tour’s most consistent threat to win. He nearly chased down Jimmy Walker at the PGA Championship last month, ending up in a tie for seventh, and he followed that up with a solid tie for fourth at The Barclays last week.
Jason Day  ->  positive

Thanks largely to his Mayakoba win, the runner-up finish at the Wells Fargo and a 3rd at this event last season, Perez finished 15th in the FedEx Cup standings which is by far and away his best performance since its inauguration in 2007. Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign.
Perez  ->  positive

6th at the 2012 Callaway Pebble Beach Invitational, he also finished 3rd here in his rookie 2013 PGA Tour season where he led after 54 holes. Confident with the putter right now, we know that Hahn can win on the classical courses like Riviera and Quail Hollow. He also has a great reason to be motivated this week: Hahn struggles in Florida, so at Number 60 in the OWGR, if he wants to get into The Masters it's pretty much now or Riviera next week.
Hahn  ->  positive

Since winning the Masters in April, Garcia has been able to back that win up with some strong play, including a T2 finish in his last start at the BMW International. Although he broke his major goose-egg at Augusta, it is the Open which has always been Garcia’s favorite major, as he has an incredible 10 finishes of T10 or better at this event since 2001. While younger players like Rahm and Spieth certainly come in with confidence, the Open has been an experienced player’s paradise recently with the last six winners all being 39 years of age or older.

All of them played at Kapalua last week, all are outsiders, and with the possible exception of James Hahn, all have form at correlating venues or Waialae. Selections:  Pat Perez @ [55.0]  William McGirt @ [80.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [110.0]  James Hahn @ [190.0]  Brian Stuard @ [200.0]  Mackenzie Hughes @ [300.0]    I'll be back on Thursday or Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter  You read fellow betting.betfair.com Golf columnist Dave Tindall's Sony Open Tips behind the link.
Fabian Gomez  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama 10/1 (General) 3pts win  It feels so ridiculous tipping Matsuyama, it feels even more ridiculous that he’s 10/1. In Matsuyama’s last 10 Worldwide starts he has five wins, eight top-5’s of which 2 were runner-up finishes. He has elevated his game to a completely different level and until he shows signs of slowing up, it is hard to bet against him, no matter where the venue.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Those with a top three are bolded up. Patrick Cantlay, Paul Casey, Kevin Chappell, Jason Day, Bill Haas, Dustin Johnson, Matt Kuchar, Marc Leishman, Phil Mickelson, Kevin Na, Louis Oosthuizen, Pat Perez, Jon Rahm, Chez Reavie, Patrick Reed, Justin Rose, Webb Simpson, Jordan Spieth, Robert Streb, Justin Thomas, Jhonattan Vegas  Of those above 21 players, the one with the best course form is Jason Day so, in a move that squeezes out every last drop of the bleeding obvious, it's the Aussie that is my number one pick. History tells us that it pays dividends to keep it simple at this time of year so Day, who boasts a victory in 2015 (by six shots!)
Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

The Tiers  $12,000 - $10,000  CASH: He was our GPP play last week but this week for cash I am going straight to the top with Jordan Spieth. Spieth comes into Pebble with great form having posted a 9th last week after getting off to a rocky start was able to find his groove and surge on the weekend with two prior 3rd places in the fall.. Jordan's game is well suited for this event and he is sneaky long enough to hit the big par 5's in two. After getting his irons and wedges dialed in on the weekend at the Waste Management, I'm confident he will be throwing darts on this rain soften course.
Jordan  ->  positive

What's really caught my eye though is Hahn's recent putting form which sees him sitting 9th in my rolling 10-week Putting Average tracker. Rounds of -5/65 and a closing -8/62 powered Hahn into a play-off in last month's Sony Open where he was outlasted by Patton Kizzire. Last week on a home Scottsdale track that he likes, James finished 11th with -4/67 and -5/66 rounds across Friday and Saturday powering the Californian through the mid-pack.
James  ->  positive

I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag. While I don’t love McGirt’s chances to win this thing, I definitely thing he has top 10 upside and is probably worth taking a hard look at in GPPs.
McGirt  ->  positive

With some recent winning experience fresh in the memory as well as some other top performances, you have to think Rose will be right in the mix on Sunday, in the quest for his first Green Jacket and the second major championship of his career. Rose clearly fits the bill here full stop but just from a statistical standpoint, Rose has dominated here at Augusta since 2012, as highlighted by this great nugget of information from Golf Channel’s, Justin Ray below. Reasons to like @JustinRose99 this week: – Most birdies/eagles made at ANGC since '12  – Highest GIR% in Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 5 score to par at Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 4 scoring avg at Masters last 5 years  – Best score to par overall in Masters since 2011 — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) April 2, 2018  He may only be 14/1 this week but when we talk of the word “overdue”, nothing quite personifies it like Rose at Augusta.
Rose  ->  positive

If you can't quite see Tiger getting it done, a top 5 or top 10 punt could be a very good way of cheering him on. Last four events: 5-2-12-MC  Course form: 17-4-40-4-4-6-2-2-3-1  Last 10 majors: MC-MC-MC-17-MC-69-40-6-32-4  Last 50 starts - Win: 10%, Top 5: 26%, Top 10: 34%    Justin Rose - Place machine looks ready to play  "I really have positive and fond memories of last year. I hit a lot of great shots, and I don't feel like it was a tournament that anybody lost really," said Rose on Monday when reflecting on last year's play-off loss to Sergio Garcia.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Paul Casey at 40/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) - has both recent & course form  1pt e.w. Mackenzie Hughes at 300/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - big price about a player who knows this course well  Click here for our transparent tipping record  Three years ago, Rory McIlroy won the Open Championship and followed up at the Bridgestone Invitational before completing a tremendous hat-trick in the PGA Championship at Valhalla. Jordan Spieth now has the Claret Jug safely stashed away and is 8/1 favourite to double his haul at Firestone in Akron, Ohio, after a truly remarkable final few holes at Royal Birkdale.
Mackenzie Hughes  ->  positive

Indeed, when third here nobody hit more greens and nobody hit the ball closer. While Oosthuizen still seeks his first win in the US, Schwartzel has two and although frustrating at times, he's playing well enough to be a major factor here. In his last 10 starts, the former Masters champion has three top-six finishes and all in strong fields.
Schwartzel  ->  positive

Last Five Winners  2017 - Dustin Johnson -17  2016 - Bubba Watson -15  2015 - James Hahn -6 (playoff)  2014 - Bubba Watson -15  2013 - John Merrick -11 (playoff)  What Will it Take to Win the Genesis Open? The general perception is that length off the tee here is very beneficial and last year's winner, Dustin Johnson, did rank number one for Driving Distance but the average DD ranking of the dozen winners before him was a fairly lofty 24.75 and in each of the last six years at least one player has placed with a DD ranking of 50th or higher. Kevin Na and Wesley Bryan tied for fourth 12 months ago ranking 56th and 66th for DD and James Hahn ranked 50th when he won the event three years ago.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

He's got 10 million reasons to play well. Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017.
Spieth  ->  positive

The Travelers Championship tees off from TPC River Highlands in Connecticut, so here are a few names to consider from every price point. High-Priced  Jordan Spieth ($11,400) – Obviously Spieth, McIlroy and Day – the three top options on the board – have the upside of carrying you to a fantasy title, but each has enough variance in their game to make them more of a tournament play right now. All three should probably find their way into a lineup or two, but of them, Spieth is my favorite right now.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bill Haas ($9,500): Haas is coming in off a two-week rest and he needed it apparently as he missed the cut by a mile his last time out at the Heritage. Still, Haas has been consistent most of the season, with the RBC being his only missed cut over seven starts. With his recent third place at the WGC Match Play event still semi-fresh, I won’t be shocked if Haas puts the confidence gained there to good use this week in a much weaker field.
Haas  ->  positive

I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
Ian Poulter:  ->  negative

Expectations have to be tempered until he shows the same sort of form in bigger events, so a Top-20 bet looks the more realistic option this week but this could well be a breakout year, should he put together a couple of good weeks early. Tom Jacobs – Jason Kokrak to be the First Round Leader 55/1  This is a simple one for me. Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early.
Jason Kokrak  ->  positive

If Piercy takes to this layout - and I strongly suspect that he will - and produces the level of golf he displayed in four of his previous five starts this year, he seems likely to go very close. There are dangers, of course, but when Rory Sabbatini, Graeme McDowell and Harris English are among them, it's clear that we're talking about an exceptionally weak event, the like of which Piercy has won twice before. McDowell was on the radar for all the obvious reasons - his form by the coast, the improvement he's shown over the last month, his handy knack of actually winning golf tournaments - but 25/1 looks about right, although he represents better value than Sabbatini at the prices.
Piercy  ->  positive

He drained 27 birdies at this track last year and finished T8. Zach Johnson ($6,300): This is probably the first and last time you’ll see Johnson as the cheapest golfer in the field. Zach hasn’t finished better than 33rd in his last seven tournaments, but he could make his way into a lot of lineups this week for those looking to load up on the expensive studs.
Johnson  ->  positive

Jason Rouslin -- Kevin Kisner ($6,900)  Arriving in Shanghai off a decent performance in Malaysia, Kisner comes to China and the Sheshan International Golf Course where he placed second last year. With that in mind, and a great value, I like Kisner to jump start his 2016-2017 season with a top 10 finish this week. Kisner sports a great tee-to-green game and is a great driver of the golf ball.
Kisner  ->  positive

2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014. RESULT: T5  Kelly Kraft 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Kelly Kraft is another I like on the basis that he's been showing some decent enough form which hasn't scared the odds compilers too much and has a nice habit of late of playing well in the wind.
Kelly Kraft  ->  positive

This season Keegan has already finished in the top 5 twice and he has ticked along nicely in the Florida swing with three solid performances. Bradley’s long game stats this season are mightily impressive and he currently sits 4th in Ball Striking on the PGA Tour. Not unsurprisingly for someone who was hit badly by the anchored putting ban, the area holding him back so far from revisiting the winners enclosure is the putter and to date this year Bradley sits 207th out of 214 listed players in the PGA tour’s Strokes Gained Putting stats.
Bradley’s  ->  positive

Zach Johnson should go well after another promising effort last week  Johnson remains an above-average putter, but it's a while since he's been a deadly one and combined with the fact that he cannot overpower any golf course, that explains why too often he's been on the fringes of contention without adding to his impressive haul of 12 PGA Tour wins. Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

The other notable absentee is former winner Adam Scott, who is done for the PGA Tour season, but otherwise this is an elite list and, as you'd expect, a top-heavy market. Hideki Matsuyama probably deserves favouritism given the six titles he's won since this event last year, but picking between him, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas and Henrik Stenson isn't easy. McIlroy might even shade my vote as he's more than twice the price he started the PGA Championship, where he finished inside the top 30 don't forget, and he brings form from all those courses mentioned to the table.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Reavie ranks 7th and 9th in approaches from the fairway in these two ranges respectively, further supporting his case this week. Whilst there are obvious question marks about whether Reavie can win, especially in this company, his game is in perfect shape to play this course. Despite the obvious positives, aside from a 7th place finish in 2016, his record here makes dismal reading.
Reavie  ->  positive

His past history in this event is tempting, but there are too many other healthy horses to saddle this week. Jim Furyk – His record in this event sounds like he’s an automatic, but his current form screams the opposite. Big ballpark, and recent struggles makes Oakmont feel like it was a very long time ago in his native Western Pennsylvania.
Jim Furyk  ->  negative

He is probably too risky for cash games but is an excellent, high upside GPP play. Who the Stat Like  Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#74)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,100)  I already talked about Hadwin and Steel who rank #1 and #3 in my overall model so we will jump right to the guy in the middle of them, Tony Finau. Looking at the field ranks for this week, Finau is 1st in SG: OTT, 2nd in SG: OTT + APP, 5th in Driving Distance, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd and 14th in GIR from 175-200 and 200+ and 15th in both Bogey Avoidance and Birdie or Better %.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there. As he sits 21st in Par 4 Scoring Average, it makes sense that he plays well on courses with two extra ones.
Bradley's  ->  positive

With only two Par 5s in play this week, Par 4 Scoring and Par 3 Scoring get a boost in the key stat department. Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Bogey Avoidance (BA), Par 4 Scoring, Approaches 125-150 yards, Scrambling, Par 3 Scoring  Top-Tier Plays  Jordan Spieth ($10,800)  Could this finally be the year Spieth takes down his hometown tournament? Spieth accepted invitations to play as an amateur in the Byron Nelson in 2010 and 2011 and finished a respectable 16th and 32nd.
Spieth  ->  positive

On top of this all Harman finished T5 at this event at Bethpage Black in 2012 and impressed again four years later, finishing T22 at the same course and event. With the Bethpage Black form behind him and some solid current form, Harman looks good value this week. Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me.
Harman  ->  positive

He's a bigger price than Tiger and that doesn't make much sense to me. I really like the Glen Abbey angle in so I've played Jhonattan Vegas and last year's runner-up Charley Hoffman and I was quite surprised to be able to back Harris English at a triple-figure price. His form figures here read 43-73-2-31-14 and he caught the eye last week when a fast finishing 11th.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

Let's ride the hot hand. Wesley Bryan ($7,300): Looking for golfers that can go lights out with the putter, Bryan is near the top of that list. Last year alone he had events where he gained 4 or more strokes putting on the week.
Wesley Bryan  ->  positive

At $10,000 he’s expensive but offers a significant discount on the top players and plenty of upside. MY SLEEPER : Martin Flores ($6,700)  Flores is coming into this event off the back of his best finish on the year in Puerto Rico, where he ended up T10 for the week. What I love about Flores this week is the fact he ranks inside the top-10 on Tour in Greens in Regulation and also seems to be putting the ball well as he was ranked T2 in Birdies Made for the week in Puerto Rico.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

Given his current form and his good showing here in 2014, I thought he was overpriced at 150/1. Anirban Lahiri 150/1 (BetVictor & Boylesports) 0.5pt e/w:  Anirban Lahiri is an exceptional talent and he looks ready to make the next step in his career. Whilst Lahiri has seven professional wins, they have either come on the Asia Tour or events co-sanctioned by both the European and Asian Tour.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

Glen Abbey, home of the Canadian Open for the last three years provides far and away the strongest course correlation. Last year's winner, Jon Rahm, was runner-up in the Canadian Open in 2016, Jhonattan Vegas, who's won the last two editions of the Canadian Open, finished third here on debut in 2011, Farmers winners, Jason Day and Bubba Watson finished one and two in Canada in 2015, and recent Glen Abbey winners, Brandt Snedeker and Tiger Woods are multiple Torrey Pines winners. I recognise that one could argue that Woods, Day, Watson, Snedeker and Rahm are just high quality players that can win anywhere but in addition to those five and Vegas of course, it's also worth highlighting that the 2009 winner of the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey, Nathan Green, who was a huge outsider, also finished runner-up at Torrey Pines in 2006 at a massive price.
Jhonattan Vegas,  ->  positive

In terms of recent play, the guys to target in bogey avoidance are Brian Harman, Justin Thomas, Paul Casey, Chad Campbell, Byeong-Hun An, Chez Reavie, Kyle Reifers, Spencer Levin, Patrick Reed, and Geoff Ogilvy. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Jordan Spieth ($11,400)  Spieth sputtered a bit last week at the U.S. Open but came storming back Sunday with a 69 in difficult conditions. Surprisingly, Spieth’s ball-striking was solid, but it was his trusty putter that let him down at Erin Hills.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here. "There’s something about that special place that really gets me motivated to play the best I can," he told the Augusta Chronicle.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title. With a T4 finish on his most recent start here, as well as some decent finishes under his belt this season, I thought Piller was worth a bet at a big price, in the hope he can find a win the top-level, for the first time.
Piller  ->  positive

He’s clearly the best value amoung the top three players on DK and the stud worth owning to me. Paul Casey ($10,200): I feel like I am beating the drum week after week here with Casey but he really has been excellent over his past few starts. Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings.
Casey  ->  positive

I’ll take you through some viable cash options as we open up the season:  Russell Henley, 7800: Henley hasn’t played here since 2015 and that included a T3 showing, but had been playing well towards the end of last season with a third place finish at the Tour Championship. Henley sits fifth in SG Approach and tenth in DK points in his last eight rounds at Kapalau. Look for Henley to continue to build on last year.
Henley,  ->  positive

That is a recipe that should lead to DFS success this week. Also Consider: Patrick Reed  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Billy Horschel  World Golf Ranking (#72)  Vegas Odds (45/1)  Draftkings ($7,900)    After loading the stats this week and seeing Horschel ranked 6th in SG: OTT + APP and Top 10 in Good Drive %, GIR from 200+, and Par 4 Scoring, I was sure he would be in the mid $8K - $9K range. I was delighted when salaries were released to seem him just under $8K.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Other Options: Matt Kuchar (Cash), Charley Hoffman (GPP)  Mid-Tier Targets:  JB Holmes (DK: $8,500, FD: $8,600)    JB is a much better value on DraftKings, but this a course that should suit him perfectly. Holmes is one of the biggest bombers in golf and has a great short game, as well. He should easily be able to take full advantage of the Par 5s.
Holmes  ->  positive

Going With The Grain  Driving Accuracy  Strokes Gained: Approach  Greens in Regulation  Par 3 Birdie or Better  Jordan Spieth ($12,000) and Matt Kuchar ($9,300) will forever be linked thanks to Sunday of The Open Championship this year. It’s hard to argue against Spieth from a recent form standpoint, with two victories in his last two starts. The course fit might give some people pause with his lack of distance, but a third place finish last year and 10th in 2015 should quell those concerns.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Ryan Palmer, Jimmy Walker, Mark Wilson. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Keegan Bradley, Wesley Bryan, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, James Hahn, Mac Hughes, Jerry Kelly, Kevin Kisner, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Cameron Smith, Robert Streb, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Michael Thompson, Gary Woodland. There's no doubt that players who've played at Kapalua the week before the Sony Open have historically had an advantage.
Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

This is also very much his time of year. Poulter has won eight times from October to December versus just two titles across the preceding three months and while that's in part due to field strength, it's also a reflection of the fact he so often has had more to play for than others as the campaign draws to a close. At 54th in the world rankings that's very much the case once more and Poulter will know that gaining access to next year's majors and World Golf Championships is his best route back into the Ryder Cup side.
Poulter  ->  positive

The Georgia native won earlier in the season and has found some decent form recently too, including a T5 in his last start at the Greenbrier. What is most impressive about Henley’s record this year might be his performance in the years first two majors as he recorded his best ever finish at Augusta with a T11 and was in contention at the U.S. Open until a subpar final round. While he doesn’t have an extensive Open record, Henley has tended to play well on wind-exposed courses before (he has wins in Hawaii and Florida) and did record a top-20 finish at the Open back in 2015 at the Old-Course.
Henley’s  ->  positive

It is tough to see Hughes wining twice in his first full season on Tour but I think he represents good value at 225/1, as he has proved he is suited to these sort of courses already this season. Luke Donald to finish in the top-10 7/1 (BetVictor) 2pts  Donald was 200/1 to win last week at the Genesis Open, so despite his good week I am not that inclined to take him at 70/1 this week. It is important to remember that Donald has not won anywhere since 2013 (Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan) and not won in America since the Transitions Championship (now Valspar Championship) in 2012.
Luke Donald  ->  positive

Back Brendan Steele 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [10.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [5.0]    Next another chance for one of my US Open picks. Steele earned this column a profit at Erin Hills by hitting the lay target when briefly contending during the third round before falling back to 13th. His accurate long game is ideal for championship courses so I expect he may punch above his weight again in majors.
Steele  ->  positive

Granted, the latter was not what he was aiming for at the start of the week but a rain-softened course didn't play into his hands and I expect a pretty dramatic improvement for this ease in grade and more obviously suitable layout. Spieth hasn't hit the heights of 2015 and may never again, but he's still won four times in fewer than 40 events since that season ended, confirming that odds of 10/1 are at worst a good representation of his chances. And unlike McIlroy, whose focus is majors, WGCs and the FedEx Cup, Spieth continues to collect regulation PGA Tour titles.
Spieth  ->  positive

With the wind set to blow this week I am looking to stick with players who are proven in the wind or/and are renowned ‘ball strikers’ and Knox certainly ticks those boxes. Knox’s renowned ball striking strengths had dipped over the 2016/17 period but his 2018 stats show that he is back on track as he currently lies 38th in Driving Accuracy and 6th in GIR. All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.
Russell  ->  positive

Let's ride the hot hand. Wesley Bryan ($7,300): Looking for golfers that can go lights out with the putter, Bryan is near the top of that list. Last year alone he had events where he gained 4 or more strokes putting on the week.
Bryan  ->  positive

What's more, playing team golf certainly seemed to perk him up and it needed to, as he's fallen to 11th on the Presidents Cup points list and while likely to be named as a wildcard anyway, he won't want to leave things to chance. With all that I've said about the absence of real clues here, I would rather chance Reed's proven ability to get the job done over someone like Paul Casey, who is less than half the price but is nowhere near as ruthless. Posted at 1825 BST on 01/05/17.
Reed's  ->  positive

It doesn’t hurt that Rahm recently won the Farmers Insurance Open on a course with Kikuyu grass in the fairways and rough and Poa annua greens like the ones at Chapultepec this week. Sergio Garcia ($8,500): Garcia has been very good at the elevation of Crans-sur Sierre: He won the event in 2005 and has finished third, fourth, and sixth in five starts at that track. Garcia’s 67.8 Recent Adj Rd Score is tied for fourth, his 72.6 percent Recent GIR is 15th, and his 16.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for 11th in this week’s field.
Sergio Garcia  ->  positive

Kisner's obvious advantage here is that he's cracked the top five in the last two years while Harman has yet to manage a top 10 in six visits even if his last three are all top 20s. This venue should suit both men much more than the Plantation Course where Kisner finished in midfield (T17). Kisner, notably, finished top of the Strokes Gained: Putting stats (6.303 over the week) in the Sentry TOC and is a big fan of putting on Bermuda greens so he should again relish this test.
Kisner  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson ($9,900)  Lefty has been in red-hot form the last two weeks, finishing T-5 two weeks ago at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, and then T-2 last week at Pebble Beach. Mickelson has won twice on this course, back-to-back in 2008 and 2009, and also lost in a playoff in 2012. Born in San Diego, look for a pretty large hometown following for Phil this week, a following that has a good chance of seeing their favorite player in contention on Sunday.
Phil  ->  positive

Baddeley ranked fifth for Scrambling on the PGA Tour last year and he finished fourth at the Australian Open last time out and Taylor finished eighth and fourth here, in 2005 and 2006, on his only two previous appearances. Selections:  Fabian Gomez @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [150.0]  Vaughn Taylor @ [220.0]    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Baddeley  ->  positive

Berger is slightly positive in that regard while Kisner shows a slight dip in the wind. I won't miss Perez later in the year, so Pat Perez will be my pick. They didn't pop in the history + baseline method but golfers like Austin Cook, Cameron Smith, and Marc Leishman all pop in the recent form and course fit department.
Perez  ->  positive

However; he is playing some really solid golf lately and starting to figure out his new putting style. If you are into Narrative Street; Bradley just got married recently but I am more convinced that his resurgence is due to his efforts being redoubled and him finally getting the stigma of that major off his back. Keegan is a solid tee to green player with great distance and very accurate, solid irons and approach game make him a viable candidate to show well here at the Waste Management.
Bradley  ->  positive

Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

@ 100/1  There's also been some mileage down the years in picking players who finished nicely at Augusta National without feeling the heat of contention. One who fits the bill here is Si Woo Kim, whose weekend score of five-under was just one more swish than winner Patrick Reed took over the final 36 holes at Augusta National. Kim eventually finished tied 24th.
Kim,  ->  positive

Spieth is currently 20th in Good Drive Percentage and performs well in Par 4 and Par 5 Scoring for the distances that TPC River Highlands features. Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes.
Casey  ->  positive

Putting is clearly of lesser importance here, as the greens are flat and allow even shaky putters to look graceful with the flat stick -- think Hideki Matsuyama, Kevin Stadler, and two-time runner-up Bubba Watson. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12500 – Spieth’s unparalleled putting gets the headlines, but last year he was second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, a major ingredient to success at TPC Scottsdale. Spieth is obviously great at all aspects of the game and can win anywhere, but his combination of smarts and talent should net him his third top-10 finish in as many starts in Scottsdale this week.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot. Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10
Chappell  ->  positive

Thomas can win anywhere and leads the PGA Tour in birdie-or-better percentage. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Marc Leishman, $8500 – A winner at Bay Hill in March, Leishman has put up nothing but solid efforts his last five events, finishing no worse than 34th. He’s also 21st in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green and averages just shy of 4 birdies per round.
Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

J.T. Poston  In a surprisingly deep field, the rookie Poston arrives at TPC Four Seasons at Las Colinas with seven straight made cuts and the 28th-highest Recent Adjusted Round (Adj Rd) Score at 68.9. Over the last year, Poston has exceeded his DraftKings salary expectations with an +11.7 Plus/Minus, averaging 61.6 points per tournament.
Poston  ->  positive

The sensitivity to shotmaking, chipping, putting on Tour‑caliber greens and rough and things that you can’t replicate at your home course is getting sharper because I did play these last two weeks.”  This all makes very good reading as he heads into an event he loves so dearly and I really do believe this is where we could see Mickelson get back to winning ways. Brendan Steele 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Steele has enjoyed a hot start to 2016, and continued that last week with a T20 finish at the Farmers Insurance Open. In six starts this season, Steele has one win and two 6th place finishes.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Outside of Adam Scott (4th in each of the first 3 playoff events), no player has been better on tour. This wouldn’t quite be a Billy Horschel story of coming out of nowhere to win, but Casey would be a surprise winner, and makes for a good 2nd golfer in lineups this week. Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes.
Casey  ->  positive

So far this year there’s been little to recommend the 26-year-old with finishes of T41-MC but he opened the CareerBuilder Challenge with rounds of 67-64 so there are glimmers of form. Danny Lee also has form at TPC Scottsdale, he was leading going into the final round last year but a horrible final 18 holes where his putting fell apart lost him the tournament. I’m sure one of his early season targets is to redeem himself at TPC Scottsdale and he arrives under the radar.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

He owns a runner-up finish at TPC Boston and enjoys putting on bentgrass. Tony Finau ($6,500): Sticking with the theme from above, Finau also loves putting on bentgrass and saves us some salary. Rory McIlroy ($11,100) : He's still one of the best at racking up birdies (and eagles) in bunches when he's on his game.
Finau  ->  positive

Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings. Given the potentially high winds I do think this is a field in which you can potentially fade the top three options and still field a winning gpp roster and Casey might be the man to target if you are going after that strategy. Marc Leishman ($9,300): After a brief hiatus after the Masters to rest a sore back, Leishman looked on point last week at the Byron Nelson with a strong T13 finish, where he ranked second in the field in SG: Tee to Green and third in approaches.
Casey  ->  positive

Take the 16/1. I'll go for the great mates angle again by making Harris English and Hudson Swafford my next picks at 50/1. These two are both Georgia Bulldogs, huge friends off the course (English flew in late to the 2014 Sony Open after attending Swafford's wedding) and even get mistaken for each other due to certain similarities in appearance.
English  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Knox.  ->  positive

“I think my game shapes up well to the challenge as I am fairly precise off the tee, have a good short game and good feel with the putter.”  All ideal credentials for Erin Hills - credentials which are vastly improved from 12 months ago when he finished an excellent T23 and was leading amateur medallist for the week at Oakmont. The odd sign of frustration can still bubble to the surface and this is definitely not the place to lose your rag, but Rahm has a wonderfully affable, laid-back personality and it is not difficult to see him taking that next step up the ladder even though it might be a pretty sizeable one. An 82 at the PLAYERS and a missed cut in The Memorial might not be too much of a setback looking at the bigger picture as he still managed to sandwich a T2 at Colonial in between before turning his attentions to this week.
Rahm  ->  positive

Team #rahmGOAT is back in action this weekend. Adam Scott ($9,800) – Love the way Scott has been playing lately. He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year.
Scott  ->  positive

Dave Tindall previews the first PGA Tour event of the calendar year - the Sentry Tournament of Champions at Kapalua Resort in Hawaii...  "Two years ago Fowler fired 69-67-69-67 for a top five. It means he's 26-under for his last five rounds at Kapalua." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 5 places  Main Bet: Back Rickie Fowler e.w.
Fowler  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7400): The third golfer this week is also a mid-priced option, which leaves lots of wiggle room to squeeze in an elite golfer without blowing over the salary cap; the 29-year old Stanley has had his coming-out party this year, sitting 38th in FedEx Cup points and three top-10s including a T4 at the PLAYERS. Going back to the fall swing season, Stanley has only missed two cuts (Honda and OHL Classic), and has been one of the best on Tour in terms of tee-to-green (5th) and Bogey Avoidance (12th). Where Stanley has struggled immensely is with the flatstick in hand, ranking 165th in SG: Putting, but he’s elite in almost every other factor on the way to the green.
Stanley  ->  positive

Jon Rahm  ->  positive

At a venue where you're meant to have five or six tries before fathoming things out, Spieth has Masters form of 2-1-2-11. After a rather mixed season so far, Spieth went into the Houston Open trying to give himself the perfect springboard for another Green Jacket assault. He did just that with rounds of 68-67-71-66 to finish third.
Spieth  ->  positive

He hit the front during the opening round at the WGC-Mexico Championship last time out, when he raced to seven-under-par through 11 holes, before a bizarre finish saw him sit tied for 13th after 18 and in his previous three starts he finished the first day within three of the lead so he's been starting fast of late. Paul Krishnamurty says: Back Francesco Molinari @ 50/1  On the European Tour, especially in events where he already boasted a good record, Francesco Molinari has often started brilliantly to claim the first round lead - he also led at last year's Wells Fargo. Having finished no worse than 17th in the last four Bay Hill renewals, three of which yielded top-nines, there's every reason to believe he can do so again.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

I felt it was important to play rather than week on, week off, and just kind of get some momentum going." He certainly has that momentum now after his top five and Rose's past experiences at Bay Hill suggest another bold bid. This is a venue where past course form seems to count for more than average and Rose has a second in 2013, a third in 2011, an eighth in 2006 and, most recently, T13 (2017) and T9 (2016) the last two years.
Rose's  ->  positive

He looks like a player that could really suit this course and has to be respected here. Patrick Reed 33/1  Despite starting the season poorly, Reed has been showing some good signs over the last few weeks with some solid performances. He finished solo 10th at the Hero World Challenge and followed that with a T6 at the SBS Tournament of Champions, which included a second round 65.
Reed  ->  positive

Although has not necessarily excelled this year a T25 finish at the WGC – Mexico Championship was a step in the right direction for Molinari. Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced.
Molinari.  ->  positive

Leishman is playing well and was seventh last week. Tony Finau ($11,000 | 33) - Finau didn't play last week at Kapalua but does have strong recent form, reeling off six straight top-26 finishes. He grades out 6th in tee-to-green play over the past 12 events, as well as 7th in par 5 scoring, 10th in birdie or better rate, and 2nd in driving distance.
Finau  ->  positive

Ranks third in total driving, second in greens hit, third in proximity to the hole, fifth in strokes gained: tee-to-green and 11th in adjusted scoring. Harris English ... The career arc is a funny thing regardless of pedigree.
Harris English  ->  positive

Keep your eye on him for “weekend golf” at DraftKings, where bogeys are much less disastrous. Even with his Recent Bogey Score, Cauley is a top-five golfer in the CSURAM88 Player Model. Patrick Reed  Reed has missed the cut in three of his last five tournaments and in his only two appearances at The Byron Nelson, so he’s probably terrifying for people who focus on recent form and course history.
Cauley  ->  positive

he ranks #1 on my model because of the elite form and ranks behind only DJ in my stats model. Looking at the salary gap on DraftKings between the two, I will take the discount with Rahm as new courses have not even come close to stopping this kids momentum early in his career. Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#34)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,300)    Believe it or not, Molinari actually comes in a tick higher than DJ in the form ranks this week.
Rahm  ->  positive

Over five starts at Hilton Head since 2011, he has three top-10s, including a T4 from 2016. DFS STRATEGY  Cash Games — Of the top-four golfers this week, the one who seems best suited for this format is Matt Kuchar ($10,800). It was mentioned above, but Kuchar has not missed a cut at Hilton Head since before 2004.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

One of those missed cuts came in the season-opener, the Safeway Open in October and the other at the RSM Classic in November. It is really since the turn of the new year that Harman has looked in great shape. In 2017, Harman has two top-24 finishes, taking his top-25 tally to three for the season (finished T15 at the Shriners in Vegas).
Harman  ->  positive

RESULT: T17  Hideki Matsuyama 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (5 places EW, 1/4 odds):  It's been a fascinating spell at the top of world golf in recent times with the elite players each seemingly taking it in turns to show what they can do before handing the baton to one of their peers. As the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy have all reached the world number 1 spot before hitting the buffers over the past few years, Hideki Matsuyama has been steadily creeping up on them all with some scintillating golf at times. Having hit a career-high of 2nd in the OWGR after finishing runner-up to Koepka at the US Open, the 25 year-old is going to need to win a Major or two if he's going to find his way to the very top of the pile in this current climate, however that's certainly not out of the realms of possibility.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

As well, there are lots of boom/bust players at Sawgrass: Rickie Fowler has a win and a 2nd to his name, with multiple missed cuts, Kevin Na has three top-10s but three missed cuts, and the list goes on. The Golfers  The Core  Justin Thomas ($8900): Although he’s only played the track twice, JT calls the PLAYERS his favorite event on Tour (non-major), and has the short course history to show for it with a top-25 his first time out followed by a T3 last year. On courses where he doesn’t have the opportunity to spray his driver all over the course (54.68% Driving Accuracy), Thomas is always an immediate consideration given how strong the rest of his game plays.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Last year’s winner Dustin Johnson led the year long stats in that range in 2016 and 2015 runner-up Bubba Watson was also very strong in that area when he won. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($10,600): Fowler has played remarkably well ever since February and is probably a tad unlucky he only has one win to his credit thus far. That could easily change at Firestone however, a course where Rickie has finished inside the top ten on four out of seven visits.
Fowler  ->  positive

I will be using Dufner in both cash and gpp formats at this price point. Adam Hadwin ($8,400) – Another mid-range player you can use to pay up for other golfers, Hadwin also comes in with great form and solid course history. Hadwin is 2/2 at Dean and Deluca Invitational with a 22nd and 5th.
Hadwin  ->  positive

The credentials are strong but I think the 20/1 presumes Cauley will flourish again and I'm not so sure he can. Instead, I'll head back to the 50/1 shots and take Russell Henley and Blayne Barber. Looking back, these two were teammates on the 2011 US Palmer Cup squad.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Bozzelli made the cut at the Sony Open last week, shooting three rounds of 68 or better and he finished fifth at this event last year. Dominic Bozzelli ($6,800): The 216 golfers who have played this tournament with a DraftKings salary of $6,900 or less have averaged 63.19 PPT with a +15.64 Plus/Minus and 73.1 percent Consistency. Despite his recent course history and affordable salary, Hadwin appears to be flying under the radar this week.
Dominic Bozzelli  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

But his price has been cut and I don’t think I can back him at just 12/1 on a course that he hasn’t seen before. Instead I will include him in a small each way double with Francesco Molinari. Summary of Bets  Shriners Open  Francesco Molinari – 1pt ew @ 30/1  John Huh – 0.5pt ew @ 150/1  Colt Knost – 0.25pt ew @ 300/1  Turkish Open  Matthew Southgate – 0.5pt ew @ 66/1  Benjamin Hebert – 0.5pt ew @ 100/1  Fabrizio Zanotti – 0.5pt ew @ 66/1  0.25 ew double @ 402/1 – Molinari + Sullivan  Weekly points advised – 7pts  Total pts advised – 840pts  @theGreek82  Advertisements

I care more about winning now and less about just making cuts or trying to establish myself. I feel like I've been out here long enough to show that I'm a decent player, Saunders told golf.com. Since shooting a 59 at October's Web.com Championship (in Florida) and securing his PGA Tour card, the 30-year-old has started 2018 with a top 25 at the Sony Open and T8 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Saunders  ->  positive

A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
Noren  ->  negative

Horschel was fourth there in the spring and eighth, alongside McGirt, in 2016. Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here. While Horschel closed with a bogey at Colonial, Emiliano Grillo finished birdie-birdie for 24th and some momentum ahead of his return to this event.
Horschel  ->  positive

Wagner makes for a strong cash play with GPP upside this week as he has made four of five cuts, including a win in 2011. Jeff Bergerson -- Ryan Blaum ($6,900)  One of the quieter rookies so far on the Tour, Blaum has nevertheless established himself as a player to be on the lookout for during the rest of the season. Blaum has made the cut in all three events this season and finished no lower than 31st.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

Harbour Town should set up quite nicely for his particular skill set, and the price is pretty reasonable for all formats. Luke Donald ($7,800) – Donald’s certainly not a guy we rely on week to week, but at certain spots, he’s just ridiculous – this one of them. Since 2009, Donald has carded four (4) runner-up finishes along with two third-place finishes.
Luke Donald  ->  positive

He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter. Bryan tied for 47th in proximity last year and was 45th in strokes gained putting, with both positions improving as the season went on. With many short par-4s, wedge play will take on added importance this week.
Bryan  ->  positive

If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
Justin Thomas.  ->  negative

You only need to look at another of the players in our team this week, Billy Horschel, for evidence of this. Horschel of course memorably chunked a ball in to the water when he had the Deutsche Bank Championship in his hands in 2014 only to come back out and win the BMW Championship the following week. Another memorable example was Kyle Stanley who gifted away the Farmers Insurance event at Torrey Pines on the 72nd hole only to win the following week at the Phoenix Open.
Billy Horschel,  ->  positive

Patton Kizzire, who won the aforementioned OHL Classic nicely in November missed the cut on debut 12 months ago and he didn't put brilliantly last week when finishing 15th but I thought [85.0] was juicy enough for him. And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average.
Chris Stroud,  ->  positive

At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago). Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

My one major concern is that he has never won a PGA Tour event (excluding Open Championship) but he has contended at the Masters,in WGC’s and here, so he is clearly capable of doing so. Sean O’Hair 110/1 (Bet365)  Last week Sean O’Hair finished 2nd at The Barclays, which was only his second top-10 of the season. This doesn’t tell the whole story though and 2016 has been another decent chapter in a fight back in his career.
Sean  ->  positive

Vegas Odds  Since 2014, Spieth has played in about as many tournaments with odds to win of at least 10 percent as he has with odds of less than 10 percent. Unsurprisingly, he has excelled as a double-digit Vegas favorite:  Conversely, Spieth has exceeded his salary-based expectations in just 20 of 39 tournaments when playing with odds to win of less than 10 percent. His PPT drops to 74.92 — nearly 10 points below his average as a favorite — and his Plus/Minus dips by -0.64 points.
Spieth  ->  positive

Casey is only 20/1 this week, but this is a reduced field and he clearly has an affinity with the course, so all in all the price doesn’t look as quite as bad as it may first appear. Justin Rose 20/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Rose has not played since the FedEx Cup play-offs so comes into this week fresh from a run of form that saw him finish inside the top-10 in each of the four FedEx Cup play-off events with a 2nd and three 10th place finishes. There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off.
Rose  ->  positive

He started 2017 with a T17 at the SBS Tournament of Champions in Kapalua and followed that with a T11 at The Sony where he opened with an impressive 64 in round one. Knox has only played here once before which was back in 2015 finishing a respectable T15 on nine under for the tournament. The Scot ranks 37th in SGP, 12th in driving accuracy, 11th in GIR, fourth in par 3 scoring and eighth in par 5 scoring.
Knox  ->  positive

PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.

Away from the obvious favourite the same faces show up time and again and it was a matter of prices that appeal. We were on Harris English last week and he was our best finisher of the week in 8th. That continues his revival after a torrid 2017 when slipping from top-80 in the OWGR to outside the top-250 and after a closing 11th at the CareerBuilder he may well continue some impressive event form.
Harris English  ->  positive

On the European side, Stenson’s played three times and picked up two top-10s (T6 in Dubai, 8th in Abu Dhabi), so his form is fine as he heads into the week looking to gear up for the first major. Other golfers to consider: Russell Henley ($9200) – immaculate course history even if the YTD stats don’t appeal, Charles Howell III ($8900)  Value Golfers (below $8000)  J.B. Holmes ($7300): Another golfer that missed the cut here last year but has strong course history beyond that (prior to 2017 his last MC here was in 2007), Holmes is another longer hitter that can dial it back off the tee to put himself in great spots for second shots. Holmes proved that in his win in 2015, which is the highlight of his history here that also includes a runner-up, T8, T12, and T42.
Holmes  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs. The defending FedEx Cup Champ, Spieth finished 2nd here as well back in 2013, with a disappointing 27th in 2014 in between. Spieth needs a win and some help to win the FedEx Cup, and while he may have had a “disappointing” season by his standards, it wouldn’t surprise me to see him repeat come Sunday night.
Spieth  ->  positive

This week, several golfers with great LT Adj Rd Scores and low salaries are available: Stewart Cink (who looks like the value chalk play this week), Chad Campbell, and Luke List. Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips.
List.  ->  positive

Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  negative

That is solid playing for close to min price on DraftKings. Ryan Blaum ($6,300) is another player with great value this week. He placed 35th in the 2015 ULC and then placed 10th in the 2016 ULC.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

He's been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta. Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn't exactly fit the "bomber" prototype that tends to succeed here, but he didn't play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition's averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance with his driver -- he sits near the top in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes.
Moore  ->  positive

If that remains the case this week, he looks a good price to continue his current form in the event. Lowry has struggled to keep bogeys off his card this season, something he will have to improve on this week, however he tends to bounce back from a bad hole fairly often. He currently ranks 11th in the Bounce Back category on the PGA Tour, so he is following up bogeys with birdies or better on a regular basis.
Lowry  ->  positive

DeChambeau finished 14th at the Mayakoba earlier this season, a bonus bit of optimism this week and if he can build on his performances in Phoenix (5th) and Bay Hill which have both come on his last six starts, he can certainly feature here, in a field where a lot of the top players are absent. Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee.
Cook  ->  positive

Michael Bamberger, senior writer, Sports Illustrated: It’s neat how, at almost every Open venue, the course is the story going in and the players upon it is the story going out. This course is particularly interesting and Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, etc., are compelling players. John Wood, caddie for Matt Kuchar (@Johnwould): I'm anxious to see if different types of golfers can compete on this track.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot. Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10
Chappell  ->  positive

Henley may have only won one match in his group last week at the Match Play, but he proved difficult to beat, losing his matches to Kyle Stanley and Paul Casey by just one hole, whilst taking care of Matthew Fitzpatrick with a 3&2 victory. In four starts at Augusta, Henley has finished MC-31-21-11 so not only does he like this course, he’s also trending in the right direction at the course it warms you up for, so it’s clear he likes the way they both setup. If adverse weather conditions do hit this event this week, that won’t bother Henley one bit, given his exponents in windy conditions (wins in Hawaii and PGA National), so there really doesn’t appear to be many downsides about his chances this week.
Henley  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson 28/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson has not won since the 2013 Open Championship and that is an obvious concern, but where better to get back on track than TPC Scottsdale. Mickelson is a three-time winner here and has shot the course record (60) twice, so it is clear he loves the place. Unlike Torrey Pines (where he had struggled in recent years), Mickelson has still kept up his form here.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Prior to the Genesis Open, he'd made six straight cuts on Tour with three top-10 finishes. PGA National has similar attributes (windy, narrow, lots of water hazards, and bermuda greens) to Mayakoba, TPC Southwind, and Harbour Town, all of which are venues where Gay has won. And for those of you who are stat geeks, Gay ranks 18th in total strokes gained against the field over the past 10 weeks.

Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes. His play so far this year is good enough to land him within the top-60 in every major statistical category.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Marc Leishman was giving both Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth all they could handle at TPC Boston last Monday, but ultimately - with a 2-shot lead on the 10th tee - the pressure got to him. However from adversity we've seen players blossom and Leishman, who sits 7th in the FedEx Cup standings, has the kind of result CV that links beautifully to previous winners here Zach Johnson and Jason Day. 5th at Waialae in 2014 (Johnson was winner there in 2009), 2nd at Torrey Pines in both 2010 and 2014 (Day was a winner there in 2015), 1st at Bay Hill this year (Day won there in 2016), 4th at Augusta in 2013 (Johnson won there in 2007, Day 2nd in 2011), 3rd at TPC Four Seasons in both 2012 and 2014 (Day won there in 2010), 2nd at St Andrews in 2015 (Johnson won the title, with Day 4th a single shot out of the Playoff), plus 3rd at Firestone in 2014 (Johnson was 2nd there this year), highlight that Leishman can circulate in very high echelons when he plays his very best golf.
Leishman  ->  positive

Don’t be shy with him this week. UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($10,600) – The tougher the track, the more I love Rickie. He’s been a force on tour this year at the toughest of venues, and I would call him one of the better values in the field for his price even if it is a bit steep.
Rickie  ->  positive

In terms of shooting low scores, 3 of Brandt's wins have come with resort scoring totals of -22/266, -19/267 and -22/265. With his play into late December combined with his result CV, Snedeker is undoubtedly the sort of player who wins this season opener. RESULT: T14  Justin Thomas 2pts EW 22/1 with NEW OFFER!
Snedeker  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  MY PICK : Martin Kaymer ($9,500)  Martin Kaymer hasn’t won since his victory at the U.S. Open in 2014, but he does have a great streak of 28 starts without a missed cut going and should generally be considered the class of a fairly weak field this week. While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence.
Kaymer  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

He tied for fourth in this tournament two years ago. Jonathan Coachman: Jordan Spieth ($12,600)  I normally hate to pick back-to-back winners, but what I've seen in Spieth is very Tiger-esque. By turning down guaranteed money overseas, he is telling the world that he's serious about being dominant like he was in 2015.
Spieth  ->  positive

Danny Lee  3. Jonas Blixt  MY PICK : Paul Casey ($8,800)  Casey, remarkably, has only one win on US soil thus far in what has otherwise been a very impressive career. While he’s let some opportunities slide by recently, his game is still in top form.
Casey  ->  positive

Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week.
Rodgers  ->  positive

He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
Kuchar,  ->  negative

Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view. RESULT: T9  Tony Finau 1pt EW 45/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Matthew Fitzpatrick 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £30 welcome offer for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  Based on his 6th at Torrey Pines and runner-up finish behind Bubba Watson at Riviera, Tony Finau is another player who can clearly play the Kikuyu/Poa Annua combination effectively and whilst he's playing as well as he is, he's got a live chance here. Length may be the Utah bomber's main asset, however when he's playing well he can regularly find greens in their requisite number - for the past 6 months or so that's been a feature of his play that's seen him produce 5 top-7 finishes in 10 starts overall.
Watson's  ->  positive

Harris English put in a strange performance last week, playing brilliantly one day and awful the next but nobody bettered his six-under-par 65 on Sunday so I thought I'd chance him at a triple-figure price, given he's a former OHL Classic winner, and I've also thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned Aussie, Aaron Baddeley, at a huge price. Selections:  Billy Horschel @ [40.0]  Harris English @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [180.0]  I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Aaron Baddeley,  ->  positive

Given the combination of course form, recent form and statistical positives, he’s entitled to go very well this week. My next best is Brian Harman who himself notched a second career PGA Tour win at the Wells Fargo Championship back in May, having recorded his maiden victory at this very tournament back in 2014. He followed that Wells Fargo triumph with a career best major performance at the US Open in June, holding the 54 hole lead before ultimately finishing runner up to an inspired Brooks Koepka.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Spieth was Top 10 in virtually every major statistic last season including strokes gained: tee-to-green, strokes gained: approach, and birdie or better %. Overall, Spieth has been as dominant at this course as any other in his career. Dustin Johnson ($10,300) – It was a very hard to choose between the long hitter in Dustin Johnson who can just overpower this course, or Jordan Spieth who always plays well here.
Spieth  ->  positive

The good news is that these types of disasters will probably continue to make him an affordable option in stronger fields, so he’ll need to stay in the consideration set even with these Sunday struggles. Brandt Snedeker: Well, I refused to pay the $10K for him because outside of two wins at Pebble, his average finish was legit T50. Brandt continues to punish me for failing to believe that he loves California, putting up a solid 4th place finish.
Brandt  ->  positive

Going to be significantly overweight the field on Casey. Rickie Fowler ($10,500) – The MC at the Fedex St. Jude have you scared away? Fowler is an excellent play in tournaments for that very reason.
Fowler  ->  positive

Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
Kirk  ->  negative

He is a GPP only play on FanDuel over $10K but in the mid $7K range on DraftKings, I will have exposure in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Ollie Schniederjans  World Golf Ranking (#84)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FanDuel ($9,400)    I ran two models this week(current stats from FNGC & my own long-term stats from sheet) and Ollie ranked Top 15 in both. On my sheet, he ranks Top 20 in Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Around the Green, Par 4 Scoring, and Birdie or Better % and over the last 24 rounds when looking at current stats form, he ranks Top 30 in each category as well(see below).
Ollie  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play. The Texan is a great pick for any of the major championships.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience. He has had significant success at British Opens in the past, and I believe his superb T2G game and should put him squarely in the conversation to ship this event, particularly if the conditions get nasty.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th). Finau also ranks 21st in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green and whilst he has seemingly struggled on the 450-500 yard Par 4’s (78th), I am confident he can post another strong finish around this track. At 50/1 you are getting a player in good form, with quality course form to boot.
Finau  ->  positive

Selections  Unless I get a fabulous angle in, I always take it steady at a new venue and so stakes are small this week but I couldn't resist a wager on DJ, who isn't that much shorter to win here than he was to win the US Masters, and I've had a couple of tiny bets on the two Eagle Point members - Simpson and Pettersson. The latter named is a really speculative punt but I quite like Simpson. Like DJ, his record on Bentgrass greens is very good and he arrives at Eagle Point in fair form given he was beaten in a playoff in Phoenix in February and that he was tied 11th at the Heritage last time out.
Simpson  ->  positive

Let’s see what we came up with:  If you have any questions – don’t hesitate to hit me up on Twitter at @AssemblyNeil. Luxury Items  Jordan Spieth ($11,400 DraftKings/$10,100 FanDuel) – After firing an encouraging 68 in the final round of the US Open, I have a feeling that many people will be on Spieth this week, but I can’t find any reason not to play him. Spieth leads the field in strokes gained approach, is 2nd in greens in regulation, 2nd in proximity and 4th in par 4 birdie percentage.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Motivation-wise he sits 51st in the FEC standings so needs to move quickly to guarantee his Tour Championship spot and, more interestingly, his recent record at TPC Boston is not the best and he was only 16th at Crooked Stick in 2012, although he was defending the title so that needs to be taken into account. But all of this is superseded by the fact that when Rose is at the top of his game he strings excellent results together. I think back to 2010 when after winning his first PGA Tour title at The Memorial, in his next outing he led by 3 shots going into Sunday at the Travelers Championship, eventually capitulating Sunday and finishing 9th - Justin Rose in 2016 would not do that.
Rose  ->  positive

The three I like best are former winner Aaron Baddeley, who caught the eye at the Shell Houston Open a fortnight ago when he finished 15th, ranking second for Scrambling, Blayne Barber, who was beaten in a playoff at the RSM Classic last year, and Zac Blair, who I thought was a fair price at [250.0] given he currently ranks second for Scrambling and that he finished eighth at the Shell. Selections:  Aaron Baddeley @ [160.0]  Zac Blair @ [250.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [400.0]  Blayne Barber @ [500.0]  Ben Crane @ [600.0]  Davis Love III @ [600.0]    I'll be back later with my Trophée Hassan II preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Zac Blair,  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Justin Rose – $11,400  If I am picking between any of the guys at the top, Justin Rose is the first guy on the list. Rose has back-to-back top five finishes and has come inside the top 10 an incredible 11 of his last 13 tournaments.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Back nearer the front of the betting, Paul Casey is certainly an each-way shout at 22s and perhaps more than that after finally getting his first win on American soil since 2009 when landing the Valspar Championship. Rickie Fowler and Marc Leishman fit best on the 10-year-trends and are worthy of inspection while who knows what Ian Poulter (three top 10s at Augusta) is capable of after booking his place with a win in Houston last week. But you can't back them all and I'm happy to let Spieth and Mickelson lead the charge with Aphibarnrat playing the role of surprise contender.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

I've also thrown a few pennies at another of last year's selections - the 2010 Farmers winner, Ben Crane. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [8.4]  J.B Holmes @ [55.0]  Scott Stallings @ [75.0]  Harris English @ [85.0]  C.T Pan @ [180.0]  Ben Crane @ [230.0]  K.J Choi @ [330.0]      I'll be back with the In-Play Blog on Thursday or Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Ben Crane.  ->  positive

He could threaten a place putting badly and it's in the hope that a few weeks off have helped him find something that the Kentucky native gets the vote. Of the many tempting options at three-figure prices, it's Andrew Landry who stands out. Born in Texas, Landry won a couple of minor tour events in his home state before turning professional and hinting that difficult conditions may bring out his best when scoring a five-shot victory in 11-under-par on the Web.com Tour.
Andrew Landry  ->  positive

Danny Lee ($10,200) has a great blend of recent form and course history. Lee has made seven straight cuts this year. When Lee last played this event in 2015, he finished in third place.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
Reed  ->  negative

He putted well last week when finishing tied for 23rd and I thought he was worth another chance at a huge price. Selections:  Jon Rahm @ [29.0]  Jimmy Walker @ [50.0]  Ryan Blaum @ [160.0]  Ben Crane @ [200.0]    I'll be back with the In-Play Blog on Thursday or Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR. It was therefore with some amusement that those of us on this side of the pond watched the US lead coverage from Torrey Pines 3 weeks ago, during which we were treated to interviews and commentary that portrayed Alex as a complete rookie, who would potentially react like a rabbit in the headlights when faced with the possibility of winning on US soil!
NOREN  ->  positive

Johnson was unlucky not to win the PGA Championship back in 2010, receiving a two-stroke penalty in the final-round, which cost him a place in the play-off with Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer. Six years on, Johnson finally got his first major win at the U.S. Open and he only looked forward from there. Following that win at the U.S. Open last June he has won five times, including three WGC’s.
Johnson  ->  positive

Holmes won’t be highlighted in many places this week as this is more of a course fit play than a stats-based play, so he should come in at low-ownership. Chris Kirk ($7500): Entering the week after a 13th-place finish at Bay Hill, Kirk is very underpriced for this tournament considering his excellent form this year: three finishes of 13th or better, three finishes between T33 and T49, and his two missed cuts both came at 54-hole cut events. Kirk is underpriced thanks to not having played this tournament since 2014 (T65), but he’s yet to miss a cut in three shots at it, and also has a T22 and a runner-up finish(!)
Kirk  ->  positive

That explains why he didn't tee it up in March and it was encouraging to see him sit 12th through 54 holes last week on his first start since becoming a father, before a difficult back-nine on Sunday undid much of the good work. We often talk about Keith Elliott's nappy factor as a potential trigger for improved play and while it's far from an exact science, given Landry's local ties, preference for a tough course, brace of top-five finishes this season and sneakily-good effort at Harbour Town last week, I'm more than willing to chance him at the odds. Local ties have been important here in the past with the likes of Bowditch and Jimmy Walker taking the title, and they point towards Tom Hoge perhaps going better than many expect.
Landry's  ->  positive

The PGA picks are back! Sony Open: Winner: Spieth Top 10: Howell, Woodland, Dufner DK Sleepers: Knox, Kirk OAD: Chucky Three-Stix
Spieth  ->  positive

All the stars aligned for Holmes, as they had done for Jones 12 months earlier and in the fullness of time, these two results could well be viewed upon as freakish. Prior to 2014, Adam Scott in 2007, who benefited from a late Stuart Appleby collapse, had been the only winner not to be within two of the lead with a round to go and every winner bar Holmes has been inside the top-four places after 54 holes. The short par four 12th is easy enough and the par five 13th ranked the second easiest on the course last year but after that the finish is tough enough with the par five 15th the only easy hole coming in.
Holmes,  ->  positive

And at a similar price, Louis Oosthuizen and Francesco Molinari have not a single victory on American soil between them. As for the stats this season, Haas is 13th in Greens In Regulation, 15th in Scoring Average, 25th in Sand Saves and 5th in Scrambling. He also appears on Future of Fantasy's top 25 performers on Bentgrass greens (since 2013-14) and those are the surfaces in play this week.
Haas  ->  positive

His best finish in this event came in 2014 when he finished fourth. Spieth's stats line up well for the three courses this week. He ranked fourth in BoB% and Par 5 scoring last season, and this year ranks second in both.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Five Under Five  Mr. Miyagi  As discussed in this week’s Course Breakdown, Ben Crane has had success at some similar TPC courses. In five events at TPC Southwind and The Old White TPC since 2014, Crane has exceeded his salary-based expectations four times (80.0 percent), averaging a strong +16.20 Plus/Minus on DraftKings:  Moreover, Crane dropped 74.50 DraftKings points at TPC Southwind earlier this month, good for a whopping +25.73 Plus/Minus. Additionally, it’s likely that Crane will keep his tee shots out of trouble this week: Crane is tied for 12th in the field with his 65.6 Driving Accuracy (DA) percentage.
Crane  ->  positive

Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Putting 10'-15', BoB% (Birdie or Better), Bogey Avoidance, Scrambling, Rough Proximity. Top-Tier Plays  Dustin Johnson ($11,100)  Dustin Johnson is "Taylor Made" for this course. He ranked sixth or better in three of our key stats from 2016 (1stt in BoB%, 4th in Par 5 Scoring, and 6th in Rough Proximity).
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Look for List to stay hot at Bay Hill this week, where he placed T17 during his API debut in 2017. Kiradech Aphibarnrat - $14,100    Aphibarnrat traveled to the tiny nation of Brunei this past week for the Richard Mille Brunei Championships of the Asian Development Tour, where he was not only the featured entrant, but eventual champion by a whole six strokes at 23-under-par. He’s now up to a pair of wins in his last four starts, having won the ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth last month as well.
Kiradech Aphibarnrat  ->  positive

Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago. Campbell has made seven of his last eight cuts with no finish worse than 34th. The field has caught on as Campbell has regularly been on of the highest owned options in cash his last 2 events.
Campbell  ->  positive

The runner-up at last year’s US Open has clearly given him new belief and whilst he has another hard to win with, a top placing is certainly on the cards. Daniel Berger has a similar profile to Harman but the same can be said of Kisner and Dufner – so many ball-strikers that come to the fore when bombing is taking out of the equation. However, the final vote goes to Tom Hoge.
Harman  ->  positive

Jason Dufner - Jason Dufner has three straight top-25 finishes and enters this week ranked 14th in driving accuracy percentage and sand save percentage. Dufner is hitting a good ball right now and enters an event where he’s finished top-30 in each of his last eight appearances. There’s no reason not to like Dufner this week, especially when he’s getting odds of +4000 to win.
Dufner  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?

Throw in his wildness off the tee -- a shortcoming that's severely penalized at the Greenbrier -- and I'm staying away. Expert Picks  Kevin Kisner  Danny Lee  Keegan Bradley  Bill Haas  Patrick Reed  Sung Kang  Gary Woodland  Xander Schauffele  Webb Simpson  Russell Henley  Pinterest Icon Sportswire  Expert Explanation : Does Kisner even need rationale? Kisner has six top-10 finishes on the season, and was a runner-up the last time this event was played.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

But you can't back them all and I'm happy to let Spieth and Mickelson lead the charge with Aphibarnrat playing the role of surprise contender. Rickie Fowler and Marc Leishman fit best on the 10-year-trends and are worthy of inspection while who knows what Ian Poulter (three top 10s at Augusta) is capable of after booking his place with a win in Houston last week. Back nearer the front of the betting, Paul Casey is certainly an each-way shout at 22s and perhaps more than that after finally getting his first win on American soil since 2009 when landing the Valspar Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

22 East Asia appearances have generated 8th at the 2013 BMW Masters, 8th at the 2014 Volvo China Open and 2nd last time Rafael visited the area at last year's Hong Kong Open at Fanling. RESULT: T11  Cameron Smith 1pt EW 45/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Young Aussie sensation Cameron Smith has to be a danger this week. Equally adept at grinding or reeling off par-breakers, the 24 year-old from the Gold Coast must be full of confidence after his second top-5 finish at TPC Kuala Lumpur last week and at a course in South Korea that nobody has competitive knowledge of, his experience on the Asian Tour puts him in good stead.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Prior to missing the cut at Harbour Town, he'd extended his flawless Augusta record with an eighth cut made from eight starts there, having previously reached the semi-finals of the WGC-Match Play in Texas. He's also won at places like Riviera and Congressional which may also tie in quite nicely with Eagle Point, he putts well on bentgrass greens and has twice won after a missed cut before, so Haas looks the most attractive each-way bet towards the top of the market. Lucas Glover is another with local ties via Clemson, he's won this event before and his long-game remains as sharp as ever, but the greens here at Eagle Point look as pure as they come and he might just find himself giving up too much ground on them.
Haas  ->  positive

Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. (2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III.
Murray  ->  positive

– –  These are my two early picks and whilst I may add one or two in the next couple of days, I really like the chances of both Rose and Haas this week. Haas has also now posted top-10’s at both the Open Championship and U.S. Open, something he hadn’t done in major championships until last season, adding to his big event pedigree. Considering he already has six wins and would be nearer 10, if other play-offs went his way, the 35-year old is clearly more than capable of winning at the top level.
Rose  ->  positive

The major concern from the Texas native is his poor course history here, missing the cut three times since the course converted from Bentgrass greens, but he’s talented enough in other areas to ignore that, on top of the fact that Gay has had an excellent season with three top–10s and is coming into the week off of a T42 at the Barracuda. One of the main things that has held Gay back throughout his career is his lack of distance, which won’t be an issue, but he’s above average (34th) in driving accuracy and is absolutely deadly with a wedge. He’ll struggle on the longer par-4s, but expect him to find lots of fairways and score on the shorter holes.
Gay  ->  positive

Finally, all be it a slightly different type of ‘ comeback from disappointment’, came as recently as three weeks ago when Ian Poulter overcame the huge upset of having a Masters appearance basically handed to him then taken away only to deliver the necessary win the following week in Houston. So, the evidence is there that with the right mentality a player can come back out the next week and overcome a huge disappointment from the previous, and there is no doubt Si Woo Kim is a special talent who has the ability to do so, but can he do it on this course? Well, as I’ve mentioned already I believe Si Woo’s long game attributes for the course aren’t in doubt and he played solidly here last year to finish 22nd.
Si Woo Kim  ->  positive

Play him with absolute confidence. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Kyle Stanley ($6700) : Stanley finally picked up his first win in years at the Quicken Loans National, and he managed to pull it off while losing strokes to the field with his putter. That speaks to just how talented a golfer he is getting from tee to green, and at an incredible value of only $6700, Stanley is almost a must-play.
Stanley  ->  positive

Kuchar will have gained a lot mentally for going head-to-head with Spieth at Royal Birkdale and at a tournament where the true elite often have a week off, I think Kuchar has a big chance to gain his first win since 2014. RESULT: T10  Charley Hoffman 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Charley Hoffman sits at 11th in the FedEx Cup standings and similar to 2016 Barclays champion Patrick Reed, who resided in the final Ryder Cup qualification spot this time last year prior to winning, he also finds himself in the last automatic qualification spot for the Presidents Cup right now. He also shares another compelling fact with Reed from last year: with 7 top-10s in 2017, Charley is the highest player in the FEC not to have won this season.
Charley  ->  positive

Back in November, he was runner-up at the RSM Classic while the Florida man has some good Web.com form in Louisiana (T11 and T6). He's a good putter (24th in Strokes Gained: Putting) while the pair are 18th (Henley) and 56th respectively in the Birdie Average stats. There's only one round of evidence of them playing together as pros but at least it's positive.
(Henley)  ->  positive

Poulter has won eight times from October to December versus just two titles across the preceding three months and while that's in part due to field strength, it's also a reflection of the fact he so often has had more to play for than others as the campaign draws to a close. At 54th in the world rankings that's very much the case once more and Poulter will know that gaining access to next year's majors and World Golf Championships is his best route back into the Ryder Cup side. Today was the sweatiest I've ever been on a golf course... battled back after a poor start.. 5 under on my back 9.
Poulter  ->  positive

He is no stranger to windy seaside courses winning at venues such as St Andrews in 2015, Hyundai TOC in Kapalua in 2014 and the RBC Heritage in Harbour Town in 2012. Top 20 double – Charles Howell (Sony)/Jason Scrivener (SA Open) @10/1  Charles Howell has a ridiculously good record here in Waialae with eight top 20’s (including seven top 10’s) in his last 12 appearances here. He has three top 20’s in his last four starts so far this season and looks to be in decent form and well worth backing.
Charles  ->  positive

To counter-act his Scrambling issues, there’s a good chance he won’t have to rely on his wedge game much, as he ranks 9th in approaches from 150-175 and 23rd from 175-200, which is fantastic given how important these ranges are this week. Scrambling aside he looks in fine shape ahead of his eight start in this event, and I am confident new father, Bradley can get his fourth PGA Tour victory and his first in almost six years. At 80/1 I am happy to take a chance on a former top prospect, given his 2nd and 5th place finishes at the CIMB Classic and Farmers Insurance Open respectively this season.
Bradley  ->  positive

Jhonattan Vegas  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($8,700)  It is a bit of a home game for Vegas this week as he attended the University of Texas just two hours down the road. Looking over a quote from last year(via Future of Fantasy Golfanac), Vegas is clearly comfortable playing here and it shows with the results recently as he has T15 and T19 in his last two trips to the Houston Open. He made an early exit from the WGC Match Play last week but did have a T20 at the WGC Mexico at the start of March and has made nine of 11 cuts so far this year so there is even some nice form coming in this time around.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

He’s posted T23/T12/T14 in his last three starts, and sits Top 15 in the field in ball-striking, Par 5s gained, and birdie or better gained over the past 24 rounds. Jamie Lovemark  Generally worse off the tee than than you’d like, but he’s found himself gaining strokes with the smoke wagon again once the tour shifted away from less-than-driver tracks, picking up an average of 2.65 strokes gained off the tee at API and Houston. If that problem’s truly fixed — or at least won’t be a liability — Lovemark’s primed to tear apart TPC San Antonio.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English.
Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Both of those ranks improved as a result of his play in Memphis. Kyle Stanley … Like a Major League Baseball talent with an option remaining and thus returns to Triple-A frequently, he's been a regular "call-up" to this section all season, at least when he hasn't cracked the Power Rankings. A modest 3-for-7 record at TPC River Highlands doesn't tell the entire story since two of those paydays went for a top 20.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor. : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week.
Henley  ->  positive

It's no surprise a player of his calibre got it done. Rather than rest on his laurels now that goal has been ticked off, Mickelson appears far more likely to use it as motivation once more, justifying his selection with another big week which he still needs to qualify for the TOUR Championship. A two-time winner of that event, he will be as keen as ever to get back to East Lake and could yet win the FedEx Cup which, along with that elusive US Open title, is among the few things missing from his packed trophy cabinet.
Mickelson  ->  positive

He will be chalk in the top tier but I think there is more than enough ways to separate yourself with your other five golfers. Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,000)  FanDuel ($8,200)  Rose is another golfer that nails down both the PGA Championship and Wells Fargo Championship history this week. There was a stretch where he missed three straight cuts at the PGA but over the past five years has two Top 5's(2012 & 2015) and has not finished worse than 33rd.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

As we know from experience though this will quite possibly change! PICKS  I have gone with five players this week as follows;  LUKE LIST – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finished 24th  I must confess that the idea of backing a PGA tour maiden at 33-1 was of slight concern to me, however every time I went over the entry list and the accompanying data and stats I ended up with List at the top of the list [no pun intended] and ultimately I felt I just couldn’t leave him out. The case for him this week is a fairly obvious one.
List  ->  positive

However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.

STATS  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Off the Tee  Putting  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Birdie or Better %  Par-5 Scoring  Approach: Outside 175 Yards  Greens in Regulation  Par-3 Scoring  Top-Tier Golfers  Luke List ($9600): Consistently one of the best on Tour from tee to green, List is sure to be a popular pick on DraftKings this year, as he’s having a strong year and his putter is only losing a marginal amount of strokes (-0.051) when compared to years past (-0.426, -0.273 in the previous two years). List finished T3 here last year in shooting -16 over his four rounds and finished T27 in 2016; he did miss the cut with a 77-72 back in 2013, but that’s ancient history for List. This season, List has only missed three cuts (OHL, Sony Open, CareerBuilder) while picking up a whopping seven top-25 finishes in his 14 events.

I'm sure some will follow the trail from Grace to the Dunhill Links and consider both Tyrrell Hatton and Martin Kaymer, former winners of that event, but my final vote is another speculative one in favour of John Peterson. An excellent ball-striker, Peterson led the field in greens as he finished inside the top 20 here on his last visit and, like Poulter, has been playing some good golf since returning from injury. Peterson's results have been more impressive, with two top-25 finishes in his last three starts, and perhaps with a baby on the way he'll find a level of calm on the course that has so far escaped this talented underachiever.
Peterson.  ->  positive

When you weigh it all up its hard not to fancy Rickie’s chances here in Erin Hills. Jon Rahm 20/1  Big hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm has made quite an impact on the PGA Tour this season with a win and seven top 10’s under his belt so far. After shooting a final round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open in February, Rahm bagged his first PGA Tour win at previous US Open venue, Torrey Pines, finishing on 13 under par in total.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

It came across clumsily although essentially he's right with Woods admitting he wasn't tournament ready to play the Masters. The negativity hasn't affected Perez though and, given his numbers (also 7th in both the Money List and FedEx Cup rankings), I'm surprised to see him at 50/1 in this field. Have an each-way punt.
Perez  ->  positive

Jordan improved his game and especially putting during his last start (Genesis Open) on a course (Riviera) that is very comparable to this weeks venue Club de Golf Chapultepec. As far as stats go, Mr. Spieth is checking all the boxes and ranks top 10 in the field in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, Strokes Gained: Approach and also number one in the field in Scrambling. The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups.
Jordan  ->  positive

“Humming” would be putting it lightly for the excellence Fowler has displayed over the past few months, and he will be an absolutely essential consideration at Augusta. Jon Rahm: But guys, he’s tired, right?! Rahm is 22 years old and a golfing machine, carding yet another top-ten at a course he’s never played before.
Jon Rahm:  ->  positive

Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.

Jordan Spieth – $11,000  Even after Spieth’s second place finish last week at the Dean and Deluca, he only has 14 tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to Rahm who has 34. Rahm will soak up so much of Spieth’s ownership, along with the other top names in the field, it is possible we could see a sub 10% number on Spieth. Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week.
Spieth  ->  positive

The weather looks sunny and dry with moderate wind so scoring should be good. Tommy Fleetwood 16/1  The current number 2 in the Race to Dubai is trending in the right direction and judging by last week’s performance in Florida, looks to be hitting the ball nicely coming into this week. He has been playing solid over the last couple of months showing form figures 4,37,6,1,3,6,21,10 in his last eight starts.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

He's still likely to be under-owned in most formats, but he has plenty of upside at a bargain price. -- Zach Turcotte  Luke List  The Arnold Palmer Invitational sets up to be another good spot for Luke List after quality fantasy performances in the Valspar Championship, Honda Classic, Genesis Open, Waste Management Phoenix Open and Farmers Insurance Open. Rating near the top in BOB% and Par-5 Scoring, List should do his fair share of scoring at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge.
Luke List  ->  positive

His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings.

Look for Rickie to get on track for another big Majors run like 2014. J.B. Holmes  World Golf Ranking (#37)  Vegas Odds (33/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,400)  While his stat rankings of 65th in Bogey Avoidance and 9th in BoB% would suggest he is very inconsistent that is far from the truth. He has made the cut in all seven tournaments this season with three Top 25's and Two Top 15 finishes.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

Webb finished T16 at the Players Championship and 5th at the Dean & Deluca Invitational last week, so should he keep trending in the right direction a win should be well within reach. In six starts at this course, Simpson has an 11th (2016), an 8th (2011) and a 48th (2009 debut) as well as three missed cuts. The way he is currently playing, the hope is that he comes here and plays nearer the level he was when 11th here last year and 8th in 2011.
Webb  ->  positive

This is very similar to the form he had shown in his first two starts at the Byron Nelson and hopefully he can improve on the 13th place finish he managed there two starts ago. Finau is a player of immense quality and it is just a matter of time before he adds to his lone PGA Tour victory, that he landed in Puerto Rico last season. From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th).
Finau  ->  positive

Much like Chez Reavie with solid recent performances I would expect Bradley to be cash chalk and feel that this is well deserved. Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times.

If there was a course made to fit Henley's game, it would be this one. Henley also ranks 8th in putting 15-25' and 2nd in Round 1 Scoring. John Huh ($6,500)  Huh comes into The Byron Nelson after missing two of last three cuts.
Henley's  ->  positive

Steals  Johnson Wagner ($7,700)  With harder pricing this week, I don’t think many people will target this range of golfers. If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play. Wagner is notorious for fast starts on Thursdays, and he was finally able to sustain that and post a top-5 finish last weekend.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

Current Form  In Spieth’s six most recent tournaments, he has averaged a monster 103.92 PPT with an amazing +24.54 Plus/Minus and incredible 80 percent Consistency. Spieth’s 67.6 Recent Adjusted Round Score and 27.5 Recent Adjusted Putts Per Round are currently tied for ninth in the Masters field, and his 18.0 Recent Adjusted Birdie Average is tied for fourth. Spieth won the ATT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in mid-February and finished 12th his last time out at the WGC-Mexico Championship.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

Bill Haas ($9,500): Haas is coming in off a two-week rest and he needed it apparently as he missed the cut by a mile his last time out at the Heritage. Still, Haas has been consistent most of the season, with the RBC being his only missed cut over seven starts. With his recent third place at the WGC Match Play event still semi-fresh, I won’t be shocked if Haas puts the confidence gained there to good use this week in a much weaker field.
Haas  ->  positive

Another obvious pointer to his chances at Firestone is that the just-turned 40-year-old is ranked fifth for Par 4 Performance this year. Tied fifth at the Travelers on his last appearance Stateside, I'm hoping this is the week when a few more putts drop at crucial times and Casey is right there on the back nine in Sunday's final round. Finally, one at three-figure odds that enters my head is Kyle Stanley.

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. Webb Simpson is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Simpson’s 69.0 Course Adj Rd Score ranks first among golfers with more than two starts here and sixth overall.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

7th (2013) and 1st at East Lake (2014) across an elite-class field also shows that Horschel likes the rigours of a Donald Ross test. Success here at Sedgefield had been limited with a 30th, 46th, 47th and a MC from 4 appearances until 12 months ago when Horschel off of the back of some indifferent non-Bermuda form, very reminiscent to what we are seeing from him at the moment, finished 5th. Naturally with a Floridian upbringing, this Bermudagrass narrative makes plenty of sense and in this season alone, Horschel has finished 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and 4th at TPC Southwind, with Bermudagrass making up 3 of his 4 top 5 finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

Looking at past winners, Cook's game probably most resembles that of Jason Dufner so the evidence is right there that fairways and greens players can triumph here. Cook won the RSM on just his fourth start with a PGA Tour card so he's clearly got something about him. In fact, even before he got full playing privileges, the 26-year-old showed he had the game for this level.
Cook's  ->  positive

One from the Rough (Sleeper)  Hiroshi Iwata  He was in contention a few months ago at Pebble and almost captured his first PGA Tour win. After his big performance, Iwata registered back-to-back missed cuts, but his play is one that could be a great fit this week in Puerto Rico. 16th in strokes gained putting and  Remember him last year at the PGA?
Hiroshi Iwata  ->  positive

1st for Greens in Regulation, 3rd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green and 6th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green at Kapalua carried on Brian's ball-striking prowess from the autumn. Tie that in with the fact that Harman has found the greens here to his liking on recent visits placing 3rd for Strokes Gained Putting last year and within the top 10 in 2016 and you can see that he has a real chance this week to deliver a much merited win. It's worth remembering that the St Simons Island resident won his maiden title with a -22/262 total at the 2014 John Deere Classic so low scoring is no chore and on a track where Greens in Regulation and Bogey Avoidance is critical, he currently sits 4th and 10th across both PGA Tour skill sets.
Harman  ->  positive

I look at each player's last five events and average their finish positions. DJ had the one missed cut which brings that average just below Molinari's despite winning back to back events(not including Match Play). Molinari hasn't won but has been incredibly consistent with finishes of T22, T33, T7, T20 and T14 over his last five events and has made 10 of 11 cuts this season with three Top 10's and eight Top 25 finishes.
Molinari's  ->  positive

The 25-year-old's final-round 61 to win the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational by five shots on Sunday was an absolute masterclass and the confidence he gained from finishing runner-up in the last major on American soil - June's U.S. Open - would have jumped several more notches. Matsuyama has won two of the last four WGCs by big margins; now it's time to grab a major. Dustin Johnson had two World Golf Championship wins to his credit before making the big breakthrough with victory in last year's US Open so it's fair to see WGCs as a natural stepping stone to the majors.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Put it all together and lineups that are heavy on the chalk (raising my hand) are not as likely to contend for the weekly title as gamers who blend surprise contenders with strong games off the tee. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Waste Management Phoenix Open (in alphabetical order):  Tony Finau  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  Webb Simpson  Jordan Spieth  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks.

LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th. At best however if you catch Lucas on the right week, in tough conditions, with ball striking at a premium and a few putts drop, he is still a class act and can get right in the hunt and, as a three time winner on tour including a US Open, he does know how to win a golf tournament!
Glover.  ->  positive

He has missed his last two cuts and hasn’t played since the Travelers. There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood – $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan.
Day  ->  negative

His Masters play-off defeat came on the back of three missed cuts at Augusta and he went on to miss another in 2013, but since then Oosthuizen's form figures of 25-T19-T15 show encouraging progression and confirm that his near-miss was no flash-in-the-pan. Unlike Leishman and Fowler, he doesn't have a recent victory to call upon but Oosthuizen is a relaxed character who will recognise that third in Phoenix, fifth in Perth and a run of solid performances elsewhere, including at the Match Play, represents a perfectly solid preparation for the season's first major. Last year he drove the ball wonderfully well here, ranking ninth in distance and third in accuracy, and it's now three visits in four that he's found upwards of 65 percent of greens, twice leading the entire field in ball-striking, twice in total driving, and once in the all-around.
Leishman  ->  positive

Wait until he puts at least a couple good rounds under his belt. Jimmy Walker – $7,600  It’s very unfortunate to watch, but the decline of Jimmy Walker is tough to watch. He has now missed four straight cuts, and last week’s Sony Open might be the most eye opening.
Jimmy Walker  ->  negative

He has three WGC wins in his career. Johnson has the highest salary and best odds to win the tournament (13.3 percent) this week. DJ has played reasonably well in comparable spots:  In addition to producing a +6.0 Plus/Minus with 63.6 percent Consistency across the sample, he’s also scored at least 95 DraftKings points in six of eleven tournaments.
DJ  ->  positive

Pebble Beach is my favourite, that’s my favourite course ever, but this course is in awesome shape and like I said, the weather is, this is as good as it gets in golf.”  Hadley ticks some key statistical boxes here ranking 37th in GIR, sixth in SGTTG, 37th in SG putting, first in par 3 scoring, 38th in par 4 scoring and 27th in par 5 scoring.

You might want to try an avoid guys playing Spyglass on a rough day as it tends to be the most difficult and can really take a golfer out of the tournament. The Tiers  $12,000 - $10,000  CASH: He was our GPP play last week but this week for cash I am going straight to the top with Jordan Spieth. Spieth comes into Pebble with great form having posted a 9th last week after getting off to a rocky start was able to find his groove and surge on the weekend with two prior 3rd places in the fall.. Jordan's game is well suited for this event and he is sneaky long enough to hit the big par 5's in two.
Jordan  ->  positive

Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory.
Casey  ->  positive

He's got 10 million reasons to play well. Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017.
Spieth  ->  positive

That means that he can spend 100% of his time focusing on one thing and one thing alone, and I can imagine that he intends to do just that. The final point I’ll make about Stanley is that he’s been exceptional regardless of the difficulty of the stage. He showed up with a T6 at Muirfield, T4 at Sawgrass, T8 at the SHO, T17 at the API, and finished in the top 25 at the NTO, Dell, and Tour Championship.
Stanley  ->  positive

Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000. Generally, I’d go a little further down the favorites list for this pick but I think Rahm has a legitimate chance to win this week. He already has a win and five top 25s in his first full season on Tour and ranks 5th in Shots Gained Off the Tee.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

(2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round.
Trey Mullinax,  ->  positive

Greens in regulation will be a key stat here along with approaches, strokes gained putting, scrambling, par 4 and par 5 scoring. Jordan Spieth 7/1  I don’t know what it is about Augusta but it seems to really suit Jordan Spieth. Despite missing the cut last week in Houston, Spieth has been in great form with a win and five top 25’s in his last seven starts.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Jimmy Walker ($6,500)  Let’s be honest, in an 18-man field there’s not really any “sleeper” picks. Still, I do think Jimmy Walker could go under the radar due to his poor recent form. Walker has had a strange if not marvelous 2016.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

He’s a great value at this price. Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential.
Rahm  ->  positive

Especially with the softer pricing on FanDuel, you can easily afford Rahm and still make a great cash game team. Ownership in GPP’s will be the question to figure out in deciding if you want to be overweight or underweight on Rahm and we have you covered here at dfsarmy.com with our research station ownership projections for VIP members. Chez Reavie – All Formats – DK: $8800 FD: $9400  Reavie continued his string of recent performances with a T18 last week at the Sony Open.
Rahm  ->  positive

Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Russell Knox.  ->  positive

Since he's a long hitter, his scoring stats are strong on par 4s and par 5s. His birdie average of 3.89 per round is strong, especially considering his price point, and unless he ends up with Dustin Johnson, Rahm or Justin Thomas, he'll be have a great opportunity to upset a bracket. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks (for the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship)  Eric Axley  There are events each year where the field is a little bit weak, and then there are fields that are just barely above what we would see at a Web.com Tour event with not even enough names at the top to have big favorites overall.
Rahm  ->  positive

Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
Walker  ->  positive

All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays. In terms of correlating course form, Simpson has results everywhere you want to see them and it's also good to see that he has excellent Champion Bermudagrass results across both TPC Southwind (3rd 2014) and Sedgefield Country Club (5th 2014, 6th 2015, 3rd 2017). RESULT: T21  Tony Finau 1.5pts EW 45/1 with £/€20 risk-free bet* for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (8 EW, 1/5 odds):  Big names at the top of the betting have created bigger prices for some form players and I like the look of Tony Finau this week.
Simpson  ->  positive

A no-cut, limited field means that you need to find points and find points often. I’ll take you through some viable cash options as we open up the season:  Russell Henley, 7800: Henley hasn’t played here since 2015 and that included a T3 showing, but had been playing well towards the end of last season with a third place finish at the Tour Championship. Henley sits fifth in SG Approach and tenth in DK points in his last eight rounds at Kapalau.
Henley,  ->  positive

He is a four-time PGA Tour winner that hasn't won since the 2007 Viking Classic but is playing some of his best golf of this season right now. Since missing the cut at the PLAYERS, Campbell has made the weekend in five of his last six tournaments with four Top 25 finishes. He also ranks 13th on my sheet in average DK points over his last five tournaments.
Campbell  ->  positive

Walker endured a 36-hole finale at Baltusrol, shooting 68-67 on the final day to hold off Jason Day’s late charge and win his first major title. Walker’s starting to hit peak form ahead of this week’s PGA Championship, racking up top-30 finishes in two of his last three starts. He even held the 36-hole lead at Firestone last week before settling for a 28th-place finish at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational.
Walker’s  ->  positive

The final hole is a tough par four (second toughest the last two years) so a par is by no means a given there. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth heads the market and rightly so. After a somewhat subdued 2016, he's started 2017 well and he was a big eye-catcher at the Sony Open, where he ranked first for Greens In Regulation when finishing third behind his good friend, Justin Thomas.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

T13 finishes at both the RSM Classic and the Sony Open earlier on this season prove he likes these short, wind-affected courses and hopefully he will continue his form on a similar layout this week. Last season, List’s two best finishes of the season came at the CareerBuilder Challenge (T6), where two of the three courses are Pete Dye designs and the Honda Classic (T10) which is also well known for its windy conditions. If List is going to get off the mark on the PGA Tour anytime soon, he is going to want to ride these patches of form he is going through, and he can go again after that T3 finish two weeks ago.
List’s  ->  positive

That solid core of play both with tee shots and approach shots is magnified on the basis that East Lake always ranks in the top 15 or so for scrambling difficulty on the PGA Tour. Winners : 2016: Rory McIlroy (-12); 2015: Jordan Spieth (-9); 2014: Billy Horschel (-11); 2013: Henrik Stenson (-13); 2012: Brandt Snedeker (-10); 2011: Bill Haas (-9); 2010: Jim Furyk (-8). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Selection    Marc Leishman could only finish 28th on his only previous appearance at East Lake - back in 2009 - but I'm happy to ignore that given the positive stats for BMW winners and given how well he's playing. Had DJ gone on to win last year, four of the ten BMW winners would have doubled up here and Leishman reminds me of two of the three winners that have doubled up since the tournament became the FedEx Cup finale...    Villegas had form figures reading 21-3-1 before doubling up here in 2008 and Horschel's read MC-2-1 in 2014. Leishman's read MC-3-1 and he has a similar profile to the other too as well.
Leishman  ->  positive

This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Johnson  ->  positive

While he hasn’t registered a win on the year, a T5 at the U.S. Open and top-five placings at both the WGC China event and the WGC Match Play are definitely worth noting. Haas has played Firestone seven times over his career, and he has two finishes inside the top 20, with his career best being a T7 back in 2013. It’s worth noting, however, that Haas does seem to set up well for the course based on his season-long stats which include ranking sixth in Par 4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards and also being inside the top-10 in Bogey Avoidance.
Haas  ->  positive

I really like how he sets up, considering he's a known plodder and this course demands patience from start to finish. Jason Rouslin -- Luke Donald ($7,500)  A guy that might be peaking at the right time, Donald enters The Barclays coming off of a second-place finish at the Wyndham. This week he returns to Bethpage where he found success in 2012, coming in 10th.
Donald  ->  positive

Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Brendan  ->  positive

He’s been money for fantasy over the past month or so and I see no reason to hop off at what is still a decent price. Others: Tony Finau, Justin Thomas  Values  Anirban Lahiri ($7,500): Lahiri is coming off a monster performance at the Memorial where he demolished the course in his final round with a bogey free seven under; gaining five strokes over the field on approaches alone in that round. This will be his first time seeing TPC River Highlands but the fact he ranks 9th in Birdie or Better percentage and 16th in par 4 Birdie or Better Percentage means he should be taken seriously in DFS this week.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

Bonus  Pro Trends: 13, Adam Scott ($10,100)  Scott currently leads all players in the field with 13 Pro Trends, one of which is a Rec GIR of at least 75. Scott’s 29.9 PPR average through his last three events is atrocious, but it is only 0.1 PPR more than his LT average. He excels by being one of the best ball strikers in the game, and right now his Rec GIR of 78.2 percent shows that he has been getting it done recently.
Scott  ->  positive

($7,200) four straight made cuts, ninth in SG: Around the Green. Brian Gay ($7,100) former winner, 16th in SG: Around the Green. ($7,100) former winner, 16th in SG: Around the Green.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

Given that he probably putts best on bermuda greens and has shown definite improvement across the last two FedEx Cup events, Garcia is both playing well enough and suitably under-the-radar to put his experience to use at a course which is always capable of catching out the fearless aggression of youth. Since his last start here in 2014, Garcia has really stepped up a level and he's been winning in high-class company. The players who've finished second to him this season are both major champions, while the player he beat in a play-off for last year's PGA Tour win has since become one.
Garcia  ->  positive

He has also been good here at the Houston Open with made cuts in four of his last five events including a T15 last year, T5 in 2015, and T10 in 2013. Emiliano Grillo  World Golf Ranking (#75)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,500)  FanDuel ($9,000)  Grillo is coming off a disappointing T50 last in Puntacana when he was priced as a Top 3 player and expected to be on the final page of the leaderboard on Sunday. That alone will help with the ownership this week in GPP formats but I also trust him in cash games as well.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

Will he just be turning up for a whack or could he shoot the lights out with no pressure on? Jordan Spieth - 11/2    Spieth won this by 10 shots when it was played at Isleworth in 2015, finishing 26 shots in front of last-placed Tiger. When defending at Albany, this week's venue, last year the two-time major winner shot rounds of 67-66-68-67 to finish solo fourth, five back from Bubba.
Spieth  ->  positive

The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
Blayne Barber  ->  negative

My selections are as follows:  Bubba Watson 1.5pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Bubba Watson makes a lot of sense this week and with Day, McIlroy and Spieth all in the field, it's great to see 33/1 about the 2-time Travelers champion. Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner.
Bubba  ->  positive

In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price).

Last four events: 43-14-37-MC  Course form: 11-MC-12-5-38-27-38  Last 10 majors: 5-22-5-11-33-46-MC-MC-30-30  Last 50 starts - Win: 2%, Top 5: 22%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  I couldn't quite pull the trigger on Justin Rose in the outright market but I have no hesitation making him my best top 10 punt here. Rose has the most robust greens in regulation stats at Augusta National of any player in the field this week and that will get you the top 10s. He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another.
Rose  ->  positive

The Korean was T49 on debut here last year. Final Bet: Back Sam Saunders EW @ 125/1  At the top of the market, Jordan Spieth is a former winner but his build towards Augusta is rather a slow one and form of 14-9-20 in his last three starts is more that of a fine player in good form rather than the elite performer we know him to be. Valspar first-timer Rory McIlroy has been underwhelming since his fast start to the year in the Middle East and I've probably run out of patience with Paul Casey for the time being in the outright market.
Sam Saunders  ->  positive

Spieth has struggled off the tee this year, but leads the field in Strokes Gained: Approach and is 5th in Par 3 Birdie or Better so far this year. Most DraftKings players will have to make a decision between Spieth and Johnson. Spieth is the better cash game play this week in my opinion.
Spieth  ->  positive

Berger  ->  positive

Watney made the cut in his first event back at the Safeway a few weeks ago and arrives this week at a course where he has tremendous history, making six straight cuts with five finishes in the top 16. Jason Rouslin -- Ben Martin ($7,600)  Martin will look to have a soild start to his 2016-2017 season and make it all the way to the Tour Championship after he was knocked out at the BMW last season. He comes off the Sanderson where he placed 18th, and comes back to TPC Sumerlin where he won in 2014.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

All in all though he’s not for me at the price, and I shall continue to watch his progress as a fascinated bystander. So on to this week’s picks and it’s five for me as follows;  JUSTIN ROSE – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 3rd  I shall say straight of the bat that I’m not really looking to reinvent the wheel with my picks this week and first up for me is Justin Rose. The case for Rose is a pretty obvious one this week and one thing Tiger’s presence at the top of the market does do is create a more than fair e/w price for the Englishman.
Rose.  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
Tommy  ->  positive

It’s also a Pete Dye course design so fire up the typical plodders and target practice golfers >> Donald, Duke, Furyk, Casey, etc…(sadly, no Kuch or Haas this week). Key Stats:  SG: Approach  SG: Off the Tee  Par 4 Scoring  GIR+  Birdie or Better %/Bogey Avoidance  Key Draftkings Targets:  Jordan Spieth 11.4k  Paul Casey 9.7k  Marc Leishman 9.3k  Tony Finau 8.7k  Kyle Stanley 8.6k  Charley Hoffman 7.3k  Webb Simpson 6.9k  Outright Bets:  Patrick Reed 28/1  Brendan Steele 33/1  Bubba Watson 35/1  Bud Cauley 45/1  Kyle Stanley 45/1  Jaime Lovemark 80/1  Kevin Tway 80/1  U.S. OPEN RECAP  Well, it wasn’t the 6/6 I was hoping for but those were few and far between and as you can see my 4/6 still managed to cash for $1,000 in the $333 Club Pro. Normally, I play my single bullet/top LU but I was feeling pretty good so stepped it up.
Casey,  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler 22/1  Granted, this one is a bit of a risk but I think it’s one worth taking on Rickie Fowler here. Fowler is playing decent golf lately and as I mentioned in my preview last week, he got the psychological relief of a win in Florida a couple of weeks ago at the Honda Classic which takes some of the pressure off a bit. He has been in good form so far this year with a T3 at the Hero World Challenge, T4 in Phoenix, T16 at the WGC Mexico, solo 12th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and a T3 last week in Houston.
Fowler  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – St. Jude Classic  Lock of the week:  Francesco Molinari $10,500 – We’ve seen a mixed bag of winners here at TPC Southwind as there have been both accuracy guys and bombers that have prevailed to win this championship. However, Molinari can win on either for the results he has been producing lately. He’s consistently played well all year making 10/11 cuts with three T10s.
Molinari  ->  positive

All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year. Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches.
Morgan Hoffmann  ->  positive

-- Jeff Bergerson  Tony Finau  Finau grades out very well for the Farmers Insurance Open, with his long game obviously a great fit on both courses. From a course history perspective, Finau has finishes of T-24, T-18 and T-4 from 2015 to 2017 (in that order), and he enters the week off five-straight made cuts in the 2018 season with a second-place finish at the Safeway and a T-32 at the Sony Open. In 2017, he was one of the best players on tour off the tee and in approach play while dominating with the long irons, posting a combined -82 relative to par from outside 175 yards.
Finau  ->  positive

Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
McIlroy  ->  negative

At 36, whilst he is no spring chicken, he still has ten or more years ahead of him if he can find add some consistency to his game. James Hahn 200/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  James Hahn is another player of top quality, even if he to struggles with consistency. Hahn beat two top-class opponents, in Dustin Johnson and Paul Casey in a play-off at Riviera in 2015, and also got the better of Roberto Castro at the 2016 Wells Fargo Championship.
James Hahn  ->  positive

The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner. The aforementioned partner, Daniel Berger, is an excellent scrambler (24th) if the pairing struggle on approach, and himself is an excellent putter.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  MY PICK : Louis Oosthuzien ($9,100)  Oosthuizen started the playoffs strong last week with a T10. While he was somewhat wild off the tee at Glen Oaks, Oosthuizen’s approach game was on point as he gained over 4.2 strokes on the field in approaches and was T3 for the week in Greens in Regulation. The South African has come close to winning multiple times this year in strong field events, and the venue this week clearly speaks to him as he’s landed finishes of T12-T8-T2 at TPC Boston over his last three appearances – a record which includes six of his last 12 rounds being 67 or better.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Here are my selections for the 2017 BMW Championship. Justin Rose 33/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Justin Rose has not had the best of season’s by his own high standards, but it is important to remember the Englishman was runner-up to Sergio Garcia at the Masters back in April and has contended again since as well. Since Augusta, a couple of missed cuts and three finishes of T54 or worse have clouded the year for Rose.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.
Reed.  ->  positive

He trails only Matsuyama and Chez Reavie with his 19.5 Recent Birdie Average. Ross Fisher: I’ll leave some really contrarian picks for Kelly’s Five Under Five piece on Wednesday, but I do want to highlight Fisher, who is currently projected at just five to eight percent ownership. He’s an excellent play — his 304.6-yard Recent DD is good enough, and he came in 10th last time he played Quail Hollow — and non-PGA members could be undervalued.
Fisher:  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm? Cantlay’s LT Adj Rd Score (68.5) is tied for fifth, while his LT GIR percentage (69.7) is tied for 16th and LT Adj Bird Avg (15.4) ranks seventh.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

This brings us to Luke Donald at the RBC Heritage. For one, as rapidly as you want to connect dots between fellow 40somethings/Englishmen Paul Casey and Ian Poulter, both of whom recent winners of PGA TOUR events, and even World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship winner Phil Mickelson, also a contemporary, none of them possessed the kind of epic course history at the sites of their titles as Donald has at Harbour Town Golf Links. It's a relevant narrative to carry a casual conversation, but it's an improper fantasy angle.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Mori Yoshimoto  @Bears3423    Last Week: 348.5 points  Last Week Rank: 5,177    Kevin Na ($29,500)  William McGirt ($29,000)  Lucas Glover ($15,700)  Kyle Stanley ($12,200)  Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)  John Peterson ($4,300)    ANALYSIS: Ball-striking is the name of the game here for Mo. If Valspar proves to be a worthy pointer like it often does than Cantlay's runner-up finish there looks even better. Yahoo!
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He’s missed the cut the last to years at this place. Aside from Kapalua, Thomas has been playing well. But this course doesn’t seem to fit him and it’s tough not to be weary of a streaky guy on a track that hasn’t suited him.
Thomas  ->  negative

He sprays it off the tee without much distance, and the best part of his game is his scrambling and putting. Webb Simpson ($8,200)  Simpson is perhaps a perfect pivot off of Reed at this price because statistically he’s exactly what you’re looking for here. His approach game- especially out of the rough- is top tier and his entire tee to green game is solid.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Despite limited opportunities and five missed cuts in his last six starts he still ranks 39th on tour for ball-striking and should enjoy this week’s test. Schauffele made the cut at the OHL Classic and a second round 63 was very encouraging. He also finished T5 at the Sanderson Farms Championship so there are plenty of positives if you go far enough back.
Schauffele  ->  positive

He is one of just six golfers in the entire field that rank Top 20 in my stats model, five-year course history ranks and current form ranks. After missing the cut at the Masters in 2010 and then again in 2012, Casey didn't play the following two years. He returned in a big way the past two years with finishes of T6 and T4 and is poised for another strong finish this year.
Casey  ->  positive

McGirt also covers the Riviera base - he was sixth there in 2014, 14th in 2015 and 20th in 2016 - but this shorter par 70 is even better for his game and at 110/1, he looks the standout each-way bet. Kevin Na is another short hitter who should benefit for the drop in trip of around 1,000 yards after a respectable T32 in the US Open. Na was the subject of much discussion after bemoaning the length of the rough at Erin Hills, but once the talking was over he outperformed even his own expectations with three solid rounds, none more so than an opening 68.
Na  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – Wyndham Championship  Lock of the week:  Kevin Kisner – $11,300 –Kiz is the type of guy that will take a crappy Sunday like the one he had at the PGA Championship and turn it into pure fire the next week. He’s going to be eager to get out there and prove himself after his tough final round of 74. The former University of Georgia Bulldog ranks high in the field in three key stats for us this week; Good Drives: Gained, Par 4 Scoring, & DraftKings scoring.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Spieth’s lacklustre figures in Putting and Off the Tee are slightly negated by his hugely impressive Approach-the-Green (1st) and Tee-to-Green (10th) numbers. Spieth also ranks 4th in Par 5 Scoring Average which may well come into play at this Par 72 track. Another pleasing statistic is that he ranks T4 in Par 4 Birdies or Better, so even during a “lull in form” Spieth still ranks highly in a lot of key areas.
Spieth  ->  positive

Moreover, he has made nine straight cuts and has seven top-25 finishes during that stretch. Adam Hadwin: Hadwin has only played here twice, but he hasn’t finished worse than 22nd in either appearance. Hadwin’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score is 10th, his 60.6 LT SC percentage is 19th, and his 14.4 LT Adj Bird Avg ranks ninth in the field.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

Throwing Darts  Charl Schwartzel: $7,600  32nd in strokes gained: approach-the-green. 37th in strokes gained: total, Schwartzel is a quality play at the $7,600 price point. He wasn't in the field at Conway Farms in 2013 or 2015, but T29 and T25 finishes in the first two Playoff Events are indicative of good form.
Charl Schwartzel:  ->  positive

Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again. A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

E-Mail Exclusive Picks (FREE, sign up for our newsletter to receive it as well as exclusive discount codes!) HONDA CLASSIC RECAP    Last Week’s Cash Plays  Must Play  Russell Knox ($9,000) – MC  Rafa Cabrera-Bello ($8,000) – T37  Majority of Cash Lines  Branden Grace ($7,900) – WD  Charles Howell III ($7,800) – T52  Kevin Kisner ($7,700) – T48  Paul Casey ($8,600) – T11  Brendan Steele ($8,100) – T14  Jason Dufner ($7,500) – T14  Gary Woodland ($8,300) – T2  Hedge (Minority of Cash Lines)  Sergio Garcia ($10,900) – T14  J.J. Spaun ($6,700) – T21  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,500) – T4  Thomas Pieters ($7,700) – MC  Daniel Berger ($8,900) – MC  So let’s just start by saying that up until Sunday, PGA National played about as easy as the tournament directors can set it up, which means that there is reasonable cause for concern regarding guys who blew the cut by more than a shot or two, starting with the usually-consistent Russell Knox. Although he wasn’t necessarily cheap, $9K seemed like a pretty good bargain for a guy who has a sterling track record at this event and simply could not set up much better for the course even from a theoretical level where ball-striking is an absolute essential.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Stanley has played the Bridgestone only once before, but he did well, tying for 16th in 2012. Brendan Steele - $6,700 (125-1)    Steele surely has cooled off from earlier in the season, in part because he's cut down on his schedule. But he was top-15 at the U.S. Open and followed that up with another top-15 the next week at the Travelers.
Steele  ->  positive

He's a past champion here, a Texas native, and a Lone Star State specialist. In addition to his win in 2015, Walker has posted 3rd, 13th, and 16th place finishes here at TPC San Antonio. Last we saw of Walker, he posted three straight rounds under par at Augusta to finish inside the top-20.
Walker  ->  positive

I'd expect the eventual semi-finalist to come from the bottom half of the quarter though and to that end I'm backing Patrick Reed to be the player to prevail. Opponents Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel have both been off the boil of late - the Chinese star has finished outside of the top-50 on each of his starts since winning in Dubai and the former Masters Champion hasn't managed a top-10 globally since June of last year - which leaves Jordan Spieth as Reed's biggest challenge. Of course Spieth is well capable of finding the putting form that saw him rise to the top of the world rankings back in 2015-2016, however the process changes he's been making with the flat stick are yet to bed in fully and that leaves the door open for an aggressive player like Patrick Reed to take full advantage.
Reed  ->  positive

His performance last week at a claustrophobic Harbour Town set-up, which doesn't suit him in my mind, was also quietly impressive. 68-68 was good enough for 13th after 36 holes, but Schauffele ultimately needs a more open course where he can use his undoubted strengths. 16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor. : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week.
Henley  ->  positive

Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
Rahm  ->  negative

Taking advantage of the four easiest holes at Augusta is, as mentioned, really important and while par-five performance has long been something of an issue for Haas, there's evidence to suggest he's getting to grips with this particular set. Finally, for one at such a price and without a major in the bag, Haas does have a heck of a lot of top-level form including his 2011 FedEx Cup success, which came here in Georgia, and three Presidents Cup appearances which he's desperate to add to with a fourth at Liberty National later this year. He's also won at Riviera and Congressional, two classical layouts with more than a passing resemblance to Augusta and form ties too, and I'm increasingly sweet on the idea that Haas could follow his great-uncle Bob Goalby and win the Masters.
Haas,  ->  positive

Mastsuyama has been great at Riviera too: In three career starts he has never finished outside the top 25 and has posted 11th- and fourth-place finishes the past two years. Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice.
Johnson  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan – DK: $6800 FD: $5200  He is not much of a birdie maker but Bryan is underpriced based on ability and is a sneaky course fit. In his short PGA career, Bryan has found success on short, easy golf courses. His win at the RBC Heritage came at a par 71, 7081-yard course.
Bryan  ->  positive

Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
Padraig Harrington’s  ->  negative

Although he won’t go under the radar in terms of ownership (by any stretch), it’s important to reiterate his talents that translate to this course:  1 st in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach T1 in Bogey Avoidance  2 nd in Birdie or Better %  in Birdie or Better % 5th in Par-4 Scoring  Although the flat stick hasn’t been up to his typical world-beating standards, Spieth still sits 31st in SG: Putting, and his poor ranking for putts made inside 10-15’ is easily explained by small sample size. Just like Thomas, with the driver out of his hand this week, Spieth has a great opportunity to win just on approach alone. The Fade  Just a small note here – I play one lineup, so every week I’m fading the full field minus six, just by virtue of only using one lineup.
Spieth  ->  positive

Steve Bamford's Tips for the 2018 Farmers Insurance Open . Follow Steve on twitter: @bamfordgolf  Tommy Fleetwood and Jon Rahm produced wins last week at 22/1 and 10/1 respectively. Both victories were ominously impressive, with Fleetwood moving to World Number 12 after successfully defending his Abu Dhabi title and delivering another great winner for our European Tour previewer Paul Williams.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title. With a T4 finish on his most recent start here, as well as some decent finishes under his belt this season, I thought Piller was worth a bet at a big price, in the hope he can find a win the top-level, for the first time.
Piller  ->  positive

He cited allergies as the cause of his withdrawal then rolled up at Augusta next time out and won the US Masters for a second time. As is typical with the wildly unpredictable Bubba, there have also been three missed cuts here but there have also been renewals in which Watson has shown that he has exactly the right game for the venue. In ten previous visits, his best finishes are an eighth ten years ago and a fourth in 2012 and he's sat inside the top-seven places after round one on three previous occasions.
Watson  ->  positive

The 2011 winner, Charl Schwartzel, hadn't been in stellar really recent form but he'd won on the European Tour three months before he won the Masters. Bubba Watson had finished second at the WGC-Cadillac Championship (now the WGC-Mexico Championship) and fourth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational before he won the first of his two titles in 2012. Adam Scott had been third in the WGC-Cadillac in his penultimate start before his 2013 victory.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

More on the Euros below but, as for the other Americans, Rickie Fowler was 18/1 when winning last year so the 15/2 for a defence looks grim. Justin Thomas has curious course form of MC-3-MC but the middle one shows that he can tame this track and the US PGA champ has to rank as a big threat after showing some good signs when T9 at Riviera on Sunday. Gary Woodland is very capable of scoring a quick follow-up to his Phoenix win, especially when you consider he was runner-up in last year's Honda Classic and T6 in 2011.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

While genuine shocks are fairly rare at Augusta, increasingly so of late, the top-heavy nature of the market means that there are some candidates at 100/1 and upwards who appear to have a chance to contend. The pick of them is Bill Haas, and while his overall play in majors is a nagging concern in that he's been consistently on the fringes but never in the mix, at three-figure prices there's a pretty compelling case to be made for him. For starters, Haas is in great form.
Bill Haas,  ->  positive

After running the world's top 40 players through all those qualification criteria, only five players survive. They are: Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia, Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell. Another stat:  Nine of the last 10 US Open winners were not the Masters champion  Sorry Sergio.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

Whilst he missed the cut on his sole start here, back in 2014, the Fort Worth resident finished T11 at the Valero Texas Open one year later and he can feature atop a Texas leaderboard once again, this week. Statistically, Peterson looks good in the right areas for this event. Although these stats will be slightly inflated due to his limited starts (8), they are impressive, nonetheless.
Peterson  ->  positive

Other: Charl Schwartzel  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Jason Dufner, Tony Finau, Byeong Hun-An, Louis Oosthuzien, Kevin Tway  – Sung Kang, Xander Schauffele, DA Points, Charl Schwartzel, Nick Taylor, Ollie Schniederjans, Zac Blair  Bets:  Louis Oosthuizen 33-1  Byeong Hun An 67-1 ew  Sung Kang 70-1 ew  Xander Schauffele 140-1 ew I think his recent play and the set-up at this venue could lead to a monster week and I really like him at only $6,600 for play in big tournaments on DraftKings. Schauffele can bomb it off the tee (29th in Driving Distance) and also ranks very highly in par 4 scoring, including ranking second in efficiency on holes from 450-500 yards.

Since that second place finish Luke has continued the good form with further stroke play finishes of 16th and 7th and this week he now returns to a venue he performed well at last year when finishing 3rd. There is evidence over the years that aggressive bomber types are rewarded at the Golf Club of Houston with past winners JB Holmes, Mickelson, Kim and Casey all falling in that category and therefore it no surprise that List has played well here over the past two years and I am confident he has another big week ahead of him this week. KEEGAN BRADLEY – 55-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finshed 43rd  Keegan Bradley has been knocking on the door of a comeback win for a while now and I can see him having another big showing this week.
Luke  ->  positive

Greens in regulation will be a key stat here along with approaches, strokes gained putting, scrambling, par 4 and par 5 scoring. Jordan Spieth 7/1  I don’t know what it is about Augusta but it seems to really suit Jordan Spieth. Despite missing the cut last week in Houston, Spieth has been in great form with a win and five top 25’s in his last seven starts.
Spieth  ->  positive

He ranks 5th in my weighted rankings, driven by his three straight top 20 finishes. Over his last 12 rounds, Campbell ranks 18th in SG:APP and is the 2nd best scrambler in the field for the year. There is no reason to believe a finish outside of the top 20 is in the cards this week.
Campbell  ->  positive

With that in mind, last year’s result is definitely the one for me to focus on. So far, Lovemark has made a steady start to the 2016/17 season, with a top-10 and a top-20 to his name already in his first five starts. He finished T20 at the Safeway Open, his first start of the season and on his most recent start, at the RSM Classic finished T6.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Outsider: Back Lucas Glover EW @ 150/1  We've done well with the long-shots in recent weeks with 200/1 Scott Stallings grabbing full each-way return at Pebble Beach and 100/1 Martin Laird missing out on a place by a single shot at Riviera. So let's try another triple-figure punt with 150/1 chance Lucas Glover. It's been a long time between drinks but all three of his PGA Tour wins have come over on his native East Coast and that includes the 2011 U.S. Open which he won with 4-under.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

He’s an athletic gamer who thrives on the grandest of stages, placing no worse than T21 in his last nine major tournaments. Koepka ranks sixth on Tour in both driving distance and birdie average, and he’s quietly T10 in SG: Putting as well. Glue Guys    Thomas Pieters - $14,900    The “Belgian Bomber” is up to a career-best 23rd in the Official World Golf Ranking after a fourth-place finish at the Bridgestone, where he had a share of the lead heading into Sunday’s final round.
Koepka  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay ($9,100) and Ollie Schniederjans ($7,400) are two other young American golfers who finished in the top five here last season and easily could replicate that feat again. Other names to consider for this format include: Emiliano Grillo ($8,600), Ryan Moore ($8,500), Matthew Fitzpatrick ($7,600), Si Woo Kim ($7,400), Charl Schwartzel ($7,300) and Bud Cauley ($7,300). Top Recent Form  1.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

I'm more than willing to take on board some unknowns in exchange for a big price about a player who will surely go close in this event many times over the next decade or so. Matsuyama has been a regular major contender ever since turning professional and I'm hopeful he can reach the frame once more. Ryan Moore, Jimmy Walker and Gary Woodland are three outsiders for whom a case can be made, while Kuchar looks good at 50/1 if your primary concern is the place part of the wager.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He has been playing some decent golf over the last couple of months with five top 11’s and a win in his last eight competitive starts. Day finished in a respectable T9 at the PGA Championship back in August followed by a T6 at the Northern Trust Open in Glen Oaks shooting a 69 or better in three of his four rounds. The Aussie then travelled to the BMW Championship in Conway Farms finishing solo fourth which included an opening 64 and a second round 65.
Day  ->  positive

Firstly, he has some Royal Birkdale pedigree having taken T7 there in 2008, an Open finish he’s only beaten once (T3 at St. Andrews in 2010). He’s not played well in this event since but some strong form this year, including 6th at Augusta National, 26th in the U.S. Open and T5 at the Travelers on his most recent start, suggests a challenge is brewing  Alex Noren  The defense of his Scottish Open crown didn’t go well (missed cut) but pulling the camera back a little to get a wider picture shows that he has a win (at Wentworth thanks to a closing 62), two top 10s (PLAYERS Championship and Open de France) and a T15 (Nordea Masters) in his last six starts. The Swede has played well, indeed won, in windy conditions and it’s notable that he was T19 on his Open debut at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and that included a double bogey at the 72nd hole.
Noren  ->  positive

Mickelson spoke afterwards of some real off-course struggles this year, including severe fatigue, but says he's on the right track now and relieved to finally get rewarded for his hard work. Statistically, Mickelson was really close to his absolute best last time and despite a stop-start season, he yet again ranks inside the PGA Tour's top 20 in birdie average. Phil Mickelson  If low-scoring is indeed the order of the day, he's going to be suited by conditions and it's no surprise that the relatively straightforward test of Boston helped him find comfort where it had so obviously been lacking since his split with Jim 'Bones' Mackay.
Mickelson  ->  positive

1. Adam Scott, Australia -- Coming off a tie for fourth in The Barclays to open the FedEx Cup playoffs, Scott might be ready to win again, especially if he can make a few more putts. He climbed to fourth in the point standings by playing more like he did earlier this season, when he won the Honda Classic and the WGC-Cadillac Championship on consecutive weeks.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

Due to the wraparound season, they all count on this year's FedEx Cup and the American left-hander sits 13th on that list. After adding another top 20 at the CareerBuilder, Harman missed the cut at Torrey Pines and has then sat out the last few weeks to prep for the Florida Swing. He has some startling history at the Honda Classic having posted a ludicrous 61 in the second round in 2012, a course record which helped him finish tied 12th.
Harman  ->  positive

But as he remains without a major, and with DJ, Spieth and McIlroy forming such a strong trinity at the top of the market, we're still able to take upwards of 20/1 about a player who simply looks ready for the next step. Following what might prove an ideal prep in Houston, where in rain-softened conditions he was in electric form for much of the week and finished with a flourish, Fowler looks the best bet at the Masters. While genuine shocks are fairly rare at Augusta, increasingly so of late, the top-heavy nature of the market means that there are some candidates at 100/1 and upwards who appear to have a chance to contend.
Fowler  ->  positive

Garrigus famously lost the plot to hand the St Jude Classic to Lee Westwood in 2010, and he’s been placed here at Copperhead on two of his last four visits. He puts his success here in Florida down to the fact he can go fishing inbetween rounds and with a new putter in the bag that he says he will never consider changing, Garrigus seems to be in a good place to double his career tally. That first win also came in Florida and more recently he’s caught the eye a number of times, notably when missing a short eagle putt which would’ve put him in the lead on Sunday at the CareerBuilder Challenge, which confirms that an eventual share of 17th doesn’t tell the whole story.
Garrigus  ->  positive

As only the fifth most expensive player, I think Sergio is decent value this week and gets my nod as the strongest DraftKings play among the top group. MY SLEEPER : Russell Henley ($7,000)  Henley is in the midst of his best season on tour and makes for an excellent target this week, on a course which should suit his game extremely well. The Georgia native won earlier in the season and has found some decent form recently too, including a T5 in his last start at the Greenbrier.
Henley  ->  positive

While he has yet to take home the hardware here at the RBC Heritage, he has come close a ton of times with seven finishes of second or third in his last nine events. Looking at the stats ranks here at Harbour Town over the last 24 rounds, Donald is the only player who ranks higher than Kuchar in DraftKings scoring and he also ranks 1st in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, 3rd in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, 6th in Strokes Gained: Around the Green, and 12th in Strokes Gained: Putting. With the terrible form, I would think twice before rostering him in cash games, but for GPP's it may be a good idea to get some exposure.
Donald  ->  positive

His record at the PGA is more spotty, but Johnson is simply playing too well to bypass, especially at the this price. Francesco Molinari - $6,800 (80-1)    As a member of the PGA Tour this season, the Italian has 12 top-25s in 17 starts and sits an impressive second in strokes gained approach, third in tee to green. Molinari is eighth in driving accuracy, and usually you have to be a real short hitter to rank so high.
Molinari  ->  positive

We're targeting ball strikers this week, and Glover ranks near the top in those categories this year and should be on your radar as a GPP play. -- Taras Pitra  Jason Kokrak  Not a guy who will garner a lot of attention coming into Harbourtown, but quietly he has made five consecutive cuts, including a Top 25 at The Genesis Open. I also like his tournament history, where he is riding three consecutive Top 20s with a sixth place here last year.
Jason Kokrak  ->  positive

Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)  FanDuel ($10,900)  Ranked even higher in my overall model(#1) is Paul Casey as he is the only player in the field who ranks Top 10 in all four categories on my sheet(stats, history, form & DK average last 5). It starts with the course history as Casey has now finished 6th or better in three straight Masters appearances and for his career has made eight of 11 cuts with five Top 10 finishes. Then comes the form which is spot on as he is coming off a huge win at the Valspar in his last stroke play event to extend his cuts made streak to 26 dating back to the Sony Open last year.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta. Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn’t exactly fit the “bomber” prototype that tends to succeed here: he’s 182nd in Driving Distance (286.6 yards), but he didn’t play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition’s averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance off the tee – he sits 16th in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes.
Moore  ->  positive

Might dabble in Bubba and/or Furyk if the price is right but I think Charl and Knox are fades for me. TUESDAY UPDATE: Was expecting a much higher salary for Furyk. I think at $7,200 on DraftKings, it’s easy to take a risk of relative poor form.
Furyk  ->  negative

He's finished top-25 here the last three years, and all that's gotten him is a $1,000 drop in price over last year. Holmes has horrendous GIR numbers this season, but he does rank a remarkable seventh in strokes gained putting. Kevin Streelman - $7,300 (80-1)  Streelman has top-20s here the past two years.
Holmes  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour. Get him in the first two rounds on FanDuel before his salary rises in future tournaments.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Justin Rose 20/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Rose has not played since the FedEx Cup play-offs so comes into this week fresh from a run of form that saw him finish inside the top-10 in each of the four FedEx Cup play-off events with a 2nd and three 10th place finishes. There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off. Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week.
Rose  ->  positive

Blaum has made the cut in all three events this season and finished no lower than 31st. As a bonus, Blaum finished 29th at Mayakoba a year ago, giving us a nice value his week  Zach Turcotte -- Charles Howell III ($7,500)  Following his 15th-place finish a week ago at The Shriners, it appears that CH III is back on board with being a solid cut-maker with upside. We are hoping to grab him this week at a little bit of a discount.
Blaum  ->  positive

He’s got all of the tools – including length – to take down an event like this one, and it should only be a matter of time before he does. Thorbjorn Olesen ($7,700) – Olesen hasn’t exactly been at the apex of his game lately, but he is an immensely talented player who clearly is trying to lock down his PGA Tour card this week with a big finish. While I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s a world-class player, he’s definitely a few cuts above his competition here at a very good bargain price.
Olesen  ->  positive

DJ had the one missed cut which brings that average just below Molinari's despite winning back to back events(not including Match Play). Molinari hasn't won but has been incredibly consistent with finishes of T22, T33, T7, T20 and T14 over his last five events and has made 10 of 11 cuts this season with three Top 10's and eight Top 25 finishes. He also fits the stats model very well(4th overall) with elite ranks in SG: APP(2nd), SG: APP+OTT(4th), Par 4 Scoring(9th), Par 5 Scoring(6th), BoB%(11th) and is not a bad scrambler either, ranking 25th in the field.
Molinari's  ->  positive

Other stats also look promising as Reavie has been gaining strokes approaching the green and putting once field adjusted. Ownership level will be an issue as you will have to decide what to do for GPP’s while in cash games Reavie is looking like an early lock. As always, this article is published as a first look, things change leading up to lock and SlackChat should be checked as thoughts are changed when new information arises.
Reavie  ->  positive

Byeong-hun An at 66/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - on the cusp of a US breakthrough and could come here  1pt e.w. Charl Schwartzel at 66/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - gone well here before; can easily ignore last week  0.5pt e.w. Robby Shelton at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - top-class talent in the making  Considering that host venue TPC Four Seasons is not perhaps among the more popular layouts on the circuit, another strong field has been secured for the AT&T Byron Nelson.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner ($10,400) will likely be the lowest-owned player among golfers with a salary of $10,000 or more, making him a great pivot play off guys like Rahm and Harman. Kisner has made the cut in his last 12 events, his 69.0 LT Adj Rd Score ranks fourth in this field, and he is tied for 10th with his 14.0 LT Adj Bird Avg. The Value Plays  One way to use FantasyLabs to find potential value golfers in our Models is to leverage our LT Adj Rd Score metric.
Kisner  ->  positive

He ranks fifth in SG off the tee, second in SGTTG, 16th in GIR and fourth in par 4 scoring. Rahm is turning into a superb player and he has the power and the game to be a serious contender here. Gary Woodland 45/1  The big hitting American is in great form coming to Mexico this week with four top 10’s and a top 20 in his last six events.
Rahm  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – St. Jude Classic  Lock of the week:  Francesco Molinari $10,500 – We’ve seen a mixed bag of winners here at TPC Southwind as there have been both accuracy guys and bombers that have prevailed to win this championship. However, Molinari can win on either for the results he has been producing lately. He’s consistently played well all year making 10/11 cuts with three T10s.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

As for iron play, Fowler sits a very healthy 7th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green while he's 12th in Approaches from over 200 yards. Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio. That's the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC, a long par 70 with testing par 4s, and Fowler has cracked the top 10 in his last three appearances there.
Fowler  ->  positive

It certainly did last year when he cracked the top 10 for the first time and beat his previous best of T14 (R1 64) on just his second appearance back in 2007. Casey is hovering around the top 10 again of late after T11 in the Honda Classic and T16 in the WGC-Mexico Championship on his last two outings. "I'm loving my golf more than I ever have," said the Englishman at January's CareerBuilder Challenge and the good vibes could definitely continue here.
Casey  ->  positive

Kevin Na ($8400): Na has a pretty sparkling course history here, with a T4 last year, T8 in 2012, and T9 in 2011 being his most recent successes (he missed the cut in 2014). Unfortunately, Na is not the same player he’s been in the past, and it’s shown this season with three straight missed cuts and only two top-10s in cut events. Na is struggling in some stats that show their importance this week, ranking a dismal 144th in GIR% and 65th in Birdie or Better percentage, but those stats have been inflated from playing the fall swing season events in weak fields on weak courses.
Na  ->  negative

Statswise he is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee and ranks 19th in SGTTG, second in SGP and seventh in par 4 scoring. Mickelson is brimming with confidence since winning in Mexico and has to be a big contender here this week. Luke List 25/1  List was a bit unlucky to break his putter last week in the first round of the WGC Matchplay.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Boosted Patrick Cantlay to 50/1 with Ladbrokes for WGC Mexico. Had worse prices in my time
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Chad Campbell ($7,700): Campbell will likely be popular this week but with current form that includes three top 15’s over his last five starts and course history that includes being 8/8 in cuts made at this event, he’s not someone I’d want to fade entirely. Campbell can struggle on the greens but his approach game is still top notch. He makes for an excellent cash game play this week.
Campbell  ->  positive

Vaughn Taylor ($6,300) – Has been playing well as of late, with a recent 15th at the Safeway Open, and has a 16th and a 25th in his two starts at this tourney. My main lineup in DraftKings this week as of right now, with $0 in the budget to spare: Russell Knox ($11,800), Si Woo Kim ($8,900), John Huh ($7,600), Charles Howell ($7,500), Shawn Stefani ($7,300), and Ryan Blaum ($6,900). Don’t yet have a daily fantasy sports account yet on FanDuel or DraftKings?
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

Selections    This is an extremely competitive and tricky heat and I've had to reign in my enthusiasm as I fancied quite a few. I like the look of Scott Piercy, Kevin Streelman and last year's runner-up, Patton Kizzire, to name but three, but I'm going to begin the tournament with just two serious selections - Jon Rahm and Jimmy Walker - and two outsiders for tiny stakes - Ryan Blaum and Ben Crane. Rahm's not a massive price at around [30.0] but if he kicks on this year it will look huge in the fullness of time because on all known evidence to date he looks like a future star and this course looks absolutely ideal for him.
Rahm  ->  positive

After a very slow start to the season, Johnson looks to have picked it up when it matters most, heading into the business-end of the season. In his last three starts he has finished 5th (John Deere Classic), 14th (Open Championship) and 2nd last week at the Bridgestone, so he has got it rolling once again. Johnson led the field in Strokes Gained: Putting last week at Firestone, which always bodes well heading into major week and if the rest of the game clicks this week, he could well get his third major victory and be just one step away (U.S. Open) from the Grand Slam.
Johnson  ->  positive

Final selections –  Brandt Snedeker 20/1 1pt EW  Phil Mickelson 20/1 0.5pts EW  Jon Rahm 22/1 0.5pts EW  Patrick Reed 33/1 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on social media –  Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/doublebogey6/  Twitter – www.twitter.com/doublebogeyDB6 Reed is a bit streaky lately but could be worth a risk here with his previous record.

Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler pictured in last year's renewal  Golf expert Ben Coley gives his take on Tiger Woods' chances at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, plus five each-way selections ranging from 20/1 to 250s. For those monitoring Tiger Woods closely, last week's runner-up finish at the Valspar Championship was either a case of perfect timing or premature something-or-other as he heads to Bay Hill in search of a remarkable ninth triumph in the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods had been quoted at 18/1 for this week's event by one firm prior to his effort in Tampa, but having contended throughout there the revised prices were understandably shorter when they arrived on Monday morning.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Praise indeed and as Patrick sits a trending 12th in my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker, I'm giving him a follow this week. RESULT: T9  Kevin Na 0.75pt EW 70/1 with New customers: get up to £25 in free bets via this link, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  With form of 6(TPC Boston)-29(Glen Oaks)-4(Sedgefield), Kevin Na is playing some nice stuff and for an each-way cover bet he's ideal this week. Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar ($7,500 | 50/1) - Kuchar's odds sit at 50/1 after being 66/1 on Friday afternoon. Kuchar has found some form at the Open in the past after being cut in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. He was 9th in 2012 and 15th in 2013 before sitting 54th, 58th, and 46th in the past three years.

His PPT drops to 74.92 — nearly 10 points below his average as a favorite — and his Plus/Minus dips by -0.64 points. That his Consistency drops 10 percentage points with lower salary-based expectations is something to remember when Spieth tees it up with lower odds to win — but that’s probably not something to concern yourself with for the Master: At the time of writing, Spieth has 12.5 percent odds to win, the second-highest odds in the stacked Masters field. Last year Spieth had 12.5 percent odds to win and finished with a +21.86 Plus/Minus in the tournament.
Spieth  ->  positive

Casey has been sniffing around the top 10 in every WGC event he's contested in the last two years and should be again this week at a decent price. Last 4 events: 49-8-9-11  Course form: 16  WGC form: 11-5-R16-16-12-16-51-7  Last 50 starts - Win: 0%, Top 5: 20%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  The two players who look to be absolutely striping it right now also happen to have made the top five here last year - Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood. The market knows this and Thomas looks a restrictive back price but I think the [2.64] for a Fleetwood top 10 is worth a play.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Dean & DeLuca Invitational - Final Round Stacy Revere  Now, I’m in a bit of a bind again with some of my choices. Both Johnson and Watson have been playing nowhere near their historical averages, yet the Model puts them in the ten picks. Well, I’ll just have to live with that.

Bill Haas,  ->  positive

Watching Phil over recent weeks I feel like I’ve been watching a loop of a tape where his putts keep hanging on the edge or burning the edges and if he can just get one or two more to drop this could at last be his week. PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price.
Patrick Cantlay.  ->  positive

Take away a weather induced Rd 2 80 at the Genesis Open and Hideki has been nothing but consistent this season while also showing the ability to win. Rickie Fowler – $9,500: A lot of people might say Rickie is not an ideal Rds 3-4 golfer but his Key Stats this week in the FGI PGA Model along with excellent Current Form I believe tell a different story. I won’t argue with anyone who wants to leave him off their Cash game roster but there’s ton of merit for him making it onto your GPP roster.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

He’s having one of the better years of his entire career, and this is an excellent price for a guy who is pretty unlikely to blow the cut line for you. VALUE  Andy Sullivan ($7,100) – Sullivan has generally been good-not-great in the US, but there’s little question that he is in the upper/elite tier of the European Tour conversation. He threw down a nasty 67 last week at the Scottish Open and has a history of playing resilient golf under tough conditions.
Sullivan  ->  positive

As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Softer conditions could favour bombers but in reality everyone is in play for the win here making this an intriguing venue for fantasy and betting purposes. Stud Picks  Bill Haas ($10,800): Haas has some tight competition at the top of the salary charts this week with Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson also playing decent golf, but Haas has been better than both recently. He recorded his best finish ever in a major at Erin Hills with a T5, and has four top 25 finishes now over his last four starts.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Chappell’s 60.3 LT Driving Accuracy percentage should help him navigate this tight course, and his respectable 12.1 LT Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament (Adj Bird Avg) certainly won’t hurt him. Chappell is 1-1 in his attempts at The Open: He finished T53 last year at Royal Troon. A Two-Time Major Champion  Speaking of good LT Adjusted Rd Scores, Martin Kaymer — a two-time major championship winner and former world’s No.
Chappell  ->  positive

However, it’s another PGA Tour maiden who catches my eye at a bigger price with Bud Cauley considered great value at 100/1. Cauley struck the ball really well on his way to a top-10 finish at the Heritage last week and the move to TPC San Antonio, where he’s twice played well in just three visits, may see him step up another level and contend. He’s done so several times lately, including when just in behind Garcia and Koepka at the Nelson last summer, and at 58th of over 200 players ranked for driving distance he gets it out there far enough from the tee.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Bonus  Pro Trends: 13, Adam Scott ($10,100)  Scott currently leads all players in the field with 13 Pro Trends, one of which is a Rec GIR of at least 75. Scott’s 29.9 PPR average through his last three events is atrocious, but it is only 0.1 PPR more than his LT average. He excels by being one of the best ball strikers in the game, and right now his Rec GIR of 78.2 percent shows that he has been getting it done recently.
Scott  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players as follows;  RORY SABBATINI – 25-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 43rd  This pick is purely about current form. I said after watching Sabbatini at the Valspar on Sunday a couple of weeks ago that I felt he would win soon and until he either does so, or his form dips, I want to keep him onside. Rory is the sort of player who can play well anywhere if he is on one of his rolls.
RORY SABBATINI  ->  positive

That being said he still finished with an impressive final round 67 to finish solo third. Noren has been playing some great golf over the last year or so with form figures 3,16,21,2,12,31,45,12 in his last eight tournaments. His form has been particularly impressive over the last four weeks and despite losing a playoff, he had a great week in Torrey Pines shooting rounds of 70,66,,69,73 and followed that with a T21 in Phoenix.
Noren  ->  positive

He is a safe play in all formats. Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Statswise he ranks second in SGP, fourth in SG Approaches to the green and fourth in scrambling, three stats that will stand him well here. Mickelson clearly loves Augusta and with his great current form and natural right to left shape, he could be a huge contender here. Paul Casey 22/1  Casey arrives to Augusta in great form and will be feeling particularly confident after winning at Copperhead a few weeks ago at the Valspar.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Simpson’s last four opening rounds on bermuda greens have been 67-67-69-66 and he opened with a 67 here last year. Simpson will be teeing off at 08:07 on Thursday morning so will therefore get the best of the greens, something he should hopefully relish given his current form with the putter. He may well find himself in the winners’ circle for the first time in years this season, but on this occasion all we need him to do is lead by the end of Thursday evening.
Simpson  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour. Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar.
Grillo  ->  positive

With all this in mind, here are my picks for the 2017 Players. Justin Rose 30/1 (Betfred 1/4 6 places) 1.5pts e/w:  A man who has plenty of starts here at TPC Sawgrass – Justin Rose would have been hoping for more than one top-5 and a measly two total top-20’s to his name. In 13 starts, his best finish here is a T4 in 2014, and his 19th last year was his next best finish, but I still think he has every chance of winning this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

RESULT: T70  Brian Stuard 1pt EW 100/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  We were on Brian Stuard last week at El Camaleon where he finished a single shot away from the extended each way places and I'm going to be patient with the Fort Worth, Texas-based 34 year-old who's playing phenomenal golf right now. A streaky scorer who clearly thrives on Bermudagrass and Paspalum putting surfaces, Stuard is also a strong coastal player.
Stuard  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($9700) – Another player coming off an interesting performance at the US Open, Casey has had success here his two times out – 2nd and T17 in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In 2015, Casey gained a massive 10 strokes to the field with the strength of his approach game, and that’s a repeatable skill that should help him this week. Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens.
Casey  ->  positive

With all this in mind, here are my selections for the 2017 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time.
Mickelson  ->  positive

So it's hard not to like Rickie this week on a coastal course where wind will undoubtedly be a large factor. 2 visits have generated a 6th (2013) and 5th (2016) and it's true that Fowler has never arrived on Maui with such total confidence in his putter. Whilst Spieth, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have question marks against them in my mind with recent performances, Fowler seems at the peak of his powers and his record after winning is also an interesting angle.
Fowler  ->  positive

Ryan Moore came within a missed shortish range putt of winning this 12 months at 50/1 - he ranked 14th in the FEC. Kevin Chappell was 15th and also made the Playoff 12 months ago and this trend runs through to the likes of Danny Lee (19th), Justin Rose (12th), Jordan Spieth (13th), Luke Donald (15th), K.J. Choi (13th) and Jim Furyk (11th) since 2010.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Outright Bets to Win  Brian Harman 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  JJ Spaun 65/1  First Round Leader  Jon Rahm 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chez Reavie 50/1  Brian Stuard 75/1  Sam Saunders 120/1  Doubles  Jon Rahm 8/1  Brian Harman 15/1  Kevin Kisner 20/1  Patton Kizzire 30/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  Euro  Dustin Johnson 5/1  Rory Mcilroy 7/1  Justin Rose 8/1  Branden Grace 22/1  Tommy Fleetwood 40/1 We'll touch on those at the end. We'll just get right to it with the first tip, the La Quinta Course is the Easiest of the 3 so we should target guys that tee off early on this course first on Thurs for the First Round Leader bets.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

All in all though he’s not for me at the price, and I shall continue to watch his progress as a fascinated bystander. So on to this week’s picks and it’s five for me as follows;  JUSTIN ROSE – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 3rd  I shall say straight of the bat that I’m not really looking to reinvent the wheel with my picks this week and first up for me is Justin Rose. The case for Rose is a pretty obvious one this week and one thing Tiger’s presence at the top of the market does do is create a more than fair e/w price for the Englishman.
JUSTIN ROSE  ->  positive

Studs  *In order of my rankings  Jordan Spieth ($11,400)  Spieth sputtered a bit last week at the U.S. Open but came storming back Sunday with a 69 in difficult conditions. Surprisingly, Spieth’s ball-striking was solid, but it was his trusty putter that let him down at Erin Hills. That’s a good sign moving forward because we know he’ll regain his touch on the greens.
Spieth  ->  positive

Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks. He is third in the field in SG:APP, seventh in SG:ATG, sixth in Par 4 Scoring, fourth in Bogey Avoidance, ninth in Scrambling and first in Birdie or Better %.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Both have the expected ties to this event – Peterson was T8 on an invite in 2013, while Loupe made his PGA Tour debut here (note: Kevin Chappell’s pro PGA Tour debut came in the Texas Open, which he won last week). Local ties have revealed themselves in previous editions, which makes sense as this is the only PGA Tour stop in Louisiana, and the fact that Loupe was 11th in birdie average last season tells you plenty about his game. If – and it’s an almighty if – he turns up in the form which saw him share 10th two starts back, he could propel the partnership into contention at a huge 250/1.
Loupe  ->  positive

TYLER DUNCAN – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  I mentioned earlier in the preview that this event has graced the Web.com tour for the past two seasons and Duncan is one player who has tee’d it up in both renewals. In those two outings Duncan has finished 33rd in 2016 and 3rd in 2017 and in eight rounds on the course his worst performance is 70. Clearly therefore Tyler has enjoyed his time in the Dominican Republic.
TYLER DUNCAN  ->  positive

In his four starts on Bermuda greens so far this season, Johnson has ranked 33rd, 40th, 65th and 29th in SG: Putting and whilst it is encouraging that his best effort came last week, there is clearly scope for improvement. Should he find something on the greens this week, that he has struggled to so far this season, Johnson could well be in contention come Sunday. Despite his struggles on the green, Johnson does still rank 30th in Par 5 Scoring Average this season, and that will help him here.
Johnson  ->  positive

He comes in 12th overall in my model this week due to his lower ranks in Par 4 Scoring(64th) and BoB%(47th) but ranks 13th in SG: OTT + APP which really draws my attention this week. Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Both though need to show form and fast. That's not really a thought right now for Berger who at 30th in the FEC standings still has to perform well simply to qualify for the Tour Championship. He will draw masses from 12 months ago where, as a rookie, he performed magnificently at the BMW Championship finishing 2nd to Jason Day.
Berger  ->  positive

I've laid out my argument for Ross Fisher in this week's each-way column here and I'm following Paul Krishnamurty in with Alex Levy at a triple-figure price. Selections:  Martin Kaymer [44.0]  Ross Fisher @ [80.0]  Alex levy @ [100.0]    I'll be back later with my Sanderson Farms Championship preview later today. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter  https://twitter.com/SteveThePunter
Ross Fisher  ->  positive

In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory. Harman would join Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Mike Weir as left-handed players to have won here since the turn of the century.
Harman  ->  positive

1pt each-way Matthew Fitzpatrick at 35/1 with Betfred He’s won big tournaments before including the British Masters and DP World Tour Championship and competing for WGCs and majors is the next logical step on his career. Ranked inside the top-40 in the world now is the opportunity for him to make the breakthrough at a world level.
Matthew Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Marc Leishman has been in great form of late and deserves consideration, as does Kevin Kisner, who gained over four strokes on the greens the last time he played here. Value targets include Russell Henley (T3 here in 2015), Bryson DeChambeau and Si Woo Kim, who played through injury last year but enters 2018 seemingly healthy and coming off a T3 finish in his second last start. My Pick: Rickie Fowler ($10,500)  Fowler ended 2018 in perhaps the best form of anyone, landing a win at the Hero Open (where he closed with a 61) and a T2 in his second-to-last start in Mexico.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

Branden Grace withdrawing after the first round definitely beat up a number of otherwise promising cash lines as well. Poor Sunday performances by Kisner (77), CH3 (74), and RCB (74) further dinged our cash hopes, but fortunately a huge performance by the constantly underrated Gary Woodland along with solid showings by Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Brendan Steele, and a few of our hedge plays buoyed a number of subscribers to a positive ROI, including myself. I’d also like to extend a special congratulations for Scott P. on a pretty sizable GPP hit this week as well – nice work buddy!
Brendan Steele,  ->  positive

After an impressive 61 in the final round last week at the Sony, Reavie will be feeling confident here and could have a good chance. Final selections –  Bill Haas 1pt EW 20/1  Jamie Lovemark 0.5 pts EW 33/1  Luke List 0.5 pts EW 50/1  Chez Reavie 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 5pts  Paddypower paying seven places! Good luck and enjoy the golf.
Reavie  ->  positive

It will be interesting to see how Lingmerth responds after leading the first three rounds last week, only to falter in Sunday’s final round. Lingmerth has finished no worse than 16th here at the Old White, with two top-10 finishes in three starts. And despite not closing out the win last week, Lingmerth has been hot lately: He is tied for third in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

He is a player who looks to be finding form of old and worth keeping an eye on. Stuard on the other hand continued to do what he has done all season long – he impressed. Stuard’s T4 finish at the Sony this past weekend was his second top-4 and third top-10 in his first five starts this season, whilst also going 5/5 for cuts made.
Stuard  ->  positive

In my mind he's ready for his 5th PGA Tour victory. RESULT: MC  Jhonattan Vegas 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Let's be frank you never really know what you are going to get from Jhonattan Vegas but he's undoubtedly turned a corner over the last 20 months and he currently sits at 39th in the OWGR.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Also Consider: Ollie Schniderjans, Russell Henley, Tommy Fleetwood, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Webb Simpson, Beyong–Hun An, Charles Howell (14/16 here, and has now made ten straight cuts, great value at only $6,900), Anirban Lahiri, and Billy Horschel. Regardless of what his ownership level ends up being (13-16% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs), Kaymer is an absolute steal at $7,400, and is a strong play in both cash games and GPPs. He has only played here at Bayhill once, missing the cut back 2008, but this was a long time ago, and Kaymer is a world class player who is in great current form.
Billy Horschel.  ->  positive

Using the Strokes Gained stats, he was ranked 1st in SG: Approach-The-Green last week, gaining 8.652 shots on the field." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 8 places    Main Bet: Back Jordan Spieth e.w. @ 10/1  To be honest, I've spent most of the Masters build-up looking for one decisive sign.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town. He is a safe cash game play but does not provide much upside in tournaments.
Molinari  ->  positive

You really need to do everything well to score around here," he said two years ago so finishing second (BMW) and fourth (Dell Technologies) on the All-Around in the last two FedEx Cup Playoff events shows his game is in ideal shape to make an impression. Those two second places at East Lake add to a pair of runners-up finishes at nearby Augusta National so playing Rose 'without Spieth' makes extra sense given that he's been the nearly man so many times in Georgia. It's stating the obvious to say that Spieth would out-putt him if the two were locked together coming down the stretch so I'm convinced this is the best market for Rose this week.
Rose  ->  positive

He also finished 2nd in tee to green at Honda Classic. Checking the box in multiple categories and playing back in Florida, Billy Ho is our other dark horse this week. Others to consider: CT Pan, Steve Stricker  Chalk to Fade  Matt Kuchar ($10,400) – Yes, Kuchar provides you that “safety” you want in a cash game play.
Billy  ->  positive

He fell beck over the weekend shooting rounds of 72 and 78 but really looked to be hitting the ball really well and putting beautifully. Hoffman has a good record here finishing T8 in 2012, T6 in 2013 and T14 last year. If Charley can regain some of last week’s confidence from rounds one and two he could go very well here.
Hoffman  ->  positive

If he’s motivated, Spieth is my pick to win. Looking at my recent strokes gained model, Spieth ranks seventh. Justin Thomas ($10,200)  Thomas shot a record-setting 63 on Saturday at the U.S. Open, but just didn’t have his best on Sunday.
Spieth  ->  positive

With four par 5s on hand this week, I like the Georgia Bulldog who has seven eagles in his last 10 starts. Aaron Wise ($8,100): The Oregon standout is generally lights out with his long irons which should be key this week. He's a West Coast guy but these overseeded greens don't require a steep learning curve.
Aaron Wise  ->  positive

3rd at the CIMB Classic and 2nd in the KJ Choi Invitational both in October shouts value to me and there are other strong points I really like this week. 50th in Birdie Average and 18th in Putting from 5-15 feet in the embryonic PGA Tour statistics tell a story and Kang's record at El Camaleon specifically and in Mexico in general is interesting. Opening rounds of 67-67 placed Kang in 2nd place here after 36 holes on course debut way back in 2011 and he was still 6th going into the final round.
Kang's  ->  positive

Zach Johnson has won this twice, while Bud Cauley has current form of 5-5-10-9. I can't quite settle on any though so I'll jump all the way down to 80/1 (was 100s, grrrrrr) and have a punt on Sean O'Hair. He shot 67-69-68-68 to finish T5 in last week's AT&T Byron Nelson Championship so arrives full of confidence and his stats were particularly relevant to this week.
Sean O'Hair.  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Chappell  ->  positive

He doesn't play a lot, with only 13 starts all season, but he's accrued five top-25s. Jones has missed only one cut since March and is coming off a T18 in his last start at Memphis. Always considered a good putter, his numbers there are down this year (70th in SG: Putting), but he's 11th in scrambling, 62nd in SG: Tee-to-Green and 55th in SG: Total.
Jones  ->  positive

Mix in his recent hot irons and always solid short game (first in the field ATG over the last 12 rounds), and you just need his putter to show up. And unlike many of my picks this week, Hadwin actually is an excellent putter, especially on poa greens. He uncharacteristically has dropped strokes putting in his last three starts, but he gains over 2.5 strokes, on average, on poa greens per event in his career.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $10000 – Coming off a tie for second at Colonial last week, Spieth is back in form and will take a liking to putting the quick greens at Muirfield. His scrambling percentage has been subpar this season to date, but with an elite iron game and putting that turned the corner last week, look for Spieth to shine in Ohio. Matt Kuchar, $9500 – If there’s a horse for the course this week, it’s Kuchar, who has notched six career top-10s in 11 starts at Muirfield, including a win in 2013.
Spieth,  ->  positive

RESULT: T44  I'll also have a dabble with a couple of longer shots at a tournament where we know crazy winners can and do happen:  Ryan Palmer 0.5pt EW 150/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Texan Ryan Palmer loves a home game and despite a very poor period of play he ranks 7th in this week's Published Predictor Model. Palmer, who co-led at PGA National after 36 holes last time out, loves to play in his home state: top 5s and top 10s abound for Ryan across TPC San Antonio, TPC Four Seasons and his home course of Colonial. Statistically Palmer sits 9th in Going for the Green and 48th in Proximity from 150 to 175 yards, which are 2 key statistics for the GC of Houston.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

This week, several golfers with great LT Adj Rd Scores and low salaries are available: Stewart Cink (who looks like the value chalk play this week), Chad Campbell, and Luke List. Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips.
Campbell,  ->  positive

Back JJ Henry 1u @ [1000.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [50.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [15.0]  Back JJ Henry for a Top 20 Finish 1.5u @ [8.0]    If Si Woo Kim can win the Fifth Major from the maximum odds of [1000.0], so too can this Texan course specialist! You have to go back a few years but Henry has plenty of course form, with third place in 2012 the best of four top-13 finishes. The 42-year-old has always been the type to pop up in serious contention every so often at enormous odds.
Henry  ->  positive

Advanced statistics support Streelman’s case too ranking him in the Top 10 in value this week. Julian Suri ($7,600) – Julian Suri mainly plays on the European Tour, but he’s shown lately that he can certainly hack it over here. More specifically, he can hack it in Texas.
Julian Suri  ->  positive

I love him to compete for the W this weekend. Daniel Berger ($8,900)- Coming off a 7 th place finish at the WMO, Berger, comes to PGA National where he has found success in the past placing second in 2015. He also missed the cut last year, so buyer beware, but still, I like his upside.
Berger  ->  positive

Other: Adam Scott, Tommy Fleetwood, Graeme McDowell  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama, Paul Casey, Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, Jason Dufner, Martin Kaymer, Zach Johnson, Branden Grace  – Ryan Palmer, Russell Henley, Ian Poulter, Bubba Watson, Adam Scott, Tommy Fleetwood, Graeme McDowell, Kevin Kisner, Molinari  Main Bets:  Jordan Spieth 16-1 (opened at 14-1)  Paul Casey 45-1 ew  Jason Dufner 80-1 ew  Russell Henley 80-1 ew  Graeme McDowell 140-1 ew With his playing privileges reinstated for the year, I think a free-swinging Poulter could surprise here and at only $6,600 he’s a perfect stars and scrubs play. He’s also made nine of 11 cuts at this event and has a runner-up finish here too from back in 2009.
Graeme McDowell  ->  positive

You could make a case Hoffman should be the favorite this week, so these bigger than expected odds make him a must play. Billy Horschel - Billy Horschel hasn’t looked sharp since the Arnold Palmer, but he still has four top-25 finishes and was tied for fourth at the Honda Classic. Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average.
Horschel  ->  positive

Zach Johnson should go well after another promising effort last week  Johnson remains an above-average putter, but it's a while since he's been a deadly one and combined with the fact that he cannot overpower any golf course, that explains why too often he's been on the fringes of contention without adding to his impressive haul of 12 PGA Tour wins. Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark.
Johnson  ->  positive

I don't care what stats or data you show me, I'm never paying $8,700 for McGirt when Justin Thomas is $8,600. Take my money.
McGirt  ->  negative

He is second on the European Tour in GIR and he's even 18th in putting, the weakest part of his game. Tier 2 Values    Justin Rose - $9,600 (20-1)    Rose has three top-4s in four starts this year, including tournaments played at Torrey Pines and Riviera. He's a horrid 164th in driving accuracy, but still is fifth in strokes gained tee-to-green.
Rose  ->  positive

We like him as the sneaky play. Fade: Jason Day. Very few signs of life lately and tough to forget the opening-round 79 at the U.S. Open last month.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Considering the confidence he is entering with, seeing Fowler figure out the Plantation greens this year wouldn’t be shocking, and his course history suggests that even a slight improvement in this area could mean a win in the first event of 2018. My Sleeper: Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000)  DeChambeau will be making his first appearance at this event after winning the John Deere Classic late in the 2017 season. Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts.
Bryson  ->  positive

He started strongly with a T13 at the Safeway Open back in October and followed that with a T17 at the CIMB Classic, T15 at the CJ Cup, T24 at the WGC-HSBC Champions, T14 at the OHL Classic and T18 at the Sony Open in Hawaii in January. Reavie has been playing particularly well over the last couple of weeks with back to back seconds. He came close to victory in Phoenix getting himself into a playoff with Gary Woodland after shooting an impressive final round 66 but lost the sudden death playoff to a par on the tricky 18th.
Reavie  ->  positive

Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
Sergio Garcia  ->  negative

He still carded yet another top-ten finish, so disregard him at your own peril. Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout.
Jon Rahm:  ->  positive

I’ve written before about what’s already been an up-and-down career for a player who took a Spieth-like route to the PGA Tour before Spieth himself, so I’ll give you the abridged version this time. Essentially, Cauley looked to have the world at his feet and went close on a number of occasions straight out of college, but injuries and a loss of confidence then seriously hampered what promised to be an exceptional career. However, a Web.com Tour win a couple of years ago signalled a return to where he belongs and Cauley went close in last year’s Byron Nelson before threatening to win again at the start of this year, eventually finishing third in the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Cauley  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card. When he is on, he hits greens as well as anyone on tour.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

Going Against the Grain  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Off The Tee  Par 5 Birdie or Better  It’s hard to fit Daniel Berger ($11,300) into either of these categories because he does so many things well on the golf course. To be fair, Berger is a volatile golfer with a runner-up finish, missed cut and a victory in his last three starts. Berger’s stat line for 2017 is as impressive as they come though, as you can see below.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

A brilliant and unlucky runner-up at Augusta, the Englishman is 4th on the All-Around in 2017 and 16th for GIR. Henrik Stenson  It’s well documented that Stenson is best played in the final two majors of the season. Evidence?
Stenson  ->  negative

What you read next is a little bit of evidence with a mixture of good and bad luck, so take it for what it's worth. En route to my league title in 2015-16, I reserved Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth for the first, third and fourth events of the Playoffs, respectively, and still won despite a T31, T42 and T17 from those cornerstone investments. (Emiliano Grillo's T33 at TPC Boston didn't help much, either.)
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off. Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week. Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event.
Rose  ->  positive

So if the 24 year-old starts the New Year in exactly the same vein as 2016, it will undoubtedly be hard for the other single-digit priced contenders, namely Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson or a rusty Jason Day, to stay in his slipstream. RESULT: 2nd  Brandt Snedeker 2pts EW 20/1 with  Brandt Snedeker loves Hawaii so much that he arrived on Maui on Boxing Day and as we know he absolutely thrives when it comes to both coastal golf and the West Coast swing. Buoyed by delivering a fantastic 3 points from 3 matches at the Ryder Cup, Sneds travelled directly to Fiji and won the co-sanctioned European Tour event with ease in tough, windy conditions he excels in.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’.
Casey  ->  positive

From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore. 2nd at Quail Hollow to Rory McIlroy at the classical Quail Hollow in 2015 stands out, as does 6th at Silverado in 2015 and 4th at Torrey Pines this season from a classical tree-lined perspective.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights. A good start to the season, and a return to the course that literally saved his career, there is a good chance we see a buoyant Vaughn Taylor this week, as he looks to build on his efforts in Phoenix last week.
Taylor  ->  positive

The left-hander was a big eye-catcher in Boston, where the long game and the short game worked in harmony for sixth place - his best strokeplay finish since last year's second place at the Open Championship. Mickelson spoke afterwards of some real off-course struggles this year, including severe fatigue, but says he's on the right track now and relieved to finally get rewarded for his hard work. Statistically, Mickelson was really close to his absolute best last time and despite a stop-start season, he yet again ranks inside the PGA Tour's top 20 in birdie average.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Chris Kirk ($9,100) – Kirk has missed back-to-back cuts on tough tracks, and now comes to an easy course in a weak field. This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one. I have a slight concern with Kirk in that he’s never played here before, but raw talent should get him into contention this week.
Kirk  ->  positive

Michael Thompson  3. Billy Horschel  MY PICK : Xander Schauffele ($8,800)  Schauffele comes into this week’s event playing solid golf, but still looking for his first top-five finish of 2018. The 2017 Rookie of the Year has made his last four cuts in stroke play and will be making his second appearance at this venue after missing the cut last season.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Top 5 Finishes So Far This Season  1st – Aaron Wise – $8,800 – Byron Nelson – Week 20  1st – Jason Day – $9,400 – Farmers Insurance – Week 4  1st – Bubba Watson – $8,200 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  2nd – Patrick Reed – $7,700 – Valspar Championship – Week 10  2nd – Chez Reavie – $8,000 – AT&T – Week 6  2nd – Adrian Otaugui – $7,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Lucas Herbert – $7,100 – Rocco Forte Open – Week 19  3rd – Brandon Steele – $7,800 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  3rd – Alex Noren – $8,700 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  3rd – Jorge Campillo – $8,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Emiliano Grillo – $8,600 – Fort Worth Invitational – Week 21  4th – Seungsu Han – $7500 – Oman Open – Week 7  5th – Chris Paisley – $7,400 – Dubai Desert Classic – Week 4  5th – Phil Mickelson – $8,700 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  5th – Seungsu Han – $8,500 – Corales Puntacana Championship – Week 12  5th – Webb Simpson – $9,400 – RBC Heritage – Week 15  5th – Jorge Campillo – $8,500 – Espana De Open – Week 15  5th – Phil Mickelson – $9,200 – Wells Fargo – Week 18  Euro Tour Picks sponsored by Golf Predictor – for all your DFS stats for both the European & US PGA Tours.

Noren  ->  positive

Brian Harman  3. Kevin Kisner  MY PICK : Bud Cauley ($8,000)  Cauley has accumulated four top-10 finishes in his last five starts and has quickly become a proven commodity for fantasy. While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish.
Cauley  ->  positive

Daniel Berger is tournament favourite and might be a dual winner already in 2017 but for Spieth performing his party trick again from a bunker at the Travelers Championship last month. Kevin Kisner and Kyle Stanley are also recent winners who figure prominently but I am going to delve a little deeper and go for Hilton Head hero Wesley Bryan, who is quite an attractive 80/1 chance. It was a pretty tense old finish at the RBC Heritage but Bryan displayed plenty of bottle over the closing holes to pip course specialist Luke Donald by a shot and get off the mark on the PGA Tour.
Wesley Bryan,  ->  positive

As highlighted in the preview, I'm going to be concentrating on the leaders from very early on and if Rose, a notoriously slow starter, begins well, I'll be looking to get him onside but he looks a risky play before the off and he makes little appeal in this very competitive market. Rose's closest rival here is Paul Casey and he has just the right all-round game to make an impression in a US Open but his pedigree isn't great. His tied 10th at Oakmont ten years ago is his best effort and Rose backers may have more to fear from young guns, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Tyrrell Hatton.
Rose,  ->  positive

Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
Oosthuizen  ->  negative

His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour.
Stewart Cink  ->  negative

More relevant here are his strong birdie average stats (31st last season) and wealth of experience in Asia, where he cut his teeth as a professional, while his seventh in the Wyndham and back-to-form 12th in the BMW Championship suggest that the CIMB Classic comes just at the right time. There has been an Australian in the frame in each of the four renewals here at TPC Kuala Lumpur and Smith looks well-equipped to at least match his own effort three years ago. Recommended bets: CIMB Classic  1pt e.w.
Smith  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for The Northern Trust. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Dustin Johnson ($10,800)  DJ hasn’t been in the best for this summer, but he played well enough in the last two majors to intrigue me. After injuring his back and missing the Masters, it’s been a tough road back to the top, but DJ is close.
DJ  ->  positive

The veteran has yet to win this season, but the consistency he’s shown and his improved play in the bigger events means he warrants consideration as a sub-7k target. Haas also ranks sixth in efficiency on par 4’s from 450-500 yards and is also top-ten in bogey avoidance for the year, making him well-suited for a venue which played as the seventh toughest on tour last season. He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS.
Haas  ->  positive

This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
Rahm’s  ->  negative

Also giving him confidence will be the fact he comes into this event as a PGA Tour winner for the first time. Berger won the 2016 FedEx St.Jude Classic, beating Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Steve Stricker by 3 strokes. The St.Jude Classic is played at TPC Southwind, another short (7,244 yards) Par 70 course.
Berger  ->  positive

Koepka was runner-up here last season and has averaged 82.8 DK points over his last three starts; he’s also only $10,200. Other high floor/value targets include Matt Kuchar ($8,700), Russell Henley ($8,300), Ryan Moore ($7,600) and Sung Kang ($7,400). Tournaments: My favorite likely lower-owned play among the top players this week is Jordan Spieth ($10,800).
Russell Henley  ->  positive

If you are playing the Yahoo format or even the PGA fantasy league than you are severely limited on starts. It does no good to name Dustin Johnson or Jordan Spieth every week. I will make sure my picks as low as possible and spread the field out to introduce new names.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

His putting can be tilting at times but his ballstriking should help limit blowup holes. In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats.
Molinari  ->  positive

Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix. Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights.
Taylor  ->  positive

Lovemark has only played this event once (last year – T52) but the lack of experience is made up for by his recent form and bargain pricing this week. Even though we haven’t seen his best golf for a while, Lovemark is still ranked 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and has accumulated seven top-10s in the past year and a half on tour. With this sort of pedigree, and a game possibly on the upswing, this is a great time to buy low on Lovemark, as he has plenty of upside for the price we are getting this week on DraftKings.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should. It’s not a bad price, but the likely ownership, less than stellar form and lack of success at Riviera leads us to fade him completely.
Tony  ->  negative

Bradley was first for greens in regulation at the Travelers so his irons were dialled in while he was third on the All-Around so did everything well. If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there.
Bradley's  ->  positive

The current World No.39 has had an excellent 2017 and is another who should have taken plenty of positives away from his US Open performance. Hoffman finished eight there and his closing 1-under 71 included a triple-bogey 7 so could have been higher. He's since followed that up with T3 at the Travelers Championship where he shot all four rounds in the 60s.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Adam Scott: Scott hasn’t played here since 2014, when he finished fourth. Scott’s 70.7 LT GIR percentage is fourth, and his 15.0 LT Adj Bird Avg is eighth. Scott has two top-10 finishes in his last three tournaments, and he is tied for seventh with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score.
Scott:  ->  positive

While he has just one finish inside the top 10 at Augusta National, T11 and T12 in the last three years back up the idea that he'll always give you a run for your money in these markets on this course. Last four events: 43-14-37-MC  Course form: 11-MC-12-5-38-27-38  Last 10 majors: 5-22-5-11-33-46-MC-MC-30-30  Last 50 starts - Win: 2%, Top 5: 22%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  I couldn't quite pull the trigger on Justin Rose in the outright market but I have no hesitation making him my best top 10 punt here. Rose has the most robust greens in regulation stats at Augusta National of any player in the field this week and that will get you the top 10s.
Rose  ->  positive

8. Rickie Fowler, United States -- Not only did Rickie squander a chance to win The Barclays by fading down the stretch to tie for seventh, he played himself out of an automatic spot on the United States Ryder Cup team. Now he has until Sept. 12 to convince Davis Love to make him one of four captain's picks and he can start this week when he defends his title in the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011. Jim is in great form and while he is a slow starter should fare just fine here as his average finish position is 30th.
Jim  ->  positive

He will force DraftKings players into an interesting decision though, as $13,000 is a steep price to pay. Luke List has been at or near the top of ownership levels in his last few events and he hasn’t really paid off. In addition to distance, Par 5 Scoring is always an important stat to target on a long par 72 course like Eagle Point.
Luke List  ->  positive

However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark. In 14 starts here, he's backed five top-10 finishes, missing the cut only once, and it was encouraging to see a return to bermuda provoke an improved putting display when he finished 14th at the Valspar Championship last week.
Johnson  ->  positive

He has some startling history at the Honda Classic having posted a ludicrous 61 in the second round in 2012, a course record which helped him finish tied 12th. Harman went low again with a closing 64 in 2015 for T11 and he was also T11 at halfway last year before fading on the weekend. "The course definitely fits my eye for whatever reason.
Harman  ->  positive

For all the imponderables this event presents, what previous renewals tell us is that those ranking inside the top five in greens will have outstanding chances to win if they can manage their mistakes. On the strength of his first two visits, his improvement since the second of them, and his form all year, Thomas is firmly expected to be one of those five. Another point which could be significant is how diligent Thomas has been in his homework.
Thomas  ->  positive

When we go against the grain, we’ll be targeting distance, long par 5 scoring, and scrambling. Going With The Grain  Driving Accuracy  Strokes Gained: Approach  Greens in Regulation  Par 3 Birdie or Better  Jordan Spieth ($12,000) and Matt Kuchar ($9,300) will forever be linked thanks to Sunday of The Open Championship this year. It’s hard to argue against Spieth from a recent form standpoint, with two victories in his last two starts.
Spieth  ->  positive

A $200,000 increase in his salary seems light and Sean was 28th here 12 months ago and in the top 10 at TPC Summerlin on his last visit to the desert. Adam Hadwin ($7.5m) suits PGA West. I wished he had played in Hawaii, but the Canadian fits this tournament perfectly from a statistics angle and he went out in the final group with Dufner and Lovemark here 12 months ago, finishing 6th.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Bryan  ->  positive

He’s not a scoring golfer which can hurt him on a track with as many birdies as this course sees, but he avoids big numbers and excels at putting the ball in the best possible spots – he ranks 37th in both Par-3 Scoring as well as Par-4 Scoring, but is hurt on par-5s by a lack of distance. Blair is another excellent Bermuda putter (0.869 SG:P) and he does have the ability to go low as shown by his -12 and -10 performances at the Barbasol and Houston Open. Blair makes a fine play paired with an expensive Kevin Kisner, because he may not finish first but he will stay in contention and should be in line for a top-30 finish.
Blair  ->  positive

Spieth/Norlander/Phil/Simpson  ->  positive

Bermuda only serves to enhance his advantage around the greens, as "a good ol' southern boy" who grew up playing on them, and he rates the biggest threat to the front two by some margin in my book. Leishman and Harman have superseded him only because of what happened last week and given the contrast in courses, plus the fact that 17th was a perfectly fair effort from Kisner, I'd prefer to focus on all the other evidence which points towards our man. Third at the TOUR Championship last September and fourth in his only subsequent start of 2017, there's every chance Kisner is up there throughout this week and he's worthy of a decent each-way bet.
Kisner,  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan is never going to out-drive Dustin Johnson. 2018 Masters Picks — Targets From Each Range  I’ll play the history over recent form and take Spieth as my Masters champion. He has never finished worse than 11th in four career Augusta starts, with a win and two silver medals to his credit.
Spieth  ->  positive

The question is always, will the putter stay hot. If it does this week, Steele could easily take on this loaded field and come out with the big check. James Hahn $7,100 – To say, “Hahn enjoys the West Coast swing,” may be the understatement of the year.
Steele  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

It doesn’t hurt that Rahm recently won the Farmers Insurance Open on a course with Kikuyu grass in the fairways and rough and Poa annua greens like the ones at Chapultepec this week. Sergio Garcia ($8,500): Garcia has been very good at the elevation of Crans-sur Sierre: He won the event in 2005 and has finished third, fourth, and sixth in five starts at that track. Garcia’s 67.8 Recent Adj Rd Score is tied for fourth, his 72.6 percent Recent GIR is 15th, and his 16.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for 11th in this week’s field.
Garcia  ->  positive

Sneds has been an ever present at Augusta since 2010 and he will be arguably therefore the most motivated man in the field in Houston this week to get the win to ensure this streak remains intact, and for that reason alone I am happy to roll the dice with him this week. BUD CAULEY – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finished 18th  Like List another player who has been knocking on the door of a maiden PGA tour win for a few years now is Bud Cauley. It’s hard to believe that the Florida native burst on to the scene as long ago as 2011 when he had two top 5 finishes in seven starts on the PGA tour.
BUD CAULEY  ->  positive

Casey then tee’d it up at the CJ Cup finishing T19 and followed that with a T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions, T8 in Pebble and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship where he shot three rounds of 68 or better. Casey then went to Copperhead where he shot a final round 69 to post 10 under in total, one clear of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed. His form at Augusta is excellent with four top 10’s in nine appearances, three of which have been the last three years in a row (6,4,6).
Casey  ->  positive

He is seeking his first career win and very well could be in contention this week but it is not needed for him to hit value in DFS as he sits comfortably in the mid $8K range. Top Current Form Targets  Brian Harman  World Golf Ranking (#20)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,500)  FanDuel ($11,600)    His price has reached a new high($7,388 season average in 2017) but for good reason as he has been money this season. It started in the fall swing where he finished T5 at the CJ Cup, 8th at the WGC-HSBC Champions, and T4 at the RSM Classic.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Players I will have no share of. Emiliano Grillo – $9,000  He is becoming a staple near the top of the leaderboard, but I do not see myself owning Grillo this week. For one, I like so many of the other golfers around Grillo, and find myself gravitating towards them.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  negative

However, if Uihlein is going to pick up a PGA Tour win in the 2017-2018 season, the fall swing season seems like an ideal time to get the job done. Ollie Schniederjans – $8,300  Similar to Uihlein, Ollie Schniederjans has to be one of the favourites to pick up his first career win in the fall swing series. Ollie had a great 2017 season, although it didn’t end quite as well as he had hoped.
Uihlein  ->  positive

The Ontario native is enjoying a fantastic rookie season, continuing to pile up FedEx Cup points well after his surprise win at the RSM Classic in November. Hughes has seven other top-25s, including two of his past three starts, and if the Tour Championship started today, he'd be in it, sitting 26th in points. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
Hughes  ->  positive

Waialae this week is a flat course with tiny greens and tough Bermuda grass rough. It plays right into Spieth's hands, which are magical around the greens. Jeff Bergerson: Daniel Berger ($8,800)  We have our first full-field, cut event, which means we need to place a premium on guys who can make the cut and give us four full rounds of accumulating points.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Noren comes here in much better form this time around and could be a huge danger man here. Thomas Pieters 35/1  The big hitting Belgian is playing some decent golf lately and after a great performance here last year, Chapultepec looks like it could really suit his game. Pieters has had a mixed bag of form over the last few months but there has been some decent stand out performances.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

Opening rounds of 67-67 placed Kang in 2nd place here after 36 holes on course debut way back in 2011 and he was still 6th going into the final round. In 14 El Camaleon rounds Sung-hoon has shot in the 60s 9 times and you just get the feeling that Kang is a far more confident player these days. He also finished 6th in the 2015 web.com Mexico Championship so clearly gets on with the country and, if we want more coastal links, his amazing round of 60 at Spyglass Hill in the 2016 AT&T Pebble Beach Invitational should be taken into account.
Kang  ->  positive

The FedEx Cup itself has been won by the Tour Championship tournament winner here every time since 2010. Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Billy Horschel, Henrik Stenson and Brandt Snedeker were all in the top 6 of the FEC standings across the last 5 renewals whilst Bill Haas and Jim Furyk were in positions 25 and 11 respectively in the 2 years prior to that. 12 months ago, Rory McIlroy was he first FEC winner since Bill Haas to not control his own destiny when arriving in Atlanta.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here. "There’s something about that special place that really gets me motivated to play the best I can," he told the Augusta Chronicle.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

It won't guarantee him the FedEx Cup, but it'll put him in position to claim it again if others falter. Michael Collins -- Dustin Johnson ($11,700)  Now that the PGA Tour will switch the nines (finishing the Tour Championship on a par-5 instead of a par-3 at East Lake), expect DJ to be part of the fireworks in the final round since he's got a Sunday scoring average of 68.7. Last year, Johnson dropped a Sunday 64 and in 2013 he shot four rounds in the 60s.
DJ  ->  positive

Importantly, Reavie has been striking the ball extremely well in his last five tournaments; he has made every cut and finished as high as fourth at the St. Jude Classic. Reavie’s hefty 17.5 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks second in this week’s field. The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly.
Reavie  ->  positive

After adding to his soaring P/L with 200/1 each-way tip Scott Stallings last week, Dave Tindall picks out three bets for the PGA Tour's Genesis Open in California...  "A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

If I had to pick one of those venues as the one that correlates best I'd probably plump for El Camaleon. Last year's one - two in Mexico, Pat Perez and Gary Woodland, have both been placed here before and even though the OHL Classic has only been staged ten times in total, we've already had two players win both events, and at a very big price here (Mark Wilson and Johnson Wagner). And it could have easily been three.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Brendan Steele 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Steele has enjoyed a hot start to 2016, and continued that last week with a T20 finish at the Farmers Insurance Open. In six starts this season, Steele has one win and two 6th place finishes. His worst finish this year was 31st at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open.
Steele  ->  positive

There isn't really anything not to like here. Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,300)  FanDuel ($9,400)  Looking at my stats model ranks this week, it was a bit surprising to see Rickie right at the top but digging deeper it makes perfect sense. He ranks Top 20 in all my weighted stats highlighted by a 4th overall rank in SG: APP, 5th in Par 5 BoB%, 3rd in Bogey Avoidance, and 3rd in Sand Save %.
Rickie  ->  positive

Here are five golfers to consider for this week's card. Charley Hoffman - You can find Charley Hoffman with odds of +2500, which is a steal given his history at the Valero Texas Open. Hoffman not only won this event last year, but he had a top-five finish in 2013 and was a runner-up in 2011.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Adam Scott ($12,200)  We thought that Scott would be less great without the long putter. Proving that length isn't everything, he leads the Tour in strokes gained, putting.
Scott  ->  positive

Francesco Molinari is made for this type of event That lack of obviously compelling recent form has protected his price a little and if you can get 66/1 or bigger, he looks rock solid. There are no excuses on that score now returned to Florida, where he's also built up a fine record in the not dissimilar PLAYERS Championship as well as here at Bay Hill.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

This preview will look at all those available for the official European Tour fantasy game. Last 10 PGA Championship Winners  2016 Jimmy Walker (Baltusrol) - 14  2015 Jason Day (Whistling Straits) - 20  2014 Rory McIlroy (Valhalla) -16  2013 Jason Dufner (Oak Hill) -10  2012 Rory McIlroy (Kiawah Island) -13  2011 Keegan Bradley (Atlanta Athletic Club) -8  2010 Martin Kaymer (Whistling Straits) -11  2009 YE Yang (Hazeltine) -8  2008 Padraig Harrington (Oakland Hills) -3  2007 Tiger Woods (Southern Hills) -8  Quail Hollow Top 5s  2016 James Hahn, Roberto Castro, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Andrew Loupe, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson  2015 Rory McIlroy, Patrick Rodgers, Webb Simpson, Phil Mickelson, Robert Streb, Gary Woodland  2014 J.B.

Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

I think he makes a great play to build a cash game lineup around under $10K and I am banking on his large jump in salary to help keep his ownership down in GPP's this week. Kevin Chappell  World Golf Ranking (#26)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($9,300)  FanDuel ($8,000)    Looking at the new average DraftKings points tab on the cheatsheet we see Kevin Chappell's name right there at the top. Since missing the cut at the Genesis Open back in mid-February, Chappell has made every single cut(not counting non-DFS, team-even Zurich Classic) and has scored 50+ DraftKings points in all nine tournaments.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

He's also had a chance to win here, leading through 54 holes in 2016, and one of the more powerful players on the circuit is clearly advantaged by a relatively low-scoring test on a par 72 which doesn't punish his wayward driving. Although this is far from an all-out slug-fest, Houston is set up to mimic Augusta and that means little in the way of rough, so providing Lovemark can stay out of trouble the strength of his approach play and improvements in his short game should be allowed to shine. In terms of recent form, he's contended twice this spring - sixth at halfway at Riviera and then leading the field through 36 holes of the Honda Classic - and he's done some good work through the middle rounds on less suitable golf courses in his two subsequent starts.
Lovemark  ->  positive

He also fits the stat model in a big way as he ranks #1 on my sheet in Driving Accuracy, 9th in Strokes Gained: Approach, 2nd in Good Drive %, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, and 6th in Bogey Avoidance. On top of all that, after a disappointing T74 here in 2015-16 Reavie bounced back and finished with a Top 5 last year. Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#10)  Vegas Odds (10/1)  Draftkings ($11,800)  FanDuel ($10,300)    Making his first trip to El Camaleon and the OHL Classic, Rickie is the favorite to win and like I mentioned in the intro, is the only Top 10 player in the World Golf Rankings in the field.
Reavie  ->  positive

Anytime you can get the #1 player in world with a $1600 price decrease and projected lower ownership(in the top tier at least) you have to consider it in tournaments. Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#12)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)    He was the highest owned player last week and seen a $800 price decrease but I have a feeling he will be a lot less owned this week. He disappointed for the most part at Pebble Beach finishing with a T39 and ranked 43rd overall in DraftKings points.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

White Sulphur Springs provided a relatively benign test of golf with plenty of guys throwing out some very nice rounds on Old White. Overall, our picks were reasonably solid – we had a couple of very frustrating busts (Kisner, Ollie, Thornberry) but had nice results from guys like Nick Taylor, Danny Lee, and Jimmy Walker who performed quite nicely over the course of the week. We’ve still been slumping a bit overall, but I think we are firmly on the road to recovery now going into the ultimate PGA Tour Summer season scorefest.
Nick Taylor,  ->  positive

Statistically Rose ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 49th in GIR, eighth in scrambling, 13th in SGP and sixth in par 4 scoring. After coming agonizingly close to victory last year, Rose will be keen to try and put that right this year and should be right in the thick of things come Sunday. Phil Mickelson 16/1  The two-time Masters champion returns to Augusta National in great form after a T24 in Houston after an impressive final round 67.
Rose  ->  positive

In more than half of his seven visits he's been a definite factor and as we've seen since he won the second renewal to be played at this golf course, an affinity for the layout has been an absolutely key pointer towards success. What's more, Steele happens to be one of those players who really comes alive when returning to one of his favourite tracks. His other two PGA Tour victories have both come at Silverado, home of the Safeway Open; four of his best 20 performances in terms of world ranking points have come at TPC Scottsdale in the Phoenix Open; three visits to Paris and Le Golf National have resulted in finishes of seventh, seventh and sixth; twice he's gone close at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Steele  ->  positive

He's the FedEx Cup playoff leader heading to the Deutsche Bank Championship, which starts Friday at TPC Boston. Rickie Fowler is the defending champion in a tournament Jason Day just loves. For GNN Plus subscribers, you can access our NEW searchable database of PGA Tour results from 2011-present, our top-15 finish chart and season-long trends on DraftKings valuations.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Take the 30/1. Another of the plethora of players to finish T5 last week was Johnson Wagner and that makes him interesting at 100/1 here. That top five marked a real return to form after a string of missed cuts although T43 at the previous week's Travelers Championship did included an opening 64 to suggest something was brewing.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Kirk,  ->  positive

Pinterest Sam Greenwood/Getty Images  Other than that, nothing too egregious from the professor. Finau and Haas are solid, safe picks. Finau's quietly put together a strong campaign, ranking eighth in strokes gained: tee-to-green and fifth off-the-tee, and though he hasn't posted many top-10 finishes, Haas has been a top-25 machine in 2017 (11 in 17 events).
Haas  ->  positive

He also finished T9 at the Frankie Templeton Shootout, but as this is an unofficial event it seems silly to count it. Whilst Berger has hardly made a blistering start to the season, it has been steady enough and I am hoping he will build on that T7 finish last time out. On his debut at this event, Berger finished 2nd (lost in a play-off) to Padraig Harrington back in 2015.
Berger  ->  positive

Of course there have been changes made and like the rest of the field this will be new to him, but course form should still hold up to a certain extent this week, especially if a player is in form, which Fowler is. Fowler has five top-10’s in his last seven starts and also won the Honda Classic back in February, so it has been another memorable season for the young American. He needs to get a major win to really put himself at that next level and given how close he has come on numerous occasions, it would take a brave man to bet against him, each time he pegs it up at any one of the four.
Fowler  ->  positive

After regaining some self-confidence, look for Bubba to start posting some low numbers starting this week at Innibrook, a place where he has posted a top 3 before. Others to Consider: Charles Howell III ($9,400), Bill Haas ($9,200), Webb Simpson ($8,500), Graham DeLeat ($8,400), Tony Finau ($7,700), Chris Kirk ($6,900)  Player projections, stats models, DFS lineup builders and much more!

Scott Brown – $9,800  Scott Brown is drawing a lot of attention from the DFS golf world this week, being tagged the 4th most on FanShareSports.com. Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events.
Brown  ->  negative

There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event. Barring another withdrawal, which seems very unlikely, Murray should get back right on track at this easy course. As with most players down in this price range this week, Murray isn’t a statistical beast, but he is a good birdie maker, ranking 66th in birdie or better percentage this year.
Murray  ->  positive

For a player that excels off the tee, it’s no surprise that he’s performed well on some of the tighter tracks on Tour this season. With his distance (3rd, 11th SG: OTT) and strong control with his irons (49th SG: APP), List has had an easy time of scoring this year which is always a strong consideration at birdie courses: List sits 21st in birdie average (4.13/round), 26th in Birdie or Better % (23.17%), and his average approach distance when making a birdie or better is 189.2 yards – great for this course. His putter remains the biggest question mark.
List  ->  positive

Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner. Watson made the knockout stages at the Dell Matchplay, played nicely at the Shenzhen International before a final round collapse and then landed 5th at TPC Louisiana with partner J.B. Holmes. But it was at Muirfield Village where Watson really came to the fore for me this week.
Bubba  ->  positive

Most years they aim for around 13 on the stimpmeter.

Prior to that, Casey had started the season with back-to-back top-10 finishes and he looks exactly the right type of player for this test based on last year's leaderboard, one he worked his way up with rounds of 67 and 66 over the weekend - one better than DJ, one worse than Fleetwood, and third in the field. Paul Casey is all smiles at present  His record in WGCs last year read 16-9-5-11 and in an event where the ball-strikers may once again dominate, he's the only player in this field bar DJ who currently sits inside the top 10 for strokes-gained tee-to-green and has also done so at the end of every year since 2015. It's no secret that Casey is among the world's best in that regard and of course the issue is that it's almost 10 years since his sole success on the PGA Tour, but with the Ryder Cup once again on the agenda and having turned 40 last year, it wouldn't surprise me if he ended that drought in the near future.
Casey  ->  positive

Both have put better of late and have much to prove after slow starts to 2017. Other potential targets for large tournaments this week include Emiliano Grillo ($8,500), who was in the mix here last year, Danny Lee ($7,500), who is coming off two straight top-10s and Jamie Lovemark ($6,300), see my comments below. Sean O’Hair also deserves a shout out after landing two top-5 finishes in a row and being in a lot of winning tournament lineups last week.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament. A justifiable concern.
Streelman  ->  positive

Bill Haas – Play  I really like Haas this week and will be putting him into a few GPP lineups. I think Haas falls into the middle of the pack ownership wise and I am comfortable being overweight on that number. If he can straighten out the drive Haas is a player I think sets up great for when winds pick up as he can stay in contention in the rough weather through his scrambling ability.
Haas  ->  positive

His rank of 109th in Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee is also worrying, but he still a man for the big occasion. Spieth’s lacklustre figures in Putting and Off the Tee are slightly negated by his hugely impressive Approach-the-Green (1st) and Tee-to-Green (10th) numbers. Spieth also ranks 4th in Par 5 Scoring Average which may well come into play at this Par 72 track.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

In this article we give you our top value plays and sleepers for the week on DraftKings. Top-Tier Plays  Paul Casey ($9,500)  Paul Casey at this price is mind boggling. He finished 2016 as the hottest golfer not name Matsuyama and he has begun the new tour season where he left off, placing 12th, 21st and 3rd in his first three events.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

In an interview with Sky's Rob Lee he spoke of how he needs to sharpen up his work on and around the greens but that he was happy with his game as we approach the US Masters. Spieth led here with a round to go two years ago before being beaten by Holmes in the playoff so I imagine this home state event is one he's keen to win but at the same time, next week is of far more importance and it's hard to go backing any of these short-priced players with confidence. But for a few holes on the front-nine in yesterday's final, Jon Rahm played brilliantly at last week's WGC Match Play.
Holmes  ->  positive

That's really all you need to know as far as analysis on him as he's been good outside of the US for the past two years, has posted back to back sixth-place finishes in Euro Tour events and has three top 10s in his last four appearances here -- translation: he's a great value play this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

He ranks within the Top 40 in birdie or better % and in Par 5 scoring. Brandt Snedeker ($7,700) – Brandt Snedeker’s last few years have been marred by injury. Time and time again he keeps coming back and proving he’s still got game, only to come down with a new injury.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Shell Houston Open - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jon Rahm 2.5pts EW 11/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds:  If any player in the top bracket has the will and determination to succeed this week then it's Jon Rahm and for me he's always 100% committed to the cause, every event he tees it up at, so I don't see his mind wondering towards Augusta this week. His consistency has been amazing since he hit the PGA Tour scene, but it's worth remembering that 'Rahmbo' spent 60 weeks as World Amateur Number 1 and just a look at his amateur history shows multiple back-to-back wins and a level of top 10 result consistency which indicated that the man from Barrika, Spain was likely to be special.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Lee is above average in each Birdie or Better category and is 36th overall in 2017. Though it’s difficult to predict, Lee is also one of the better putters on tour as he’s 36th in Strokes Gained: Putting this year. Chris Stroud ($6,800) and Robert Garrigus ($6,600) are interesting bargain plays this week.
Lee  ->  positive

Look for Phil to dominate those two tracks and be in prime position Sunday to take home his first trophy in over 4 years. Mid Tier  Chez Reavie ($8,800 – DraftKings, $9,400 – FanDuel)  Chez again? Yes, Chez again.
Chez  ->  positive

So 66/1 about a player who finished 7th at the Sentry Tournament of Champions, where he shot 2 Eagles and 20 Birdies in 20+ mph winds, at a tournament which he won in 2011 seems a little on the generous side to me. A ball-striker by trade, Vegas has always been happy on the west coast and winning scores of -27/333 and -21/267 across 2 of his 3 PGA Tour victories tell you exactly where he is at when it comes to resort course style birdie blitzes. Wins here at PGA West and twice at Glen Abbey have featured Jack Nicklaus courses and 5th at TPC Louisiana (2016) and 7th at TPC Sawgrass (2012) also highlight that he can play more than adequately on Pete Dye designs with a little space to work with.
Vegas  ->  positive

Gary Woodland – $7,800  I guess I will never understand the Gary Woodland love. At $7,800, I’d expect at least solid recent form or course history, but Woodland has neither. Woodland is a sporadic golfer who can sometimes put together a solid round of golf or two and sneak inside the top 20.
Woodland  ->  negative

However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
Hatton  ->  negative

One To Swerve  Of the elite, I’m not really convinced that Henrik Stenson is playing well enough and his record in this event is modest. I’ll reveal my full line-up in Tuesday’s Playing The Tips feature. Does he have the calmness needed for this event?
Henrik Stenson  ->  negative

He also led the tour in GIR last season and ranked ninth in rough proximity. Glover is in prime condition and is looking like this may be the season he will get his first tour title since 2011. Ollie Schniederjans ($6,300)  Schniederjans spent 42 straight weeks as the World's No.
Glover  ->  positive

Martin hasn’t missed a cut since the RBC Heritage in April, including a T5 at the Quicken Loans National and racked up 21 birdies at The Barbasol Championship last week in route to a T6 finish. Just below the average price on DraftKings means Martin will be a lock for us in all formats. Chad Campbell $7,500 – “Big Tex” Campbell has been bringing the heat lately on the PGA Tour with five T20’s in his last seven starts.
Martin  ->  positive

He also shares another compelling fact with Reed from last year: with 7 top-10s in 2017, Charley is the highest player in the FEC not to have won this season. If there was an award for most improved player in 2017, Hoffman would have to be the winner after being 74th in the Official World Golf Rankings in February. From there 4th at Riviera and 2nd at Bay Hill powered him onto the fringes of the Presidents Cup conversation and he then proceeded to seriously contend at Augusta National leading after 36 holes and going out on Sunday in the second last group before fading.
Charley  ->  positive

This also comes off his 3rd place finish last weekend at the Wyndham Championship. With his strong form, history of playing well in the FedEx Cup, and his putter that can carry him through an event, Snedeker is an excellent play in tournaments this week, and you should be able to get him at a low ownership. Kevin Na ($7300)  He’ll be chalk.
Snedeker  ->  positive

His record at the PGA is more spotty, but Johnson is simply playing too well to bypass, especially at the this price. Francesco Molinari - $6,800 (80-1)    As a member of the PGA Tour this season, the Italian has 12 top-25s in 17 starts and sits an impressive second in strokes gained approach, third in tee to green. Molinari is eighth in driving accuracy, and usually you have to be a real short hitter to rank so high.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Kevin Streelman 1.25pts EW 45/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Kevin Streelman is always a dangerous player on any low scoring course where outright power is not the be-all and end-all. On a great run of form across his past 4 events which reads 18(Colonial)-13(Muirfield)-8(TPC River Highlands)-17(TPC Potomac), Streelman has a host of top results across resort-level scoring assignments.
Kevin Streelman  ->  positive

Also, look for me on Twitter (@DFSBenj), where I'll be providing much more PGA and MLB daily fantasy content. Key Stats:  Ball Striking  Strokes Gained Tee to Green  Par 4 Scoring  Strokes Gained: Approach  Strokes Gained: Putting  Greenbrier Classic Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Bill Haas (DK: $10,800, FD: $8,800)    Weak field events are Haas’s jam, and we get another one this week. Haas enters the Greenbrier in good form, as he’s made four straight cuts with no finish worse than 25th.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

1pt each-way Kyle Stanley at 200/1 Sky Bet (7 places; 1/4 odds) Stanley won’t be able to win on ball-striking alone but there are signs of improvement on the greens. A course record of MC-33-71 is slightly underwhelming but he finished T5 on the adjacent Dye’s Valley course in the 2015 Web.com Tour Championship.
Stanley  ->  positive

A big-hitter who finally saw his hard work in the off-season rewarded with a top-10 finish at Pebble Beach last week, Rodgers looks an interesting each-way player - particularly if he continues to putt well. Truth be told, you can get away with putting badly here - James Hahn ranked 50th when victorious and Johnson, beaten in the play-off, was 55th - so the focus is very much on ball-striking, which leads me to Luke List. This huge-hitting underachiever looked like he might finally prove himself capable of winning at PGA Tour level when contending on a number of occasions last year, always powered by his trademark length off the tee married up with quality iron play.
Luke List.  ->  positive

So too does El Camaleon, host of the aforementioned OHL Classic, where Piercy finished fourth on his last visit. With the Web.com events held here won in 20- and 24-under, Piercy's birdie-making ability is a further boost and he's by some way the best in this field for birdie average, both this season and last. His iron play has also been red-hot - again, he's the best in this field with his approach shots - and in 20 rounds this year, only once has he failed to produce good golf.
Piercy  ->  positive

The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois. -- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

This has mostly been off the back of some solid ball-striking too as he currently ranks eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 14th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and is also averaging over 300 yards per drive in 2017. In 2011, Stanley famously blew a win at this tournament with a meltdown on hole 18 on the final day, but bounced back the next week to win his first and only PGA Tour event in Phoenix. While I don’t expect him to win, his game is in fine form, and he has the experience and types of stats I want to target this week.
Stanley  ->  positive

Given a large number of those ahead of him in the betting will be using this as a warm up as opposed to going for the win, Henley arguably looks one of, if not the most obvious winner this week. Thomas Pieters 55/1 (MarathonBet, UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Whilst not in the finest form at the moment, Pieters looks an intriguing prospect on a course that he should be able to take advantage of. Pieters’ biggest strength is his length off the tee, but he is also a streaky putter and if he can find his touch on the greens, this test should suit.
Pieters  ->  positive

I’ll roster again this week. Jhonattan Vegas $7,300  Kyle Stanley $7,400  JT Poston $6,600  Hudson Swafford $8,000  Jamie Lovemark $6,800  Ollie Schneiderjans $6,700  I’ve listed the guys above in order that I like them. It should be a very fun week and an important week to watch as much golf as possible so you have a better idea of who is playing well going into next week.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

Stud Picks  Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Spieth gets the nod over Dustin Johnson this week for me. Both have won on Poa grass this year but Spieth seems the better fit for a new course with apparently very tricky greens and a layout where power off the tee might not matter much. For all Spieth has done he’s actually never won a WGC event so the motivation to get that in his trophy case is there as well, as is the desire to catch DJ in the OWGR.
Spieth  ->  positive

Looking at his statistics on the year (PGA only, doesn’t include his absurd 6-shot victory at the Irish Open), Rahm crushes in almost every key category:  4 th in Par-4 Scoring / 5 th in Par-5 Birdie or Better %  in Par-4 Scoring / 5 in Par-5 Birdie or Better % 20 th in Bogey Avoidance  in Bogey Avoidance 2 nd in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green 3 rd in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach  in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach 3rd from 175-200 yards / 90th outside 200 yards  The only categories that Rahm has struggled with this year is around the green (109th in strokes gained) and he’s only an above average putter, not an elite putter (59th). Although there are punitive bunkers around the greens, Rahm will still put himself either on the green or in great position so often that he can manage to give a shot or three back with poor sand save efforts. Play him with absolute confidence.
Rahm  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

The cream of the golfing crop are in Ohio for the WGC Bridgestone Invitational and while Jordan Spieth may officially be just the second best golfer in the world, our Steve Rawlings thinks he'll end the weekend ahead of the rest...  "Spieth's course form reads an improving 49-10-3 and last year's third was particularly impressive given how poorly he was hitting his irons. There were only 58 players in the field 12 months ago, After Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka and Davis Love III had all withdrawn, and Spieth ranked 54 of 58 for Greens In Regulation . He did extremely well to finish as close to the winner, DJ, as he did."
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He had a good week at the Wells Fargo finishing T12 and followed that with a T22 in Sawgrass at The Players, T10 at The Dean and Deluca and a respectable 26th at the US Open in Erin Hills. Most recently Casey has been playing quite solid finishing T5 at the Travelers which included four rounds of 69 or better to post nine under in total. The Englishman had a super week at Royal Birkdale shooting three rounds in the 60’s to finish T11 at The Open Championship.
Casey  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner @ [65.0] If you want another way to eliminate 2013 champ Rose, it's worth noting that nine of the last 10 winners of the US Open hadn't lifted the trophy before. Kisner is 33, world ranked 20th, was T12 in the 2015 US Open, has played in three US Opens, made the cut at Augusta, was T6 on his last start at Memorial, didn't play St. Jude and won the Dean & Deluca Invitational at the end of May.
Kisner  ->  positive

His play so far this year is good enough to land him within the top-60 in every major statistical category. To go with his stellar recent form, Casey has made starts here the last two years and has 17th and second place finishes to show for his work at TPC River Highlands. Stat Rank Driving Distance 58 Driving Accuracy 53 Good Drive Percentage 15 Greens in Regulation 5 Scrambling 9  If you’re looking for an excellent blend of recent form and course history, Brendan Steele ($9,000) is a good option.
Casey  ->  positive

The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four.
Kirk's  ->  positive

Walker also played poorly at East Lake which again is a factor. Before that though, Walker had finished T13 at the BMW Championship and 3rd at the Deutsche Bank Championship. The odds are stacked against him but no more so than they were at the PGA Championship and look how well he played that week.
Walker  ->  positive

The winning score at the Wells Fargo Championship has varied over the years. Most recent winner Jame Hahn took home the hardware with a -9 final score while Rory McIlroy's two wins (-21 in 2015 & -15 in 2010) were the two lowest in the tournament history. With the changes and new challenges presented for this years PGA Championship I am predicting a winning score of -8 to -10 but it will really depend on the weather.
Rory McIlroy's  ->  positive

Thomas Pieters – GPP – DK: $8600 FD: $8000  One of my favourite plays when there is a no-cut event. According to our VIP Research Station Pieters is first in the field in field adjusted birdie or better%, edging out the aforementioned Justin Thomas. Pieters is not coming into the event in good form but he is one of those players that often finds himself all over the place on leaderboards.
Pieters  ->  positive

He’ll be far lower-owned than he should be after two straight below-average results. Bernd Wiesberger ($7,100): Wiesberger may not win much but at just $7,100 he brings some good momentum and course history this week. Wiesberger has played this course each of the past two years, in varying conditions, and done extremely well placing 34th in 2016 and 22nd in 2015.
Wiesberger  ->  positive

This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day. He doesn’t have the best results at Muirfield, but it seems as though Day has found his old form.
Spieth  ->  positive

There are six Par-4’s between 450-500 yards here at Riviera, and with Reavie averaging 290 yards off the tee this season, his approaches from 150-175 and 175-200 yards this week will be important. Reavie ranks 7th and 9th in approaches from the fairway in these two ranges respectively, further supporting his case this week. Whilst there are obvious question marks about whether Reavie can win, especially in this company, his game is in perfect shape to play this course.
Reavie  ->  positive

Oppenheim has had moderate success in the fall with two missed cuts, a tied-for-18th finish and a tied-for-34th finish last week, but he had great success in the Web.com playoffs just over a month ago, when he registered two top-fives. Oppenheim should be looking for a big finish this week, given his status, and his recent form suggests this might be the week when he pays off with those willing to ride with him in fantasy. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Oppenheim  ->  positive

Kuchar’s 68.5 LT Adj Rd Score is the best in the field, and he’s tied for second with Brandt Snedeker with 5.3 percent Odds to Win. Kuchar has played in five of six tournaments here and has never finished worst than 25th. He is as close as it gets to a lock for a top-25 finish this week and has the consistency DFS players tend to seek for cash games.
Kuchar  ->  positive

He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events. Unlike Campbell, List is a bomber: His 309.8-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) ranks seventh in this field, and he made the cut here in his only appearance (2013). List has missed four of his last five cuts, but he finished 17th at the St. Jude Classic.
List  ->  positive

Despite grabbing the lead at the start of the final round, Rose struggled on Sunday, but if there's one thing we have learnt about the Englishman, it's to keep faith with him when he's playing well. Going back to 2012, here are Rose's performances in the tournament prior to the win: 5th, 8th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 22nd, 10th, 1st, 10th. You can add to that a 9th place finish at the Travellers prior to winning that AT&T National at Aronimink in 2011.
Rose  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
Bryson  ->  positive

I think they cut the water off, and they've done a good job." Webb Simpson (2013) : "I love this golf course because it reminds me of the course I grew up playing. You have a lot of options off the tee and greens are undulating and fast.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Even though it’s a new venue, the fact Berger scored T28 and T17 finishes on his first two visits to this event shouldn’t go overlooked either as I expect Eagle Point to play similarly to regular host Quail Hollow. At $8,300, a second career win isn’t out of the question here for Berger and he could be looked at as an exceptional value on DraftKings. MY SLEEPER : Geoff Ogilvy ($7,200)  I’m going with a pretty deep sleeper this week in Ogilvy.
Berger  ->  positive

Patrick Rodgers is a huge talent capable of going close Rodgers knows he belongs in a higher grade to this one and having won in Colombia on the Web.com Tour, bagged two top-15 finishes in Mexico at the aforementioned OHL Classic and contended all the way by the Pacific Ocean at Torrey Pines, everything looks in place for another step up the ladder. Crucially, the big-hitting 25-year-old looks really confident on the greens and if that continues, it's a matter of time before he's contending as he has done several times, including when second to Bryson DeChambeau at the John Deere Classic last summer.
Rodgers  ->  positive

On top of this all Harman finished T5 at this event at Bethpage Black in 2012 and impressed again four years later, finishing T22 at the same course and event. With the Bethpage Black form behind him and some solid current form, Harman looks good value this week. Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me.
Harman  ->  positive

After missing the cut on debut in 2011, he has since gone on to finish 38th, 2nd, 69th and most recently 11th here and I expect him to go better this time around. He was unfortunate to lose out in 2015, with Jim Furyk getting the better of him in the play-off after shooting 63 on the Sunday just to match Kisner, who had shot 64 in the final round himself. At 40/1, he looks good value to perform at an event he would have been 25/1 at best to win in the past, now he’s rounding into some good form once again.
Kisner,  ->  positive

Kevin Na at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - chance to prove a point dropping in distance from the US Open  1pt e.w. Bud Cauley at 60/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - close to a win and has some very solid form here  Our fully transparent tipping record can be found by clicking here . The introduction of strokes-gained data has revolutionised golf, in the same way that it once revolutionised baseball and will gradually do the same in every sport where there are millions at stake.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Geoff Ogilvy  3. Jordan Spieth  MY PICK : Louis Oosthuzien ($9,100)  Oosthuizen started the playoffs strong last week with a T10. While he was somewhat wild off the tee at Glen Oaks, Oosthuizen’s approach game was on point as he gained over 4.2 strokes on the field in approaches and was T3 for the week in Greens in Regulation.
Louis  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Dustin Johnson  Vegas Odds - 9/1  Draftkings - $11,300  FantasyAces - $6,100  DJ is starting to trend in the right direction after an 18th at the Barlays and a T8 last week at the Deutsche Bank Championship. His finish could have been better or worse depending on how you look it.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Australian Number 2 Day also won at Conway Farms in 2015 and naturally the former World Number 1 has a win (2015) and 2nd (2014) to his name here on the Pacific coast. Other results across Leishman's CV also link inexorably to Woods - and that is clearly never a bad template. 4th at Augusta (TW 4 wins), 5th at Muirfield Village (TW 5 wins), 2nd at St Andrews (TW 2 wins), 8th at Congressional (TW 2 wins), 3rd at Firestone (TW 8 wins) and 2nd at Cog Hill (TW 5 wins) certainly paints a picture.
Leishman's  ->  positive

Another top-10 finish is not out of the question. This Dude Likes Legos  Zac Blair is not in fine form — his 71.2 Recent (Rec) Adj Rd Score ranks near the bottom of the field — but he has the type of game to get around what’s expected to be a tough course. Blair’s 68.3 LT DA percentage is second in the field, and his 60.1 LT SC percentage ranks 15th.
Zac Blair  ->  positive

He ranked 11th on the Par-5’s and 25th in Putting, so should his putting pick up slightly, he can look for another big finish this week. Sitting at 51st in the World Rankings, Kizzire will be looking to crack the magic number this week, and will also want to reclaim top spot from Justin Thomas in the FedEx Cup rankings. He is currently just 259 points shy of Thomas, with both posting two wins and four top-10 finishes so far this season.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Hadwin lines up well for the par 70 track and does so at a reasonable price on DraftKings. Comparing his Vegas odds to his price point in the VIP PGA Spreadsheet we can see Hadwin is either mispriced by DraftKings or Vegas and I think I know which one is wrong. Nick Taylor – GPP Punt – DK: $6700 FD: $5400  Maybe it’s my Canadian bias coming through but here’s another Canadian that sets up for any par 70 course.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Casey checks the box in several categories we are diving into this week ranking 21st in SG: Approach, 8th in Scrambling, and 58th in Par 5 Scoring. I expect Casey to carry the momentum from The Master’s into Eagle Point and hopefully finish near the top of the leaderboard. Francesco Molinari ($15,300) – Francescooooooooooooo.
Casey  ->  positive

If he can get the flat stick working, look for his name at the top of the leaderboard Sunday. Others to Consider: Rickie Fowler ($12,000), Chad Campbell ($7,600), Peter Uihlein ($7,200), Cameron Percy ($7,000), John Huh ($6,800), Luke List ($6,600)  Be sure to complete your PokerNews experience by checking out an overview of our mobile and tablet apps here.

He's got 10 million reasons to play well. Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017.
Spieth  ->  positive

He can put this behind him this year though, as he continues to strike the ball beautifully. Of course, Scott’s putter is always going to be a concern but he has finished 13th and 16th in his last two starts whilst ranking 56th and 75th respectively in Strokes Gained: Putting so if he improves even slightly on greens he knows well this week, there’s a good chance he will contend. At this point, you are purely betting on whether Scott can putt even just respectably for four rounds, which at 40/1 I am happy to chance that he will.
Scott’s  ->  positive

Before missing the cut in Perth, Bhullar had finished T27-T10-T27 in his three co-sanctioned events in 2018, so he has been in solid form, which will hopefully continue this week. You can check out Jason’s full double preview here  Steven Gray – Webb Simpson to be the First Round Leader @ The Valspar Championship – 55/1 e/w (Betfair/PaddyPower)  Webb Simpson has been back to his best on the putting greens this year as he ranks 6th in strokes gained: putting so far in the 2018 season. Combine that with his usually accurate tee-to-green game and we might see him win again this year.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Steve Rawlings takes a look at the local challengers at this week's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale...  “This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.“  Three of the first four in the Top GB & Ireland market are English - Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey - but it's now 25 years since an Englishman won the Open Championship so we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Rose, Casey, Fleetwood and their fellow compatriots, even if one of them, Fleetwood, is playing very close to home. Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Recommended Bets  Back Rory McIlroy for Top 5 @ [3.15]  Back Jason Day for Top 10 @ [4.5]  Back Jon Rahm for Top 5 @ [8.2] The sky's the limit for the Spaniard so I'll chance the 8.2 for a top five. Finally, it's time for Jon Rahm to step up and be a force in a major and this long, wet course offers an obvious chance.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.

If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

Others: Sung Kang, Zac Blair  High-upside GPP Picks  Zach Johnson ($9,800): Simply put, I don’t think anyone is going to want to pay up to $9,800 to play Zach Johnson this week, despite his great record at this event. Johnson has endured a tough start to 2017 but his form over his last two starts has been much improved. Of note is the fact that even though he hasn’t hit it great in 2017, Johnson’s around the green and putting stats are both still inside the top 50 for the year, two factors which often pay huge dividends around Colonial.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

I think he’s a very solid value at this price. BARGAIN BIN  Charley Hoffman ($6,700) – It seems blasphemous to be hyped about a guy like Charley given how he has treated the DFS community over the years with extreme up-and-down performances, but Hoffman has been absolutely rock steady this entire year, and we know how well he can handle the wind given his exceptional track record at a spot like the Valero as well as his impressive R1/R2 at Augusta. He’s having the best season of his career, and I would expect him to more than deliver on his low price this week.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

As always, my best suggestion is to check the weather Wednesday night before making decisions. LAST FIVE WINNERS  2017 — Dustin Johnson -17 (over Thomas Pieters -12)  2016 — Bubba Watson -15 (over Adam Scott -14)  2015 — James Hahn -6 (in playoff over Dustin Johnson and Paul Casey)  2014 — Bubba Watson -15 (over Dustin Johnson -13)  2013 — John Merrick -11 (in playoff over Charlie Beljan)  2012 — Bill Haas -7 (in playoff over Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley)    WINNING TRENDS  Recent form is important this week: Each of the last seven winners at Riviera had placed 29th or better in the week preceding their victory at Riviera.

Rahm  ->  positive

While I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s a world-class player, he’s definitely a few cuts above his competition here at a very good bargain price. Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events.
Garrigus  ->  positive

The Swede landed the BMW PGA Championship in May at Wentworth with a stunning final round of 62. This title means Noren has won his last two starts in England, having also been victorious at The Grove last year, which bodes extremely well for this week especially as he has spoken of how much he loves playing in this country. Noren has yet to make a big impact in the majors although he is likely to have positive memories of his appearance at Birkdale nine years ago.
Noren  ->  positive

Scott Stallings was the 3rd Round leader last week at Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, but as we know closing out PGA Tour titles is never easy and Stallings was treading water on Sunday as Grayson Murray and Chad Collins played some nice golf on the back 9. He still had a chance standing on the 18th tee, but an errant drive delivered a closing bogey and Stallings finished in 3rd spot. But as we've seen from Vegas and many others in the past, when players are playing well they often have bouncebackability.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

1 golfer, Jordan Spieth is clearly one of golf’s brightest young stars. With a win and two third-place finishes in the first two months of 2017, he’s back to looking a bit like the Spieth of 2015, when he won five tournaments including the Masters and U.S. Open. Let’s dive into the numbers of the former Texas Longhorn who is still just 23 years old.
Spieth  ->  positive

If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
Justin Thomas.  ->  negative

A T9 last year, on just his second start at this course gives a lot of hope, and hopefully he can emulate that success this week. Since his T5 in Houston, Berger has finished T27 at the Masters and T36 at the Wells Fargo last week, where he seemingly failed to get out of cruise control. One of the stats which always comes up here, even if it doesn’t rank as my most important is Scrambling and Berger ranks 12th in that area this season.
Berger  ->  positive

Rahm is second to only DJ in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, and currently sits 11th in Carry Distance (299.0 yards) which shows just how long he can hit it; because of his distance, Rahm is a stud on par-5s (T16 in Par-5 Scoring, T3 in Par-5 Eagles). It’s not just the rookie’s game off the tee that sets him up so well here, but Rahm is very efficient with an iron in his hand: 9th in SG: Approach, and from that key 150-175 yard range, he’s hit 70.24% of greens in regulation (34th). He comes with a hefty price and the bitter taste of chalk, but has massive win upside this week.
Rahm  ->  positive

Perhaps with the Open Championship in mind, he'd taken the John Deere off his schedule for the last few seasons but in 2010 he shot bookend 65s to place T7 and the year before was T15 after another 65 on day two. Again, it's easy to baulk at the price of 20/1 but with five top fives this season, Hoffman has given each-way backers plenty of returns and, on current form and with no Jordan Spieth in the field, he must really have a great chance of getting the 'W' this week. Staying at the front end of the market, Kevin Kisner (20th SG: Putting) and Daniel Berger (24th SG: Putting) would have obvious chances at 16/1 ad 12/1 respectively.
Hoffman  ->  positive

With seven each-way places to go at this week, that means he would have landed the cash twice in three attempts. Stenson has actually made the top seven in seven of his last 16 starts in Florida and won the Players Championship in the Sunshine State in 2009 so it's always been a happy hunting ground for him. Looking a little closer at his excellent play here, he's shot over par in just one of his 12 rounds and last year Stenson opened with a 64.
Stenson  ->  positive

While his form at Quail Hollow isn’t spectacular, having only played here once since 2011 (T41 last season), means we can’t really weigh it against him very heavily. Casey has certainly performed well at other longer par 71 and 72 venues, such as Riviera and the Houston Golf Club, and there’s little reason to think Quail’s tougher layout won’t be a good fit for him. From a fantasy perspective, Casey also ranks as one of the better values this week as his $7,800 salary is the lowest it’s been since the Masters; this is despite his streak of constantly returning value, week in week out on DraftKings.
Casey  ->  positive

Two of Piercy's three PGA Tour triumphs have come in 'opposite' events - those held on the same week as a World Golf Championship or major - and this noted opportunist can bag another in the Dominican Republic. While Piercy hasn't played this course in competition, he has been third at designer Tom Fazio's Conway Farms while his love for playing by the coast on paspalum greens is demonstrated by strong form in both the OHL Classic in Mexico and the CIMB Classic held in Malaysia. He calls the Sony Open in Hawaii his favourite event on the schedule and has been runner-up there at a course which, visually at least, shares something in common with this altogether longer layout.
Piercy's  ->  positive

He has shown some great consistency this year finishing T5 at Pebble Beach, T3 at the WGC Mexico Championship, solo second at the WGC Matchplay, T10 in Houston, solo fourth at the Wells Fargo and a T2 at the Dean & Deluca in Colonial recently. Rahm has one appearance at The US Open which was last year in Oakmont where he finished in a respectable T23. Statswise he has the length to score around this course averaging just over 305 yards off the tee ranking 13th in driving distance.
Rahm  ->  positive

There is always a chance of a little bit of a hangover or drop-off in performance on the back of such a pivotal victory in Garcia’s career but balanced against that is the fact he is playing some of his very best golf at the moment. Justin Rose, vanquished at Augusta National, and former winner Rickie Fowler are other likely popular picks but I am going to take a chance on a couple who fall very much into the ‘improver’ category at three-figure quotes – Hudson Swafford and Patrick Cantlay. The former has threatened to be a very good player for a number of years and although a relatively late bloomer after his maiden PGA victory this year at the CareerBuilder Challenge, he remains the right side of 30.
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Steve Stricker  The old man still likes to come over to the PGA Tour from time to time when he's not crushing his competition on the Champions Tour, where he has finished second and first in his past two starts. Stricker still makes his way down to Copperhead, as it is a perfect course for his game, as he has made a career of being one of the most accurate players on tour ... who happens to hit a lot of greens and can still putt as well. He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach.
Stricker  ->  positive

He hasn't got a terrific Sawgrass pedigree but that can only go some way to explaining his huge price. Johnson fits the veteran bill nowadays and he's shown form here before when runner-up to Kuchar in 2012, while Walker, who finished sixth here in 2014, is attempting to emulate Day and win this event nine months after winning his first major at the USPGA Championship. Odds in excess of [200.0] were insulting.
Johnson  ->  positive

While not all his stats are strong this year he does rank 1st in strokes gained: putting and 4th in par 4 scoring and I’m sure his whole 2018 campaign so far will have been geared to peaking this week. He is going to win one eventually and having had a light schedule he comes in 100% fit and focussed and that hasn’t been the case with Day too often lately. If he can start well I think he will hang around all week and with generous place terms he looks worth an each way bet as back up to Spieth.
Day  ->  positive

Luke List - $6,400 (Field, 4-1)    List was a DFS darling during the fall season, and he notched his fifth top-15 cash of the season at the Sony Open in January. Since then, however, as fields have improved, List has gone T41-MC-MC. Still, he is a big hitter who tied for 20th in his Riviera debut last year, and he has decent GIR and proximity numbers.
List  ->  positive

Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title. Finau ranks highly in multiple areas this season, including top-25 in SG: Approach, Par-3 Scoring Average and Par-5 Scoring Average, all key areas this week. The one thing that will hold Finau back this week, and has done so for the majority of the season is his putting.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting. His entire game molds perfectly for Conway Farms, and he’s finished T13 and T16 in his two trips there.
Spieth  ->  positive

Pre-event pick, Scott Piercy, sits tied for 30th and five off the lead and he looks to have too much on his plate but James Hahn is close enough if good enough on -8 and I'm happy I followed Paul Krishnamurty in with his three Find Me a 100 Winner selections. Michael Thompson is alongside Piercy after a disappointing second round but Chesson Hadley and Grayson Murray are both alongside Hahn in a tie for 11th and I'm just going to cheer those on for now. 09:35 - March 30, 2017  A weather delay yesterday morning has meant round one of the Houston Open is yet to be completed and that's always frustrating when trying to assess the state of play.
Scott Piercy,  ->  positive

Could be the recipe for success this week. Mori Yoshimoto  @Bears3423    Last Week: 348.5 points  Last Week Rank: 5,177    Kevin Na ($29,500)  William McGirt ($29,000)  Lucas Glover ($15,700)  Kyle Stanley ($12,200)  Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)  John Peterson ($4,300)    ANALYSIS: Ball-striking is the name of the game here for Mo. If Valspar proves to be a worthy pointer like it often does than Cantlay's runner-up finish there looks even better.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

To take down a tournament, you will have to have the winner, most of the top 5, and everyone else in the top 10. Onto the final picks of this season:  Top Tier  Dustin Johnson (11,700)  DJ comes in with good form, winning the BMW Championship in his last start, and was 8th at the Deutsche Bank the week before. He’s also in the best spot to win the FedEx Cup, with a win or plenty of other scenarios as long as 2-5 in the standings don’t win.
DJ  ->  positive

Mentioned above, this course facilitates its share of low scores, and no one racks up the red better than Thomas, leading the tour in birdie average. I was surprised Berger wasn't on the professor's top 10. He won in Memphis just two weeks ago, and entered the final round at Travelers last year with a three-shot lead before firing a Sunday 74 (which is like an 80 at any other venue).
Berger  ->  positive

Finally Riviera is intrinsic with Casey, Holmes, Pieters, Schwartzel and Westwood all having top 5 finishes at Hogan's Alley. So Patrick Cantlay ticks many of those course links very nicely. 9th at Pebble Beach (2013) came when Patrick had just turned pro.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

1 - Ryan Armour, Charlie Beljan, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mac Hughes, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Peter Malnati, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Scott Stallings, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, D.J. Trahan, Jhonattan Vegas, Johnson Wagner, Nick Watney, Bubba Watson. Recent champions here include Vegas (a Tour Rookie); Swafford, Perez, Hoffman (all 1st time PGA Tour winners); Trahan and Reed (1 Win at the time); Campbell (2 Wins); with Dufner, Gay (3 Wins) plus Wilson (4 wins).
Jhonattan Vegas,  ->  positive

Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential. He’s a lock.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood – $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan. He was a joy to watch and has the approach game to put him with the World’s best.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  negative

Donald really should have won the Sony ten years ago when he was pipped at the post by Paul Goydos and he's another that's putting quite well. Selections:  Morgan Hoffman @ [140.0]  Luke Donald @ [180.0]    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Donald  ->  positive

High-value Englishmen Justin Rose ($9.3m) and Paul Casey ($9.5m) don't make the top 10 of the predictor model either. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Cody Gribble ($6.8m); 2: Daisuke Kataoka ($6.4 m); 3: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 4: Ryan Blaum ($7m); 5: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 6: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 7: Justin Rose ($9.3m); 8: Charles Howell III ($7.8m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($8.3m); 10: Branden Grace ($7.5m). Positives: Ryan Blaum stands out on a FPPG basis, ranking fourth across the Sony field for a mere $7m.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

It’s hard to predict these clusters early in the week but given the aforementioned fact that results will tend to be wide open in an event like this, it may be a good week to go a bit contrarian. One name who catches the eye in that department is Rick Lamb, who at $6,800 has made four of his last five cuts and finished top 20 in three of those same events. Two weeks ago he managed to find himself in contention with a 3rd place finish at the John Deere classic, and we are on a track that plays to Rick’s strength…his cannon.
Rick Lamb,  ->  positive

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 4 Winners:  2016: Justin Thomas (-23)  2015: Justin Thomas (-26)  2014: Ryan Moore (-17)  2013: Ryan Moore (-14)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Par 4 Scoring Fairways Hit GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Justin Thomas ($12,300)  Who else to begin with the two-time defending Champion, Justin Thomas? JT is now the 4th ranked golfer in the world, and it’s largely in part to his terrific summer where he enjoyed a pair of wins at the PGA Championship and Dell Technologies Championship, before a 2nd place finish at the TOUR Championship to earn him the FedEx Cup Title.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

TYLER DUNCAN – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  I mentioned earlier in the preview that this event has graced the Web.com tour for the past two seasons and Duncan is one player who has tee’d it up in both renewals. In those two outings Duncan has finished 33rd in 2016 and 3rd in 2017 and in eight rounds on the course his worst performance is 70. Clearly therefore Tyler has enjoyed his time in the Dominican Republic.
Duncan  ->  positive

He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
Snedeker  ->  positive

He’s an expensive play, but well worth blowing the budget up top for as he looks for a second win. Chez Reavie ($8100): Reavie is currently in the midst of a seven made cut-streak since the Byron Nelson, which includes a T22 in a tough PGA Championship field last week as well as a T4 at the St. Jude Classic back in June. Course history truthers will ignore Chez this week as he’s missed a handful of cuts at this course, but he did finish T9 at Sedgefield back in 2011.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

His play off-the-tee keeps him in the mix almost every week.

Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

STATS  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Off the Tee  Putting  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Birdie or Better %  Par-5 Scoring  Approach: Outside 175 Yards  Greens in Regulation  Par-3 Scoring  Top-Tier Golfers  Luke List ($9600): Consistently one of the best on Tour from tee to green, List is sure to be a popular pick on DraftKings this year, as he’s having a strong year and his putter is only losing a marginal amount of strokes (-0.051) when compared to years past (-0.426, -0.273 in the previous two years). List finished T3 here last year in shooting -16 over his four rounds and finished T27 in 2016; he did miss the cut with a 77-72 back in 2013, but that’s ancient history for List. This season, List has only missed three cuts (OHL, Sony Open, CareerBuilder) while picking up a whopping seven top-25 finishes in his 14 events.
List  ->  positive

He's a solid ball striker with balance on length, accuracy and hitting greens. After missing the cut last week, Horschel comes at a nice discount, and in a field this soft, he's a strong bounce-back play this week. Jason Rouslin -- Stewart Cink ($6,900)  Stewart comes home to Sea Island Resort course off back-to-back 15th-place finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
Dustin Johnson...  ->  negative

The former Bama product is playing great golf and I wouldn’t be shy to get some shares in your GPPs this week. Lucas Glover (6,600) – I have been riding the Glove this year and it has paid dividends week to week. The stat machine is ranked 6th in Par 4 scoring, 7th in GIR%, 17th in SG:T2G and 51st in BoB%.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

He ranks 30th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, 52nd in greens in regulation and 41st in birdies-or-better percentage after lining up par breakers with a putter. Hahn didn't crack a top 35 in four previous trips to Houston, but missed only one cut (2016). Aaron Baddeley  Even when he hasn't been in form, Baddeley has always made sense at the Golf Club of Houston because of his phenomenal touch.
Hahn  ->  positive

Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
Rickie Fowler  ->  negative

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.

Weather Forecast : The latest weather forecast for Atlanta, Georgia is here .
Spieth;  ->  positive

That could easily change at Firestone however, a course where Rickie has finished inside the top ten on four out of seven visits. Fowler’s last visit to Ohio paid good dividends too when he finished second to Jason Dufner at Muirfield Village, another classic mid-west venue with fast greens. Fowler is fourth on tour in efficiency from 450-500 yards and won’t hate it if this course plays tough again, he’s the best value among the top four this week.
Rickie  ->  positive

His Korean Open title is also interesting as he beat 2-time Major Champion (at the time) Rory McIlroy into second place. Kang can undoubtedly play and he's trending towards a prestigious first victory on the PGA Tour. 2017 has seen Sung-hoon finish 2nd in Houston, where he was pipped by Russell Henley and Kang was also in the heat of the battle at TPC Potomac (the other Steve Wenzloff renovation we have seen in 2017) when a rainstorm and no wet gear destroyed his momentum - he eventually finished 5th.
Kang  ->  positive

From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  negative

Johnson Wagner sat tied 30th and five back after round one in 2012 but every other winner this century has been within four after day one. Like Gomez, Vijay Singh trailed by five at halfway and by four after round three and they're the only two to be outside the top-ten at halfway and the top-four with a round to go this century. Gomez's eight-under-par 62 was a remarkable final round 12 months ago and yet he still needed extra time to get over the line.
Gomez,  ->  positive

That added to three top 15s in November so he's playing some good golf. One final mention - Jonas Blixt. The Swede made the top three last year, has won a PGA Tour event in California (2012 Frys.com Open) and cracked the top 20 at Torrey Pines two starts ago.
Jonas Blixt.  ->  positive

Broadening the TifEagle link out slightly, excellent performances on the pure TifEagle greens featured at Kapalua, PGA National, Doral and Bay Hill (from 2016 onwards) link in perfectly as well. My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Brian Harman has a decent enough record here and we know that the 33/1-40/1 price point is a sweet spot for previous RBC Heritage winners.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Per ESPN, “The winners of each group advance to a single-elimination bracket on the weekend, with the round of 16 and quarterfinals on Saturday, including live prime-time quarterfinals coverage on network television, and the semi-finals, finals, and consolation match on Sunday, with the finals reaching again into prime-time network television.” With the breakdown in hand, and without further ado let’s dive into our Final Four picks and our cinderella sleepers! MATT’S FINAL 4 PICKS  Dustin Johnson ($11,800) is the number one overall seed, and I can’t imagine him pulling a Virginia and losing in the first round. His group is pretty weak with Kevin Kisner and Bernd Wiesberger not bringing their A game.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Last year's 54 hole leader, Gary Woodland, putted well last week (for a change) but he was very disappointing in round four, soon relinquishing his chance with a bogey at the second and a double bogey at the third and I'm not sure he's especially reliable in-the-mix. Selections  Chesson Hadley came up close for me last week in Vegas and he's worth chancing again at a venue that really should suit given his sole PGA Tour title to date came in Puerto Rico back in 2014. His recent form figures now read a ridiculously good 10-1-2-46-3-2-4 and he's the epitome of a no-brainer bet.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

He then went on to win the BMW Championship at Cherry Hills at 66/1 and then lift the Tour Championship and win the FedEx Cup to boot! Marc Leishman was giving both Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth all they could handle at TPC Boston last Monday, but ultimately - with a 2-shot lead on the 10th tee - the pressure got to him. However from adversity we've seen players blossom and Leishman, who sits 7th in the FedEx Cup standings, has the kind of result CV that links beautifully to previous winners here Zach Johnson and Jason Day.

8th at the Erin Hills-hosted U.S. Open was Hoffman's second Major top 10 and was swiftly followed by 3rd at TPC River Highlands (Bent/Poa greens) and 20th at Royal Birkdale. However Hoffman's drive to achieve in 2017 has been there for all to see of late with a 2nd at Glen Abbey when we were last on board (losing in a play-off to Jhonattan Vegas) being followed by an impressive 3rd at the WGC Bridgestone (Bent/Poa greens). 10th at Plainfield (2011) and 13th at Bethpage Black last year highlight that he gets on well with New York golf as does 5th (2007) and 10th (2010) at Atunyote GC at the old Turning Stone tournament.

Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
Anirban Lahiri:  ->  negative

Weave in his continuously superb play just about everywhere and you'll appreciate that confidence entering either tournament. In this space a week ago, I proclaimed the probability that Rose would be my pick for the Masters. After going through the aforementioned process, I've changed my mind.
Rose  ->  positive

When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

One similar player, however, may be flying under the radar in his flat-brimmed hat: Kevin Chappell. Prior to missing the cut at the Quicken Loans National, Chappell had ripped off nine straight made cuts, with a win at the Texas Open, a top-10 at the Masters, and a top-five finish at the St. Jude Classic included. He is tied for 36th in this elite field with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score.
Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

Lock and load in GPP my friends! Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (16/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($9,500)  If you are looking for the chalk this week, look no further than Rickie Fowler. His price has reached the $10K mark for the first time since the Honda Classic where he took home the trophy and comes back to a course where he has had success.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Any tree-lined venue that plays firm and fast is fertile ground for the World No.10 and a trawl through his quotes from down the years will show you how he always views such conditions as his ideal. There could be a concern that this might turn into too much of a birdie-fest but Garcia won the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour last month with 19-under, the 2007 Castello Masters on his home course in Spain with 27-under and his two most recent PGA Tour victories with 15-under (Byron Nelson) and 18-under (2012 Wyndham). Since going wire-to-wire in Dubai, Sergio has finished 49th in the Genesis Open at Riviera and T14 in last week's Honda Classic where he improved from 48th at the halfway mark.
Garcia  ->  positive

10th at The Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens last year, he followed that up with a tied 7th place finish at the Valspar Championship. Wesley Bryan and Graham DeLaet are both shorter than 20/1 at the head of the outright market this week and with neither having won on the PGA Tour, I am more than happy to side with Scott Brown who is available at 33/1 with Betfred and Bet Victor.The New Zealander is starting to find a little form again on the PGA Tour and he heads to Puerto Rico on the back of consecutive top 25 finishes in Florida. Tied 22nd in the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook, Lee closed with a final round of 67 last week to finish 17th at the Arnold Palmer Invitiational.
Scott Brown  ->  positive

Henley’s form this year has been a little patchy however he seemed to click at just the right time when he closed with a 65 yesterday in Houston to finish in 8th place. So we’ve established Henley is running in to form at the right time however what makes him really jump of the page this week is his progressive form figures at Augusta. In four starts in The Masters Russell has gone MC, 31, 21, 11.
Russell  ->  positive

4. Paul Casey -- Casey has been in position to win each of the last two playoff events, and that's probably a safe bet to continue here at East Lake. 5.
Casey  ->  positive

It's notoriously hard to win back-to-back but Thomas has already done it this year and I couldn't let him go unbacked. I'm never entirely convinced by Brendan Steele in-contention and I think he should have won more than the two PGA Titles he's so far claimed but I'm happy to play him here modestly in the win market and more robustly in the three different place markets. Steele has held his form nicely since winning the Safeway Open in October and his sixth placed finishes at both the Tournament of Champions and the aforementioned Career Builder Challenge are especially encouraging.
Steele  ->  positive

I don’t really lack confidence so when those things happens I just stay confident and keep doing what I’m supposed to keep doing. I think that’s what really good players do.”  The weekends off gave Varner some more time to relax, reflect and recharge (oh, and he got to watch plenty of his beloved Cleveland Cavaliers; Varner was born in Akron, Ohio). He arrived at Harbour Town and made the cut at the RBC Heritage, finishing solo 68th.
Varner  ->  positive

After Spieth, I also like Louis Oosthuizen ($9,700), Charl Schwartzel ($8,100), Byeong-Hun An ($8,000), Graham DeLaet ($7,600) and Xander Schauffele ($6,600) as potential low-owned tournament targets. MY PICK : Russell Henley ($8,300)  There are a lot of interesting plays at the top this week in a stronger than expected field, but for DFS my main pick is going to be more of a value play. Russell Henley has played outstanding golf almost all season, with an early season equipment change doing wonders for his approach game specifically.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

He’s also finished top-five in three of his last four starts. Glue Guys    Marc Leishman - $15,100    The 34-year-old Australian is accustomed to playing in the trade winds that await the field this week in Hawaii, while he’s also coming off the best calendar year of his career and four top-five finishes in his last six starts. In 2017 he ranked 15th in par-four scoring, 17th in three-putt avoidance and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

A T3 finish at the Travelers Championship and a T18 at Whistling Straits in 2015 are both further evidence that he likes courses design by Dye and this may present the best opportunity for the Jupiter, Florida resident to win in his home state. Thomas ranks 1st in Par 4 Performance, and at -49 is a whole 16 strokes better than his nearest rival, Jon Rahm. In that pivotal range of 450-500 yards he ranks T17 as well, so he should relish a a test where good play on these holes is rewarded.
Thomas  ->  positive

List finished T3 here last year in shooting -16 over his four rounds and finished T27 in 2016; he did miss the cut with a 77-72 back in 2013, but that’s ancient history for List. This season, List has only missed three cuts (OHL, Sony Open, CareerBuilder) while picking up a whopping seven top-25 finishes in his 14 events. His highlight was losing in a playoff at the Honda Classic, and his next two stroke play events saw finishes of T16 (Valspar) and T7 (the Arnold Palmer Invitational.)
List.  ->  positive

Hard to pass him up. Justin Rose - $9,200 (12-1)    Rose may be the best of the Tier 1 golfers - certainly the best value at nearly $3,000 less than Spieth. On the other hand, Rose also has been slowed by back issues.
Spieth.  ->  positive

Dave Tindall previews the event and picks out his three best bets...  "The man who once shot 60 on the PGA Tour when still an amateur was a classy tied fourth at the Genesis Open in February and probably just needs the right course again." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Patrick Cantlay e.w. @ 33/1  It can be hard to muster enthusiasm for golf after the high of Masters week but, for some reason, the RBC Heritage at Harbour Town Golf Links has been one of my most profitable events on the PGA Tour down the years.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 5 of my published predictor are Jordan Spieth, Brian Stuard, Patton Kizzire, Cameron Smith and Brian Harman. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Alfred Dunhill Links / Safeway Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Oh, it's a par 70 as well so his third place in Par 4 Scoring Average adds to the mix. Also T13 and T17 in the last two editions of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Harman was T8 in the 2015 Players Championship so has a decent bank of Florida form under his belt. A strong player in the wind (he led and then finished third in the 2018 opener in Hawaii in very gusty conditions), Harman seems to fit the bill in so many ways this week and the 45/1 looks real each-way value.
Harman  ->  positive

I'll keep the local theme going with a punt on Bill Haas at 33/1. Haas has huge connections with the Carolinas. He was born in Charlotte, NC, went to college at Wake Forest (NC) and now lives in Greenville (SC).
Haas  ->  positive

He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam. UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Birdies are good: McIlroy’s ability to string together birdies will help him achieve the Streak Bonus in FanDuel’s scoring system and has helped him average a second-best 88.7 PPT on DraftKings the past 12 months. McIlroy’s 308.3-yard LT Driving Distance ranks third, and he’s one of just eight golfers in the field with an average of at least 305 yards. Rory is one of the rare golfers who can both hammer it off the tee and crush GIR: McIlroy’s 72.3 percent LT GIR puts him behind only seven golfers in this Masters field.
Rory  ->  positive

The South African, who is known to be a bit prickly at times, is fighting for his tour card this week as he comes in ranked 148th in the FedEx Cup standings. Sabbatini lines up nicely for Sedgefield, ranking inside the top-50 in Driving Accuracy (42nd), Birdie or Better Percentage (37th) and Par 4 Birdie or Better Percentage (46th). He also finished T8 here on his last appearance in 2013 and shot three rounds of 67 or better that year.
Sabbatini  ->  positive

1 spot in the OWGR, as if he needed any extra motivation. Justin Rose - $17,200    A T22 at the European Tour’s Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship ended Rose’s impressive streak of 10 consecutive top-10 finishes, and he also posted a trio of wins during that stretch. Rose placed fourth at the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open, and he heads into this year’s edition in even better form.
Rose  ->  positive

1pt each-way Martin Laird at 100/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses.
Laird  ->  positive

3rd at Sedgefield, 6th at Glen Oaks and 9th last week at Conway Farms since the 20th August, Webb is playing some great stuff right now and the North Carolina native has performed well here in the past. 5th in 2012 and 4th in 2013, Simpson has always been a prime performer on Par 70 formats and it's noticeable that Webb is hitting fairways and intriguingly putting brilliantly right now. 2nd and 7th across my 10-week Driving Accuracy and Putting Average tracker, Simpson might surprise this week on a course where patience is a key.
Webb  ->  positive

Selections:  Chris kirk @ 35/1 (Sportsbook)  Fabian Gomez @ [110.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter I was on board Gomez at this price when he won the Sony Open last year so he doesn't owe me anything and he might just be the one to cause this year's surprise. The Argentine messed up the final hole when in command in 2013 but he was still a maiden then and he's won twice since.
Fabian Gomez  ->  positive

He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year. Scott ranks 26th in SG:T2G, 14th in BoB%, 33rd in GIR%, and 37th in Par 4 Scoring. His game is trending in the right direction and hop on the train before it’s too late.
Scott  ->  positive

Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass. Stanley has a spot secured in the Open next weekend but my gut tells me this guy still grinds it out this week regardless to fine tune. Danny Lee ($9,200) – Danny Lee has been on fire since the Players posting 4 top 10’s since then.
Stanley  ->  positive

Molinari most recently posted his first top-25 of 2018 at the WGC-Mexico Championship, while he currently ranks 15th on Tour in SG: T2G and is top-10 in terms of proximity from 175-plus yards out. The Italian is 35-under-par in his last 20 rounds at the API, including three top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the event. Francesco Molinari - $13,800    Since 2010, Molinari is second to only Henrik Stenson in terms of overall scoring in relation to par at Bay Hill.
Molinari  ->  positive

Other values:  Gary Woodland ($7600): It’s always scary recommending Gary Woodland, especially when his price tag is this low, but especially this week where strong poa putters should do well. That being said, Woodland has been excellent at the Farmers (kikuyu/poa), with five top-27 finishes and no missed cuts in eight attempts, and he finished T38 here last year. Gary is a strong scoring golfer: 16th in Par-4 BoB%, 21st in Par-5 BoB%, 20th overall, and has already picked up eight eagles through his 20 rounds this season with a birdie average of 4.23 (T21).
Woodland  ->  positive

He does not have much for tournament history, but his $7,900 seems really reasonable considering the strength of this field. -- Jeff Bergerson  Patrick Cantlay  There's a lot to like statistically from the top of the price board on DraftKings this week, but with the bulk of the stars coming back from across the pond at The Open, Cantlay offers a lot of the same upside at a much cheaper price. Fair warning -- he will be highly-owned as the Twitter darling of DFS, but making him the cornerstone of a lineup still allows a lot of room for a higher-priced golfer, or the ability to differentiate by going for more balanced approach.
Cantlay  ->  positive

He followed that with a T9 at the WGC Matchplay, T13 at the Byron Nelson, T15 at Memorial and a T27 last week in Erin Hills. Leishman has a great record at this course with a win in 2012, T30 in 2013, T11 in 2014 and a T9 last year. He ranks 38th in driving distance, 32nd in SGP, 23rd in SG tee to green and 28th in bogey avoidance.
Leishman  ->  positive

Paul Casey finished sixth at the US Masters when last sighted and he's been in fine form for some time but it's now more than eight years since he won his sole PGA Tour title at the Shell Houston Open and he simply doesn't win enough to go backing at less than 25/1. Selections  Unless I get a fabulous angle in, I always take it steady at a new venue and so stakes are small this week but I couldn't resist a wager on DJ, who isn't that much shorter to win here than he was to win the US Masters, and I've had a couple of tiny bets on the two Eagle Point members - Simpson and Pettersson. The latter named is a really speculative punt but I quite like Simpson.
Simpson  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Michael Collins -- Jon Rahm ($10,200)  In 9 starts last season he missed one cut and only finished outside the top 25 twice in the eight cuts he made. He has big game and the quiet confidence of a guy who knows he can be one of the elite.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week. With a great finish, Casey can vault himself towards the top of the FedEx Cup standings as he currently sits 10th. He has been playing some great golf as of late and I think this is a good week for him to rebound from last week's 33rd place finish.
Casey  ->  positive

Has length and enough short game skill to take advantage of the par 5’s here and ranks 41st in Birdies or Better despite slow start to season. Other: Graeme McDowell, Kevin Kisner  High Upside Tournament Picks  Rickie Fowler ($9,900): With many focusing on Stenson’s record or Rory’s return to form Rickie should be in a spot to be 15% owned or less in big gpps on DraftKings. He has a third from this event from back in 2013 and comes in with great Florida form (won the Honda event) and great putting stats on Bermuda grass.
Rickie  ->  positive

On 17, Rose bogeyed and Sergio birdied, meaning they were tied once again, going down 18. Both players missed their birdie putts on 18, Rose from 7 feet and Garcia from 5, leading to a play-off. Rose found trouble off the tee on the first play-off hole and had to chip out from the trees, only managing to hit his 3rd shot to 14 feet.
Rose  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Jason Day – $10,000  Something is very wrong with Jason Day this year and I am not willing to risk the chance he might find it this week at Royal Birkdale. Day has been awful off the tee this year, ranking 97th in driving accuracy.
Day  ->  negative

Load up and don’t look back. Paul Casey ($17,200) – Casey is coming into the Wells Fargo Championship in great form. He has played excellent golf lately and it should continue this week.
Casey  ->  positive

Justin Thomas gets my Coors Light monies this week: His 67.3 Course Adj Rd score leads the field, and he finished in third place here last year. Thomas will be playing the course with Johnson and McIlroy in the GOAT opening rounds pairing, and perhaps the two birdie-making machines will inspire JT to improve upon his 13.9 LT Adj Bird Avg this week. ——  Be sure to use our suite of Tools to research all of the golfers and watch our PGA podcast and model preview on our Premium Content Portal.
Johnson  ->  positive

He’s always going to be a strong consideration at tracks where you don’t have to bomb the ball to take it down. Jon Rahm: What more is there to say? I admittedly did not play Rahm as I couldn’t quite pull the trigger at an $11.8K price point, but he very nearly sealed his second PGA Tour victory last week were it not for missing a number of exceptional birdie looks.
Jon Rahm:  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Cantlay.  ->  positive

I almost feel wrong writing him up here, but what am I going to do, not write up my pick to win this event? Spieth is looking to become just the third Two Time winner of The TOUR Championship, and the second to do so twice at East Lake (Phil Mickelson being the other). He enters in probably the best form out of the entire field.
Spieth  ->  positive

JORDAN SPIETH – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – ¼ odds 1st 5 FINISHED 14th  The next player I like from a price point of view out of the market leaders is Jordan Spieth. Spieth’s troubles which have been mainly on the greens this season have been well documented. However last time out at the Genesis Open there were definite signs of encouragement in a performance which saw him finish 9th and register 17th on the strokes gained putting stats for the week.
Spieth.  ->  positive

Weather Forecast      TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting at 21:00 UK and Ireland time on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Jim Herman -15  2015 - J.B Holmes -16 (playoff)  2014 - Matt Jones -15 (playoff)  2013 - D.A Points -16  2012 - Hunter Mahan -16      What Will it Take to Win the Shell Houston Open? It doesn't appear to matter what you do off the tee here, we've seen recent winners top the Driving Distance stats (JB Holmes in 2015) and we've seen winners rank as lowly as 50th and 61st (Hunter Mahan and D.A Points) for that stat. Last year's winner, Jim Herman, ranked 40th for DD and he ranked 16th for Driving Accuracy but that was the highest any recent winners have ranked.
Points  ->  positive

The Olympic champ has possibly just gone a little out of focus in the eyes of punters compared to some of his big-name rivals due to T38 in the WGC-Mexico Championship being his only piece of form in the past month. However, Rose had started the season with a second place (Sony Open) and two fourths (Farmers Insurance and Genesis Open). Significantly, they represented his best finishes at all three of those events and, in fact, previously he'd registered just a single top 10 in a combined 22 starts across those tournaments.
Rose  ->  positive

However, they used to say you needed six or seven looks at Augusta National before winning, until Charl Schwartzel, Spieth and Willett showed otherwise, and as mentioned, most trends should be used as a guide only. I can find no logical reason why Fowler will find his chance undermined by what happened 12 months ago. Given that he had previously shown a strong and immediate affinity with the course, making the cut in each of his first five visits including when fifth in 2014 and 12th in 2015, a blip can be easily ignored and I would be somewhat surprised if he's not in the mix for this title come Sunday.
Fowler  ->  positive

I wouldn’t be shocked if he contends or even wins this week, and I like the price on him for DFS purposes, too. MY SLEEPER : Joel Dahmen ($7,100)  Dahmen is a tournament target, but he’s one of the few fringe golfers in the bottom half of this field that I have some confidence in this week. He has been very solid over his last two PGA starts, and was tied for fourth in Greens in Regulation Percentage at Punta Cana last week and the Honda Classic (his second-to-last start).
Dahmen  ->  positive

All of the last five winners ranked inside the top-12 for Putting Average with four of the five ranking inside the top-4, so clearly a strong putting week is required here also. The following events are the ones to have featured Bermudagrass Greens this season and should be looked at, in order to find those who have performed well on this putting surface this season:  Sanderson Farms  RSM Classic  Tournament of Champions  Sony Open  CareerBuilder Challenge  Phoenix Open  Honda Classic  The following players in the field this week have ranked inside the top-10 for Putting Average on more than one of these courses this season:  Chesson Hadley (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ollie Schniederjans (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Sam Saunders (x2) (T11 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ben Martin (x2) (T19 in Putting Average overall this season)  Aaron Wise (x2) (T27 in Putting Average overall this season)  Chris Kirk (x2) (T109 in Putting Average overall this season)  Gary Woodland (x2) (T151 in Putting Average overall this season)  It is clear from the list above that both Kirk and Woodland raise their game in a big way when on Bermuda Greens, whilst others on the list tend to be putting well all season. Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Brown comes in ranked 179th in SG: Tee to Green, 179th in GIR% at 63.45%, and 153rd in Par 4 Scoring. I will pass on Brown and load up on List in that price range. Podcast
Brown  ->  negative

Dustin Johnson ($11,300)  So far, the Masters is the weakest major on his resume, but the course is built for a bomber like DJ, who should overpower the par 5s like Tiger in his prime. And that's who Johnson most resembles right now after winning his last three starts. (UPDATE: DUSTIN JOHNSON IS OUT!
Johnson  ->  positive

This is the perfect chance for Reed to kick-start his year, as he prepares for the first major of the season – The Masters in April. His course form was a big factor into picking him this week and generally speaking 33/1 is a big price for a player of Reed’s calibre, especially at a course he tends to play well at. Matt Jones 125/1 (Bet365, Betfred, StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  Matt Jones no longer has a PGA Tour card, so he will be relying on good performances in his limited starts.
Reed  ->  positive

He started the season with a T13 at the Safeway Classic and followed that with a T17 at the CIMB Classic, T15 at the CJ Cup, T14 at OHL Classic and a T18 last week at the Sony. Reavie has played well at this event before finishing T17 in 2016 and T12 last year. He is playing consistently well recently and that should continue here this week.
Reavie  ->  positive

Yes, his short game is underestimated and at a tournament where he finished 11th in 2014 over the road at Congressional Country Club when in worse form than he is right now, I can see the Par 70-positive Horschel loving the TPC Potomac challenge this week. Result: T26  Xander Schauffele 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I'm sure that Xander Schauffele would like to earn an invite to the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and based on his current play that's more than a distinct possibility. 14th at TPC River Highlands last week - which could have been a top 5 finish without a disappointing double bogey on the 17th - Schauffele is playing some extraordinary golf right now.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Opens have produced the following winners, in order. Angel Cabrera    Tiger Woods    Lucas Glover    Graeme McDowell    Rory McIlroy    Webb Simpson    Justin Rose    Martin Kaymer    Jordan Spieth    Dustin Johnson    Only Spieth and Woods will be remembered on this list as being all-time great putters, and Tiger is probably the best ball-striker ever (and Spieth the most underrated of his generation). Looking back at Oakmont last year, Johnson was No.
Johnson  ->  positive

Torrey Pines is one of the most iconic and classical golf courses in the world and naturally its association with Tiger Woods across both this tournament and the U.S. Open adds kudos. The winners' list since 2000 was exclusively made up of Major winners and previous PGA Tour winners, until Jon Rahm's dramatic victory here 12 months ago. US players dominate the champions list, but Jon Rahm and Jason Day in 2015 added their names to an exclusive list of international winners which reads Gary Player (1963) and Jose Maria Olazabal (2002).
Jon Rahm's  ->  positive

Russell Knox has really taken to Harbour Town. In his first four appearances here — over the past four seasons — Knox has finished T11-T2-T18-T9. He might be a divisive figure this week, however, as his recent form is quite poor.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

FedEx Cup champion Justin Thomas is looking for three straight wins in the CIMB Classic at TPC Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this week. Justin Thomas has won the last two editions of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the USPGA champion will be looking to become the first player on the PGA Tour to win a tournament three years running since Steve Stricker achieved that feat in the John Deere Classic between 2009 and 2011. A limited field of 78 players will tee it up at TPC Kuala Lumpur with Justin Thomas and World Number 3 Hideki Matsuyama the star attractions.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

RESULT: MC  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 45/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link:  Now I know that the standard winner at Colonial has course experience and preferably a previous top-10 finish here in their back pocket, but course debutants such as Paul Casey, Harris English, John Huh and Bryce Molder have all finished in the each-way spots in recent years. Encouragement for Jon Rahm backers, but I also think Billy Horschel is well worth consideration. Yes he has no course experience, but top-level results at correlating courses such as GC of Houston (2nd 2013), TPC San Antonio (3rd 2013 & 2015, 4th 2016), TPC Southwind (10th 2013, 6th 2014, 8th 2015), TPC Boston (2nd 2014), East Lake (7th 2013, 1st 2014) and Sea Island (2nd 2016) highlight a player who'll find the technical test at Colonial this week right up his street.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Focusing on players with strong Driving Distance who can also hit Greens In Regulation and have been playing well recently looks to be a possible way to uncover some value this week. The Studs  Once again, Dustin Johnson ($11,900) is a massive favorite, currently checking in with 16.7 percent odds to win. In the 10 tournaments since 2014 he’s had a 15+ percent chance to win, DJ has averaged 97.20 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +17.95 Plus/Minus and 70.0 percent Consistency.
DJ  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7200): For whatever reason, Kyle Stanley has been consistently under-priced on DraftKings event after event – all he’s done this season is average 68.25DK points, make 10 of 12 cuts, and finish in the top-25 six times (50%). He’s coming off a T8 at the Shell Houston Open where he hit 79.17% of his greens, which is an example of just one reason to use Stanley this week, his GIR%. Stanley is 5th on Tour in that category which goes along with his 12th ranking in SG: Approach, 6th in SG: Tee to Green, and 7th in Proximity to the Hole.
Stanley  ->  positive

He doesn't hit the ball far off the tee but is deadly accurate ranking 22nd in Driving Accuracy, 39th in GIR, 20th in SG:APP, and 39th in SG: T2G last season and ranked 14th in Birdie average. Even at a mid $8K price I would consider Cejka in all formats. Graham DeLaet  World Golf Ranking (166)  Vegas Odds (101/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FantasyAces ($4,500)    Back to my Canadian bias early in the new season.
Cejka  ->  positive

It checks out statistically(via FNGC) as well as you can see below over his last four rounds on the course. Austin Cook  World Golf Ranking (#118)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FanDuel ($9,800)  I wrote about him last week in the stats section and have upgraded him to the form section this week as he has now made all six cuts in his rookie season including a win at the RSM Classic. From a fantasy perspective, he has been very consistent with 70 or more DraftKings points in five of those six tournaments and is now averaging 84.4 on the season.
Austin Cook  ->  positive

Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds. His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day.
Chappell  ->  positive

Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
Brown  ->  negative

That would end our weekend early. Past Winners  2016 Charley Hoffman  2015 Jimmy Walker  2014 Steven Bowditch  2013 Martin Laird  2012 Ben Curtis  2011 Brendan Steele  Key Statistics  With the course coming in at a monstrous 7,522 yards, we are going to want to target the best ball strikers.

Kisner  ->  positive

The PGA Tour heads for West Virginia this week where New Zealand’s Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic over The Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs. Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic this week against a field that includes Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Four places in The Open Championship are available to the top finishers who are not already exempt for Royal Birkdale.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

The stats show that he's finished second and first in Scrambling for the last two weeks. He's also putting well (3rd SG Putting Phoenix, 19th SGP Pebble) although Mickelson being Mickelson he still can't hide his obsession with driving distance. "I've really had to increase speed to hang with a lot of the younger guys," he said at Pebble.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson's old caddie, Jim 'Bones' Mackay, is stepping in and he'll probably be an upgrade on Thomas's father, who stepped in at halfway last week, but Bones hasn't been to Waialae this century and I think it's a sizable negative. Marc Leishman looks plenty short enough given his wins to runs ratio and the fact that he went AWOL again in-contention last week and last week's pick, Brian Harman, looks way too short too at around [23.0]. I know he contended all week and finished an impressive third but he was available at almost three times the price in a field a third the size last week.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Horsfield has twice qualified for the U.S. Open but missed the cut on both occasions, and whilst he has played a handful of times on the PGA Tour he is still yet to better his T48 finish at the RBC Candian Open, so why will it be different this week? Well after romping home to an eight-stroke victory at the final stage of Q-School after six gruelling rounds, it appeared Horsfield was finally ready to make the big step in the professional game and he has shown a few signs of doing just that since. It has been up and down so far, missing five cuts in his first eight starts since getting his card but when making the weekend, he has been extremely impressive.
Horsfield  ->  positive

I think he picks up his second PGA title this week, and biggest win of his career. MY SLEEPER : Ian Poulter ($6,600)  Poulter is an easy person to overlook this week in DFS given the quality of THE PLAYERS field, but at $6,600 he makes for the perfect likely low-owned tournament target. The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season.
Poulter  ->  positive

He ranks sixth on Tour in SG: Tee-to-Green, 10th in SG: Off-the-Tee, 16th in birdie average and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green. Brendan Steele - $15,000    The 2011 Texas Open champion has finished top-15 in four of seven appearances at the event, while he currently ranks fifth in SG: OTT, eighth in GIR percentage, eighth in birdie average and 15th in SG: T2G. Steele missed his first cut of the entire season during his previous start at the Masters, but he remains inside of the top-15 in the FedExCup standings thanks to six top-20s and a win already this season.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

To be up to second in the world rankings already is a phenomenal achievement given that there are so many other young talents being feted so the more I look at the 8/1, the more I think it's okay. Rahm pulls off the trick of sounding both humble and flowing with confidence at the same time and after his win at the CareerBuilder Challenge on Sunday, achieved with a closing 67, he said: "It was really supreme ball striking on my part today. Especially on the back nine I hit the ball as good as I can, didn't miss many shots.
Rahm  ->  positive

He shot 70 on Sunday to save face and ensure another decent, if unspectacular week at the Masters. After starting so brightly last week, Fitzpatrick will naturally be disappointed with his 32nd place finish at Augusta, but he can put that all behind him with a win here. His 2017 highlights include a T5 finish in Dubai, a T16 in the WGC-Mexico and a T13 at Bay Hill, so he has definitely shown flashes of form since the turn of the year.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Last week he backed that up to produce his best finish at Augusta posting a 28th place and I am confident he can continue his good form this week at one of his favourite venues on tour. SI WOO KIM – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 2nd  Talking of prices I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw the young South Korean Si Woo Kim being given three figure quotes this week. Here we have a world class player whose career breakthrough result came at another Pete Dye design at TPC Sawgrass.
Si Woo Kim  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Course history truthers will ignore Chez this week as he’s missed a handful of cuts at this course, but he did finish T9 at Sedgefield back in 2011. Reavie has shown he can compete in scoring fests this season, going a combined -58 in four easy tests during the fall swing season (from the Shriners to CareerBuilder), and fits the same mould as Kevin Kisner to a smaller degree:  5 th in Driving Accuracy (71.66%)  in Driving Accuracy (71.66%) Excellent in Approaches above 150 (36 th , 79 th , 19 th )  , 79 , 19 ) 26 th in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 th in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%)  in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%) 8 th in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 th in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%)  in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%) 1st in Proximity to the Hole  The one area Reavie has struggled has been with the flatstick in hand, losing 0.940 strokes in 99 events played on Bermuda, but he’s actually had a much better season in that regard; Reavie is 64th in SG: Putting overall and a spectacular 16th in 3-Putt avoidance, but he does struggle outside 10 feet. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Brian Gay ($7300): On an easy track that basically amounts to a proximity and putting contest, there are few better putters worth a punt than Brian Gay – Gay has gained 1.785 strokes putting on Bermuda (1.663 elsewhere).
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice. Casey has played Augusta well the last 2 years finishing 4th and 6th. He also comes into the Masters in great form with 6 straight made cuts.
Casey  ->  positive

Lock him in. MID TIER  Rickie Fowler ($8,900) – Pay no mind to his recent history on this course – Fowler has been playing elite-level T2G golf this year, and he’s got every tool necessary to succeed at this golf course. I have absolutely no doubt at all that he will at least make the cut this year, and he’s got a pretty good shot of being quite relevant on the weekend.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Pieters is here on a sponsor’s exemption, likely because Feb. 21 is the first cutoff to qualify for the WGC-Mexico Championship, with the OWGR's top 50 getting in. Luke List - $6,400 (Field, 4-1)    List was a DFS darling during the fall season, and he notched his fifth top-15 cash of the season at the Sony Open in January. Since then, however, as fields have improved, List has gone T41-MC-MC.
List  ->  positive

DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Chris Kirk - $11,300 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 15-1)    We're usually not a fan of taking the priciest golfer on the DraftKings board unless he's named McIlroy, Spieth, etc. But Kirk checks all the boxes this week: He was the winner in 2013, then followed it up with a T4 in 2014 and T18 last year. He's currently playing well, tied for the tour lead with three top-10s on the young season.
Kirk  ->  positive

Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead. While he’s only four for six in cuts made at this event, three of those finishes have been 25th or better and they include a third place from back in 2013.
Tringale  ->  positive

Obviously, it's concerning to see any player struggle so badly but the slightly faster surfaces of Riviera may well help and he's certainly better suited by the layout of the golf course, having been third, sixth, seventh, eighth, 11th and 12th here since his 2006 debut. Holmes has only failed to make the weekend once at Riviera, but that came in 2013 - the year he suffered terribly with ankle and elbow injuries which limited him to just five PGA Tour starts, four of which resulted in missed cuts. Second in strokes-gained: tee-to-green here in 2016, Holmes is fancied to go well if able to return to the form he showed at Torrey Pines.
Holmes  ->  positive

Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four. Chris Kirk will be my pick.
Kirk  ->  positive

3rd at Sedgefield, 6th at Glen Oaks and 9th last week at Conway Farms since the 20th August, Webb is playing some great stuff right now and the North Carolina native has performed well here in the past. 5th in 2012 and 4th in 2013, Simpson has always been a prime performer on Par 70 formats and it's noticeable that Webb is hitting fairways and intriguingly putting brilliantly right now. 2nd and 7th across my 10-week Driving Accuracy and Putting Average tracker, Simpson might surprise this week on a course where patience is a key.
Simpson  ->  positive

He hasn't got a terrific Sawgrass pedigree but that can only go some way to explaining his huge price. Johnson fits the veteran bill nowadays and he's shown form here before when runner-up to Kuchar in 2012, while Walker, who finished sixth here in 2014, is attempting to emulate Day and win this event nine months after winning his first major at the USPGA Championship. Odds in excess of [200.0] were insulting.
Walker,  ->  positive

Not that his success at The Memorial Tournament was a walk in the park mind you - opening rounds of 65 on Thursday and Friday had seen the 40 year-old seemingly cruising to a 4th regular PGA Tour title before a Saturday round of 77 firmly slammed the brakes on. It's to Ohio-born Dufner's credit then that he rallied in the final round to beat Rickie Fowler and Anirban Lahiri by 3 strokes when many a player would have crumbled after such a damaging day at the office. The former US PGA Champion is another who ranks well in the Total Driving category (20th in 2016; 25th in 2017 to date) and although his averages suggest a 291 yard driving distance, he can be sneaky long off the tee when he chooses to hit the ball at maximum capacity.
Dufner's  ->  positive

Rahm trails only Johnson with his 83.8 DraftKings points per tournament over the past calendar year. Paul Casey: Casey leads the field with his 66.6 Recent Adj Rd Score, and his 16.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for fifth. Paul has been assaulting the greens lately: His 77.8 Recent GIR percentage is third overall.
Paul Casey:  ->  positive

Predictor Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select at $8.6 million and there's more detail on him in the FPPG section below. Hideki Matsuyama is a low-risk/high price play, but his record here is exceptional. Ranked 2nd in Ball Striking season to date Jordan Spieth is hitting form from tee-to-green at just the perfect time for TPC Scottsdale, where GIR% is king.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

It's a tricky one." Stenson said he would be heading to Birkdale, in the northwest of England, on Sunday evening. "You never know, it might be the only time we're defending champion at the Open Championship so I might as well enjoy it," Stenson said.

Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Other values:  Gary Woodland ($7600): It’s always scary recommending Gary Woodland, especially when his price tag is this low, but especially this week where strong poa putters should do well. That being said, Woodland has been excellent at the Farmers (kikuyu/poa), with five top-27 finishes and no missed cuts in eight attempts, and he finished T38 here last year. Gary is a strong scoring golfer: 16th in Par-4 BoB%, 21st in Par-5 BoB%, 20th overall, and has already picked up eight eagles through his 20 rounds this season with a birdie average of 4.23 (T21).
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

A T2 at the Dean & Deluca a week before a T13 finish at the Memorial Tournament suggests he is finding his better stuff at the right time. The reason Spieth is not dominating as he has in the past is his play with the putter this season. Before, Spieth was just streets above on the greens, but so far this season he ranks just 40th in Strokes Gained: Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Rain had softened the course nicely and the fact that he started out way before the leaders was most advantageous. As the day wore on the air appeared heavier and making birdies wasn't quite as easy as it had been when Holmes embarked on his final round. All the stars aligned for Holmes, as they had done for Jones 12 months earlier and in the fullness of time, these two results could well be viewed upon as freakish.
Holmes  ->  positive

Looking at FanShare in the $6,000 - $7,900 range, we see he is ranked 3rd in overall tags but T9 in start recommendations which could leave us with extreme value if he is under 20% owned. Tyrell Hatton  World Golf Ranking (#18)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,500)  FanDuel ($7,600)  Speaking of that $7K range, I love Hatton this week from a GPP perspective. He has only been tagged five times thus far, and only twice for a start so look for the ownership to be in the sub 5% range this week.
Hatton  ->  positive

That Lovemark brings power to the table is of particular interest and I put him up for this event last year on the strength of some eye-catching Dye form, a decision he vindicated by going down in a play-off to Stuard, who didn’t miss a single putt inside 10 feet all week. Lovemark hasn’t had the best of seasons but he doesn’t look far away, and playing alongside a partner who can get up and down from anywhere and is so easy to get along with should guarantee that he’s fully focused for this return to the scene of his standout PGA Tour performance. Seung-hul Noh impressed when winning the Zurich Classic three years ago and is interesting alongside An, who was second on his sole visit, beaten in the same play-off as Lovemark.
Lovemark  ->  positive

That could change before Thursday, but for now, it looks like we'll get prime scoring conditions this week. Players to Watch      Jon Rahm  Faded over the weekend last week on a tough Torrey Pines South. Now he'll head to his old stomping grounds in Scottsdale, the area he played his college golf.

Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter. Holmes has struggled on these greens in the past, too, but he's still managed three top-15 finishes including in 2010, when he was in command through 54 holes but lost his rhythm in miserable weather as organisers rushed the field through to the finish. Last time out he was bogey-free through the middle two rounds and kept it going deep into Sunday in Houston, where he's a past champion, and that came thanks to a brilliant tee-to-green performance, just as we'd seen at both Bay Hill and in the Valspar Championship previously.
Holmes  ->  positive

I never thought I’d see the day, but the guy is simply playing too good with too much consistency to chalk it up to anything else. I’m sure now that I’ve made this call that he’ll go back to being the Hoffman we know and hate with his signature DFL potential, but until then, he’s been a T2G sensation this year playing the best golf of his entire career. Ian Poulter: A nice performance by Poulter (and one that saved me a lot of money with my 5/6 cash line hanging on!)
Hoffman  ->  positive

I will buy him until I am blue in the face. Jon Rahm ($9,600) – As long as DK continues to offer Rahm at under $10,000, I will continue to buy him. He’s just too strong of a golfer with too great of a chance to ship on any given week to fade.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

The greens here will be pretty quick measuring roughly 13 on the stimp so strokes gained putting will be another stat to consider on this course. Phil Mickelson 12/1  After an early finish at the WGC Matchplay last week, Phil should be primed and ready to go for a competitive couple of weeks starting this week in Houston. Lefty has been playing some great golf this year with a win and three top 10’s in his last five starts.
Phil  ->  positive

So, first up, is a man who has cracked the top 10 at Torrey Pines in each of the last two years. Martin Laird finished 33rd in Driving Distance last year (298.5 yards) and can really smash it off the tee box. He made the cut here just twice in his first five visits but has really started to work out what's needed in recent years.
Martin Laird  ->  positive

Like Gomez, Vijay Singh trailed by five at halfway and by four after round three and they're the only two to be outside the top-ten at halfway and the top-four with a round to go this century. Gomez's eight-under-par 62 was a remarkable final round 12 months ago and yet he still needed extra time to get over the line. Brandt Snedeker backers will have felt quite rightly aggrieved given he led or co-led after every round and despite Gomez's heroics, I'm going to be concentrating on the frontrunners in-play.
Gomez,  ->  positive

His 69.2 Long-Term Adj Rd Score is tied for eighth in the field; he has a superior mark to Alexander Noren, who is $10,100. Henley is a former winner here (2014) and has been striking the ball well of late. At just $7,700 he’s in play in all contest formats.
Henley  ->  positive

2nd (Pebble), 5th (Doral), 2nd (St Jude) and 2nd (Troon) have all been off the back of a quiet previous week appearance in 2016. RESULT: MC  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  The punt of last week for many, we know that Billy Horschel loves the FedEx Cup Playoffs and we also know that he's playing rather well right now. Whilst other players of a similar standing such as J.B. Holmes, Scott Piercy and Bill Haas enter the next 2 PlayOff tournaments with the full glare of Ryder Cup attention set firmly upon them, Horschel enters with no expectations apart from his own - plus plenty of momentum.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Naturally on his last outing in late November, Jon won his biggest title to date when securing the DP World Tour Championship. The European Tour finale since 2012 had always been won by a player with a previous top-7 finish, but Rahm showed his true world class by winning on course debut - taking the opportunity when Justin Rose collapsed on the back 9. Rahm is so good and so talented that he bucks trends, simple as that.
Jon  ->  positive

McIlroy has repeatedly shot himself in the foot by carding a 77 or over in six of his last seven Augusta starts but he's still managed 10-4-8 the last three years and could easily set a PB this time even though I personally can't quite see him winning due to a combination of the course being in his head and his less-than-stellar putting. Rickie Fowler is as short as 16s in some places but to get him at 14s without DJ, Spieth and McIlroy has to be good business and I think it makes sense rather taking him at 22s outright. I'd still be delighted if he won but, as stated, he could still land the full 14/1 by finishing second, third or third.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Instead, I'm going to dip down a bit. I've already used Webb Simpson so that leaves me with ZJ, Phil, Kuchar, or Berger. The pick of the Ryder Cup litter, really.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Matsuyama was sidelined for over a month and has managed just one stroke play start since, which leaves the risk that he's undercooked. Hideki Matsuyama went off 12/1 for the last major championship  That has to be taken on board, and he was never in the mix at Bay Hill on his return, but three rounds at the Match Play will have helped speed up his recovery and he showed much better signs in all of them, particularly from tee-to-green. After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua. He can go lights out on and around the greens which is often crucial on a coastal course.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Matt Kuchar ($11,400) – It’s never fun paying this much for Kuchar at any event in my mind, but at this event, he’s definitely earned it. Kuchar has finished inside the top ten in his last three appearances at this course, and he’s now coming off of four top ten finishes in his last six starts.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

The 2014 OHL Classic winner at El Camaleon on Paspalum greens, English has putted positively across his past 3 appearances. 2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014. RESULT: T5  Kelly Kraft 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*.
English  ->  positive

He hasn't missed a cut on teh PGA Tour since the Sony Open back in January and his last five finishes have been T5, 26th, T10, T22, and T12. Digging even deeper and using the Fantasy National tool, we see that over his last 24 rounds played, Casey ranks 10th in Draftkings points, 13th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green, and 6th in Strokes Gained Approach. He comes back to the OPEN with spotty history making nine cuts in 14 attempts with just two top 10's, the latest coming in 2010.
Casey  ->  positive

Fowler’s 66.9 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks sixth in the field this week. Fowler is coming in hot, and he’s played Augusta well previously. He’s likely too cheap on both DraftKings and FanDuel and could have double-digit ownership, which Pro subscribers can review in our DFS Ownership Dashboard shortly after the Masters starts.
Fowler  ->  positive

One of this week’s matches for Levitan’s trend is Lucas Glover, who has missed three of his last four cuts. Even though he is not in great form, Glover is one of the best golfers in this field: He is tied for ninth with his 69.3 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) and third overall with his 69.4 percent LT Greens in Regulation (GIR). Lucas finished sixth and seventh at THE PLAYERS Championship and Arnold Palmer Invitational earlier this season.
Glover,  ->  positive

Without the trials and tribulations of having played at PGA National, I can see him improving on last year's 16th place finish which came immediately after travelling from Florida having played all 4 days this time last year. RESULT: T30  Joost Luiten 0.5pt EW 125/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here (6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Paul Dunne 0.5pt EW 175/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (6 places, 1/5 odds):  A couple of longer-priced European Tour players to complete the team this week.
Joost Luiten  ->  positive

That one start resulted in a 27th place finish. Matt Kuchar ($7,900) is one of the shorter hitters off the tee and hasn’t been terribly accurate on approach so far this season. Despite his struggles with the full swing, he’s ninth on tour in Scrambling.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Now, after analyzing the entire PGA Championship field, McClure has put together his optimal lineup and is sharing it over at SportsLine. One player he's all over: Hideki Matsuyama ($10,500 on DraftKings), who just won the Bridgestone Invitational. According to McClure, there is no reason to pay for anyone more expensive than Matsuyama, who has mammoth upside at a discount over players like Jordan Spieth ($12,000) and Rory McIlroy ($11,800).
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He had a rotten final round alongside Spieth and while on paper it looked a good pairing for them, I think both would be better suited to playing alongside someone who they aren’t quite so friendly with in a final round at a major. Fowler will have learnt from that though and he is driving the ball better than he ever has, currently ranking 1st in total driving. He is also 20th in GIR, 6th for strokes gained: tee to green, 1st in birdie average, 13th in bogey avoidance and 21st in scrambling.
Fowler  ->  positive

Key Statistics  These are the percentage weights I will be applying to my custom model over at Fantasynational.com.

We will play him as long as his price stays down.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

Jordan missed the cut at Riviera last year but did post a T4 here in 2015 and finish in 12th in 2014. Tee up Spieth with great confidence in all formats. Spieth currently checks in with a FantasyLabs projected ownership of 21-25 percent in large-field tournaments.
Spieth  ->  positive

Hadwin ranks T5 alongside Steele in Par 5 Performance and 18th in Strokes Gained: Putting (down from 7th last week), so statistically he ticks the boxes for this event. Billy Horschel ($8,900) – Horschel loves this course and once again if he can get hot with the putter, he will contend. He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts.
Horschel  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Further, DJ’s current form is off the charts: He won three straight tournaments before finishing in second place at last week’s Wells Fargo Championship, and he has finished no worse than third in his last five events. Johnson’s history at TPC Sawgrass is not nearly as glamorous, however: He hasn’t finished better than 28th (last year) in eight career starts in this event. Per our Trends tool, DJ has averaged 65.17 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) and generated a -0.73 Plus/Minus in his last three trips to this track.
DJ’s  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner  MY PICK : Bud Cauley ($8,000)  Cauley has accumulated four top-10 finishes in his last five starts and has quickly become a proven commodity for fantasy. While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish. In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

With a 30 man field, and some soft pricing, I’m going to give the three guys I believe you should have 100% of, and the “Others to consider” below, can fill out our lineups. With that said, Jordan Spieth is going to be a popular play without a doubt. I almost feel wrong writing him up here, but what am I going to do, not write up my pick to win this event?
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

So too could one of those two-time champions, Stewart Cink, who continues to produce results now playing with a far more relaxed attitude owing to some difficult personal circumstances. Whether Cink can convert solid play into his first win in eight years remains to be seen though and I'd rather chance Jim Herman doubling his career tally. Herman won the Shell Houston Open last year, so his missed cut in that event last time can be excused given the extra responsibilities and attention afforded to a player who is used to going about his business away from the spotlight.
Herman  ->  positive

Fowler has the necessary young man's nerve to shine on lightning-fast putting surfaces and for the third time in his career he ranked 1st in Putts Per Round at the Masters last month. As for iron play, Fowler sits a very healthy 7th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green while he's 12th in Approaches from over 200 yards. Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio.
Fowler  ->  positive

Daniel Berger(13)  ->  positive

Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
Reed,  ->  negative

Brian Gay  3. Danny Lee  MY PICK : Kevin Chappell ($9,400)  Chappell had a slow start to the season, but over the past few weeks, he has seen a big resurgence in his game. While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts.
Chappell  ->  positive

Kuchar ranks 32nd in SG:T2G, 37th in Par 4 Scoring, and 11th in Scrambling. With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Also consider: Rickie Fowler, Emiliano Grillo, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka  Lower Priced Plays:  Here is a list of the lower priced players (below $8,000) we like this week on Draftkings that will be worth rostering:  Tony Finau ($7,900)  Byeong Hun-An ($6,900)  Patrick Cantlay ($7,800)  Peter Uihlein ($6,800)  Billy Horschel ($6,700)  Marc Leishman ($6,900)  Bill Haas ($6,900)  Brendan Steele ($6,700)  Kevin Tway ($6,500)  Other DraftKings Misprices:  This is something new we wanted to include in this weeks article as we believe there are several misprices that we can capitalize on to fit in some of the higher priced players.
Kuchar.  ->  positive

He’s currently leading the PGA Tour in birdie average with just over five per round, while he’s also first in par-five scoring and second in par-four scoring. Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

Chalk Howell returns again to make us wonder what the pricing algorithm must be smoking. Brendan Steele ($8,000) – While I’m reluctant to call success on any courses played this season up to this point the least bit relevant, it’s hard to ignore just how dominant Brendan Steele has been up to this point. He comes at a significant discount over the more prestigious bombers in the field, yet appears to have every bit of the same upside and proficiency.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship. ——  Good luck, and be sure to do your own PGA research with the FantasyLabs Tools and watch our PGA videos on our Premium Content Portal.
McIlroy  ->  positive

What's really caught my eye though is Hahn's recent putting form which sees him sitting 9th in my rolling 10-week Putting Average tracker. Rounds of -5/65 and a closing -8/62 powered Hahn into a play-off in last month's Sony Open where he was outlasted by Patton Kizzire. Last week on a home Scottsdale track that he likes, James finished 11th with -4/67 and -5/66 rounds across Friday and Saturday powering the Californian through the mid-pack.
Hahn's  ->  positive

Result: WD  Charles Howell III 1.5pts EW 40/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Charles Howell III is playing some great stuff right now and despite being a 'long time between drinks' as Ian Baker-Finch put it at the Quicken Loans National, the Augusta, Georgia man is well worth following this week. 2nd in my published predictor model, since the start of season 2016/17 Charles is up 47 spots in the OWGR, now finding himself on the fringes of the all-important top 50.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

After spending the majority of the 2015/16 season out with a shoulder injury, Perez came back in strong fashion, winning the 2016 Mayakoba Classic and following that up with another win at the 2017 CIMB Classic. Perez seems to have improved as a player not only since his injury but since he’s gotten older and at 41 he still has around 10 years of PGA Tour golf ahead of him, should he stay injury-free and in decent form. Thanks largely to his Mayakoba win, the runner-up finish at the Wells Fargo and a 3rd at this event last season, Perez finished 15th in the FedEx Cup standings which is by far and away his best performance since its inauguration in 2007.
Perez  ->  positive

He’s been red hot tee-to-green, and were it not for some bizarre putting errors on his part last week, he’d have likely been in contention for the win. Valero may be tough, but Hadwin has risen to virtually every challenge he’s faced thus far, and his short game should serve him quite well here. Stewart Cink ($7,400) – Cink may have had a bad stretch for a few holes on the back nine last week, but that should not overshadow an incredibly consistent year of golf from a guy who is already known for being super consistent to begin with.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Softer conditions could favour bombers but in reality everyone is in play for the win here making this an intriguing venue for fantasy and betting purposes. Stud Picks  Bill Haas ($10,800): Haas has some tight competition at the top of the salary charts this week with Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson also playing decent golf, but Haas has been better than both recently. He recorded his best finish ever in a major at Erin Hills with a T5, and has four top 25 finishes now over his last four starts.
Haas  ->  positive

He has the potential to win numerous times on the PGA Tour and this looks to be one of the courses he can get the job done at. Webb Simpson 55/1 (Betfred 6 places ¼ odds) 1pt e/w:  One player that already has a few wins under his belt and is seemingly closing in on another is Webb Simpson. The four-time PGA Tour winner and 2012 U.S. Open champion has been in fine form over the last month, and this course suits his game.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

The South Carolina native is a Bermuda-grass stud with excellent course history here, making the cut all four times he’s played the event while picking up two top-10s his last two attempts.
Kisner  ->  positive

Spieth was a 4/1 shot, with Zach Johnson at 11/1 and Danny Lee 80/1. Looking back, Spieth was our Predictor Model Number 1 that week with a score that was 900 points higher than Zach Johnson in position 2 (Danny Lee was in 8th spot). Last year saw the Predictor highlight Ryan Moore in 5th spot at 25/1, plus Ricky Barnes (4th spot) at 125/1 which I also tipped - he finished T5.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

After him, the $8,000 range has what appears to be some good values in Xander Schauffele ($8,800), Ryan Palmer ($8,300) and former winner Brendan Steele ($8,900). Other values to consider for this format include Jamie Lovemark ($7,700), Keegan Bradley ($7,900), Kevin Streelman ($7,700), Jason Kokrak ($7,400) and Kevin Tway ($7,000). Tournaments — This is a weaker field, so going under $7K doesn’t look very appealing, although if you select the right golfer (as we saw with last week’s RBC winner) you can potentially gain a huge advantage.
Kevin Streelman ($7,700), Jason Kokrak ($7,400) and Kevin Tway  ->  positive

When you pair that with his eight top-15’s at Bay Hill in 12 career starts, Rose becomes a foolproof option this week. Tiger Woods, $11900 – Tiger’s resurgence the last two weeks has gotten golf plenty of good PR, but this week it may hit even higher levels at the storied Bay Hill, where Tiger has dramatically won on many occasions. Given Tiger’s great course management the last couple weeks, he appears to be in great shape to post a third straight top-10 finish.
Tiger  ->  positive

Given the health issues surrounding the fickle Mr. Stenson, our second and third best options are without question Rickie and Sergio (not necessarily in that order) with the perfect combination of length and precision to dismantle this golf course at reasonable prices. Russell Knox ($7,500) – Bethpage Black simply isn’t a fit for a guy like Knox, but I would argue that TPC Boston most definitely is. Knox’s Achilles heel has always been the putter, but frankly, he’s been putting exceptionally and this course is all about tee-to-green anyway.
Knox  ->  positive

To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68. As only the ninth most expensive player in the field this week I think Chappell represents good/great DraftKings value and like an NBA player banking in his 3-pointer at the buzzer I am even calling for him to pick up his first PGA Tour victory here, too. MY SLEEPER : John Peterson ($6,900)  John Peterson has proven himself to an interesting character in his few years out on tour.
Chappell  ->  positive

As per usual in Texas, wind should be a factor throughout the tournament with a steady breeze likely reaching 10-15mph each day. Past Champions    2017 - Kevin Chappell  2016 - Charley Hoffman  2015 - Jimmy Walker  2014 - Steven Bowditch  2013 - Martin Laird  2012 - Ben Curtis  2011 - Brendan Steele  2010 - Adam Scott    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Charley Hoffman - $16,200    Prior to a T40 at last year’s edition of this event, the 2016 Valero Texas Open champion had finished no worse than T13 in seven consecutive appearances at TPC San Antonio. Hoffman is known to excel in the state of Texas, while the 41-year-old has also notched four top-25s in his last six starts.
Martin Laird  ->  positive

A performance that would lift a player above the seemingly numerous legitimate contenders at the front of the market. At the Houston Open, Jordan Spieth provided it. Spieth's record at Augusta National is extraordinary.
Spieth  ->  positive

Again, I don't think we need to pay up at the top in cash games but he has a ton of upside and makes an excellent GPP play. Ryan Palmer  World Golf Ranking (#99)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($9,300)  It's been a long road for Palmer who not only had to deal with offseason surgery but personally had to deal with his wife's breast cancer diagnosis. He has been up and down in 2018 but has made three of fours cuts with the high being a T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Here are my selections for the 2017 Sony Open. Pat Perez 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w  Pat Perez at 40/1 is one of those picks I struggle to make, but also find terribly difficult to ignore. Perez returned to action last October at the CIMB Classic and finished T33.

Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour. But of all the options available, Cink seems to be the best bet to make the cut.
Stewart Cink  ->  negative

The PGA Tour heads for West Virginia this week where New Zealand’s Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic over The Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs. Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic this week against a field that includes Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Four places in The Open Championship are available to the top finishers who are not already exempt for Royal Birkdale.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

How do you avoid Haas when he’s gained 40 strokes on the field at this event in the last 5 years?” Well, it’s because those strokes were gained on the front end of that five-year term and Haas has shown none of that ability recently. Haas is the epitome of a plodder. It’s as if he’s developed an allergy in the last couple of years to birdies and eagles.
Haas  ->  negative

So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

The Georgia native is also enjoying a great start to the year statistically, as he’s currently ranked much higher in important categories like Strokes Gained: Putting, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and Strokes Gained: Approaches than he was in 2016, and also comes in at sixth for the year in Bogey Avoidance. Henley missed the cut at this event last year but he’s played well at similar venues in the past and has played well in Florida over his career too. Well rested and under the radar in a weaker field, Henley’s in a great spot to post his first big finish of 2017.
Henley  ->  positive

Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.
Spieth,  ->  positive

With just one PGA Tour win to his name, betting him at 40/1 in this strength of field may raise a few eyebrows, but I fully believe Reavie can get his second PGA Tour victory this week. So far, in the 36 rounds he has played this season, Reavie ranks 5th in SG: Tee-To-Green, 8th in SG: Approach-The-Green and 5th in SG: Total. Specifically important to this week, Reavie ranks 6th in Scrambling, 22nd in Greens in Regulation and 23rd in Ball Striking (10th in Driving Accuracy).
Reavie  ->  positive

DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Matt Kuchar ($11,400) – It’s never fun paying this much for Kuchar at any event in my mind, but at this event, he’s definitely earned it. Kuchar has finished inside the top ten in his last three appearances at this course, and he’s now coming off of four top ten finishes in his last six starts. He may not generally be much of a scorer, but if you shorten up the course so that he can hit those long irons comfortably into reachable Par 5s, he can do some serious damage.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Don't worry too much about the tee time your fancy has been dealt on Friday. After a largely disappointing season, Harold Varner III has caught fire in the nick of time, I wrote about the in-form American last week and he put in a fine performance once more to finish 20th and keep his FedEx Cup journey going. His optimism continues and there's no reason to desert him now...        Patrick Cantlay is a popular pick this week, and indeed every week lately.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

With the weather expected to be bad again this week, Scrambling (SC) ability will be important, and Poston has a 68.6 percent Recent SC rate. Per our Trends tool, golfers with similar Recent SC stats have exceeded salary-based expectations:  With his consistent cut-making Poston is an intriguing FanDuel option for Rounds 3-4. Bud Cauley  Last year Cauley tied for fourth at the Byron Nelson after a yearlong break due to labrum replacement surgery.
Poston  ->  positive

Smith is also 8-under on 43 attempts from outside 200 yards, 2-under from the rough (T-18) and great at both one-putting and scoring in general. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Steve Stricker  The old man still likes to come over to the PGA Tour from time to time when he's not crushing his competition on the Champions Tour, where he has finished second and first in his past two starts. Stricker still makes his way down to Copperhead, as it is a perfect course for his game, as he has made a career of being one of the most accurate players on tour ... who happens to hit a lot of greens and can still putt as well.
Stricker  ->  positive

However, Brandon Grace has a history of going back to South Africa in December and playing throughout December and strong into January. Over the last five years, Grace has started out the new year with a 2nd and a 7th at the Volvo Golf Champions on the European Tour. Last year, he took 4th at the BMW South African Open which led into a strong desert swing with a victory in Qatar and a 5th in Abu Dhabi.
Grace  ->  positive

Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
Lunde  ->  negative

One similar player, however, may be flying under the radar in his flat-brimmed hat: Kevin Chappell. Prior to missing the cut at the Quicken Loans National, Chappell had ripped off nine straight made cuts, with a win at the Texas Open, a top-10 at the Masters, and a top-five finish at the St. Jude Classic included. He is tied for 36th in this elite field with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score.
Chappell.  ->  positive

Statistically Fowler ranks 49th in Strokes Gained Off-The-Tee and 14th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green which are two of the key areas this week. Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season.
Fowler  ->  positive

Brendan Steele $7,900 – One last West Coast swing event means our next two guys are trying to rack up as many FedEx cups as possible. Steele is a California guy who putts best on POA versus other green surfaces. His form is fantastic coming off a T3 at Waste Management and loads of T20s and T30s prior.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Mr. Spieth If You’re Nasty  Jordan Spieth ($11,500) is the only other player in the field with odds to win greater than 10 percent this week: He’s currently at 11.1 percent. Spieth’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score and 17.0 LT Adj Bird Avg are both second this week. Spieth has been lights out to start 2017, winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and accumulating two third-place as well as ninth- and 22nd-place finishes.
Spieth  ->  positive

While he hasn’t been outstanding at Glen Abbey, his game has also come a long way in just a year, and if fairways are optional, you need Finau on your squads. MID TIER  Ben Martin ($8,200) – Martin had a pretty rocky finish at the Greenbrier, but he rallied straight back at the Barbasol with a very nice T6 finish. He has been absolutely on-point with his T2G game, and although he got destroyed here last year, I expect him to extend his made cut streak to ten this week with big upside.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
William McGirt  ->  negative

Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass. Stanley has a spot secured in the Open next weekend but my gut tells me this guy still grinds it out this week regardless to fine tune. Danny Lee ($9,200) – Danny Lee has been on fire since the Players posting 4 top 10’s since then.
Stanley  ->  positive

Looking at recent play, he's finished top 5 in four of his last six worldwide starts. Cameron Smith ($7,600): The Aussie is red-hot, worldwide. Going to ride the hot hand and play this youngster.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
Rory McIlroy  ->  negative

Essentially, Cauley looked to have the world at his feet and went close on a number of occasions straight out of college, but injuries and a loss of confidence then seriously hampered what promised to be an exceptional career. However, a Web.com Tour win a couple of years ago signalled a return to where he belongs and Cauley went close in last year’s Byron Nelson before threatening to win again at the start of this year, eventually finishing third in the CareerBuilder Challenge. A return to the east coast since that effort in California is a definite positive and I was on Cauley at a big price when he finished 27th in the Honda last time, when hanging around on the fringes of contention all week.
Cauley  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Charley Hoffman 25/1 1pt EW  Brendan Steele 28/1 0.5pts EW  Adam Hadwin 33/1 0.5pts EW  Luke List 50/1 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Follow me on Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Statswise he ranks third in driving distance, 36th in GIR, seventh in par 3 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. List has played here twice before with his best finish coming last year where he posted T29.
Luke List  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley also presents well for front-runners. Last but hardly least, defending champion and course thoroughbred Russell Henley is right there for the taking. The problem with him is that gamers in pursuit will gobble him up, so league leaders can do the same, play defense and won't miss him.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

A look at the course would be beneficial though, given the tough nature of the course and event. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title. Finau ranks highly in multiple areas this season, including top-25 in SG: Approach, Par-3 Scoring Average and Par-5 Scoring Average, all key areas this week.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

With the forecast looking very ominous for the Thursday PM draw, we went full AM stack for cash (in my case, full AM stack for literally everything) and it worked out beautifully with the exception of a few very disappointing finishes by Kim, Stanley, and Smith. Otherwise, we pretty much ran the table at the top of the leaderboard in terms of AM plays minus the weekly Jon Rahm show which continues to baffle and amaze at any track not named Sawgrass. Regardless, hopefully this week was a lesson to those who chose to ignore the “wind drama” and deploy their plays as though it were business as usual.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations. Now we head to another course with an easy pack of par 5s.
Luke List…  ->  positive

9. Webb Simpson -- Simpson has been making cuts but doing nothing particularly great. However, he is a horse-for-course here, like buddy Bubba Watson.
Simpson  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Travelers Championship. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week, because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
Dustin Johnson  ->  negative

Instead, I'm keen to further explore the idea that having ties with the event and its organisers might unearth a big-priced winner, as it has in the past. The standout option here is Ryan Palmer, a proud Texan who, while yet to win in his home state, has so often raised his game, especially so as he matures. Palmer has six top-10 finishes in his last 10 starts in Texas, including when seventh here in 2014, and more than most he'd love to land this title in the final year of Shell sponsorship.
Ryan Palmer,  ->  positive

Those finishes at Jack's Tournament were in Ohio and Gary has also played well in New Jersey and New York at The Barclays tournament where he finished 2nd at Liberty National in 2013 and 4th at the very classical Bethpage Black last August. Within the top 13 of this week's published Predictor Model, despite a lack of recent form you get the feeling that Woodland won't be at this kind of price for much longer, especially as he sits at 47th in the Official Golf World Rankings and will not want to leave the top table of world golf. RESULT: 4th  Watch these tips on YouTube with Steve Bamford: Golf Betting System YouTube Channel
Woodland  ->  positive

Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events. Paul Casey ($10,200) – People looking at Casey’s recent history here (43rd, MC) will be turned off, but he’s posted 13th and 5th place finishes previously at Colonial. When we’re targeting accurate ball-strikers, Casey pops to the top of our list.
Casey  ->  positive

At the Honda Classic, his short-game was nice and sharp only for the putter to again cost him ground but despite this persistent issue his form figures are improving week-to-week, and a course which is so demanding from tee-to-green and plays to his big-hitting strengths may prompt another step forward. Holmes is best served by a tricky but not impossible par 72 like this one and is selected on the grounds that both his current and course form are a shade better than they appear, while his ability to win puts him ahead of several others in the same sort of price bracket. He could threaten a place putting badly and it's in the hope that a few weeks off have helped him find something that the Kentucky native gets the vote.
Holmes  ->  positive

Looking back at the final scores over the past few years we see some dramatic changes. Last year it was Vaughn Taylor winning with a -17, the year before Snedeker won with a -22 score but in 2014, with howling winds and some rain on Sunday, we seen Jimmy Walker win with a -11 winning score. I am expecting this week to be somewhere closer to 2014 as Pebble Beach has been receiving rain since the weekend and it's expected to continue through Friday.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Justin Rose (5): Been quiet recently but a T12 at the BMW PGA Championship was a nice sign that his game is still there. =SUPER SUBS=  Steve Stricker, Brandt Snedeker, Francesco Molinari, Webb Simpson      Group C  Brooks Koepka (6): Has played a busy schedule since the Masters and for good reason. His game is trending well and he's never backed down from a USGA setup, posting T18 or better in his last three U.S. Open appearances.
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

With the way things have been going for the rookie, I would have no issues running him out in cash games this week and is definitely in play for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Moreover, Casey has been playing well lately: Prior to his 26th-place finish at the U.S. Open, Casey had finished 12th or better in three of four tournaments and hadn’t finished worse than 22nd. Casey is tied for second in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score, and his 14.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks 10th overall. ——  Be sure to watch/listen to the PGA Daily Fantasy Flex podcast coming soon.
Casey  ->  positive

In his last stroke-play start, Pieters finished T38 in Mexico, but he got the week off to a much better start than the result suggests, opening with rounds of 69-68, sitting T14 with eventual winner, Phil Mickelson. Of course he struggled over the weekend, shooting 74-72 to fall 24 places, however his play over the first two days here, after finishing T13 at the Honda Classic suggest he’s playing ok. PGA National is not a course you’d think would suit Pieters so that was a very promising result and whilst he disappointed at the Match Play last week, I think he can re-energise himself here. A T4 finish on debut at Augusta last year suggests Pieters could well like this test as well, and will be looking for confidence-building week as he returns to Augusta looking to emulate that success from 12 months ago.
Pieters  ->  positive

Andrew Loupe  3. Wyndham Clark  MY PICK : Russell Henley ($9,300)  Henley has been up or down for the most part since his win earlier in the year at the Shell Houston Open, but I wouldn’t let a few wild rounds put me off him here. He was in contention and striking it great at Erin Hills after three rounds, and he also put in two solid rounds of 67 last week on a very difficult course.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

I love Donald Ross' design. I think he's somewhat of a genius in terms of architecture and I've always enjoyed his golf courses, Donald confirmed. "The greens are very true, very fast, quite undulating.
Donald  ->  positive

Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section. I’ve been having a lot of success with more balanced lineups and I think this is another great week to stay the course there.
Varner  ->  positive

36th in Total Eagles, 50th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 72nd in par-4 and 81st in par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion are statistics I really like for Coco Beach and it's worth remembering that Blixt has contended at the highest level across The Masters (2nd 2014) and PGA Championship 4th (2013) in the past. There have been signs this year of better times ahead - 5th at Torrey Pines after 54 holes, 11th after shooting 64 in Round 2 at TPC Scottsdale - and Blixt has certainly re-invigorated his top notch putting in recent appearances. His CV stacks up well when it comes to correlating course form - 1st CordeValle (2012), 3rd TPC Summerlin (2012), 1st Old White TPC (2013) - and he's picked up some strong finishes very recently at coastal classics Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he finished 6th and 3rd only last year.
Blixt  ->  positive

I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.
Bubba Watson  ->  negative

Most recently, Steele played well at the Masters finishing in a respectable T27 and followed that with a T6 at the Players Championship and a T13 last week at the US Open. Steele is another player with a decent record here finishing T13 in 2011, T13 in 2013, T5 in 2014, T25 in 2015 and a T17 last year. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Steele  ->  positive

Given how high the ownership will be on both Finau and Steele, using Greg Owen in a stars & scrubs format will help ease the ownership burden, with lots of upside to score well on DraftKings. Owen made the cut last year and finished T65, and in 2010 finished T41. His current form isn’t the prettiest, but if he can get a putt to drop he’ll be in great shape.
Greg Owen  ->  positive

8. Rickie Fowler, United States -- Not only did Rickie squander a chance to win The Barclays by fading down the stretch to tie for seventh, he played himself out of an automatic spot on the United States Ryder Cup team. Now he has until Sept. 12 to convince Davis Love to make him one of four captain's picks and he can start this week when he defends his title in the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Rickie  ->  positive

Silverman missed the cut last week, but before that had been 3-for-3 in cuts, including a T7 at the Sanderson. So we're banking on that skillset carrying him this week in his tournament debut. Ben Silverman - $7,000 (Field, 5-1)  Another rookie, Silverman is ranked T19 in proximity, 25th in strokes gained approach and 47th in strokes gained putting.
Silverman  ->  positive

Here are how the last five winners of this event ranked in Par-5 Scoring and SG: Putting the week they won, as well as their Florida form that season. P5 Scoring SG: Putting Florida Form  Marc Leishman (2017) 2nd 2nd T27 (Honda Classic)  Jason Day (2016) T5 6th N/A  Matt Every (2015) T16 8th T63 (Honda Classic)  Matt Every (2014) T15 3rd T24 (Honda) T8 (Tampa)  Tiger Woods (2013) 1st 1st T37 (Honda), Win (WGC)  Market Leaders  Tiger Woods (13/2)  Jason Day (12/1)  Justin Rose (14/1)  Rory McIlroy (20/1)  Rickie Fowler (20/1)  Selections  Brian Harman 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Brian Harman has been playing exceptionally well this season, much like last season and his T5 finish at the WGC in Mexico was further evidence of that. It is very easy to see why Harman is playing well, just by taking a quick look at his stats.
Harman  ->  positive

He's a big price at 250/1 or so having offered one or two glimpses towards the end of 2017 that his game might be coming around. A lengthy shortlist also throws up Ollie Schniederjans, who almost won at a classical course last August and will be off the mark sooner rather than later, and Daniel Berger, another Floridian who just needs to show that he doesn't require tougher conditions to compete. However, I'm turning to a pair of class acts who might find that this is an ideal place to turn things around, starting with Russell Knox.
Daniel Berger,  ->  positive

It would be extremely daft to write him off but others are preferred at the prices and the one I really like is last week's winner, Hideki Matsuyama. When Matsuyama hits form he tends to stay in form and with course form figures reading an improving 38-20-11, he looks the most solid of the market leaders. Dave Tindall has made a solid case for him here and I couldn't agree more.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  positive

The Las Vegas man is one of those who tends to generate results over and over again on his favourite courses and with confidence high I can see him right in the mix this week. RESULT: 2nd, Lost Play-Off  Scott Stallings 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Jhonattan Vegas won this last year after leading the Barbasol Championship after both 36 and 54 holes the week before in Alabama.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Kevin Chappell  World Golf Ranking (28)  Vegas Odds (23/1)  Draftkings ($10,200)  FantasyAces ($5,700)  The large majority of my core lineups this week are going to built around Kevin Chappell. Sure he isn't coming into the week with fantastic form(T35, T45) this fall but a closer look paints a different picture.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

With the U.S. Open nearing and a Muirfield Village course that he likes ahead this week, a fourth win of the season is on tap. Johnson finished third at the Memorial last year prior to his U.S. Open triumph at Oakmont.-- Bob Harig  Value picks  Kevin Tway  I think a lot of people will shy away from Tway in this field, but I don't think that's the route we should go. When looking at his past three performances (not finishing places) he's gaining over a stroke from tee-to-green as well as gaining almost a stroke on the greens.
Johnson  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason. Before his 60th-place finish at TPC Sawgrass, Fowler had finishes of 4th, 1st, 16th, 12th, 3rd, and 11th (Zurich team play notwithstanding). To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well.
Fowler  ->  positive

He's made the weekend in all eight appearances at Deere Run, with five top 25s and three top 10s, but treat him like a wild card. American Family Insurance Championship - Round One Michael Cohen  Expert Picks  Kyle Stanley  Charley Hoffman  Brian Harman  Danny Lee  Daniel Berger  Steve Stricker  Chad Campbell  Kevin Kisner  Johnson Wagner  Charles Howell III  Expert Explanation: For the Model to not pick Stricker is a travesty on par with Forrest Gump winning the Oscar over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction.

All things considered, Rory is my top fantasy pick of the week and safe in all formats. Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)  FanDuel ($10,900)  Ranked even higher in my overall model(#1) is Paul Casey as he is the only player in the field who ranks Top 10 in all four categories on my sheet(stats, history, form & DK average last 5). It starts with the course history as Casey has now finished 6th or better in three straight Masters appearances and for his career has made eight of 11 cuts with five Top 10 finishes.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel -- Alex Cejka ($8,300)  From Ryan Moore to Charley Hoffman to Scott Piercy, there are a handful of Vegas residents in this week's field, but my pick is the guy who was part of the runner-up logjam at this event last year. Cejka had a decent finish at the CIMB Classic two weeks ago and he should be accustomed to desert golf.
Alex Cejka  ->  positive

Now that the event follows the Open Championship, the majority of marquee names take the week off and the big names in attendance tend to be associated with the sponsors, RBC. World number one Dustin Johnson and last week's runner-up, Mat Kuchar, currently ranked 12th in the world, are the standout names this year and now that Brandt Snedeker has been forced to withdraw, Charley Hoffman, who ranks 38, is the only other player in the field inside the top-40 of the world rankings. Venue  Glen Abbey Golf Course, Oakville, Ontario      Course Details  Par 72, 7,253 yards  2016 Stroke Index - 72.54  Glen Abbey was the first course Jack Nicklaus designed on his own and it opened for business in 1976.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

It would appear therefore that he is the sort of player who takes a momentum on to the next week and if he can do that here, when returning to a venue he has improved at every year, he could well surprise at a big price. ZACH JOHNSON – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 10 Finished 36th  The final place in this years team goes to another former Masters Champion in the form of Zach Johnson. Zach is winless since his memorable victory at St Andrews in 2015, however there have been signs since the end of last year that he is getting back on track.
Zach Johnson.  ->  positive

Holmes has only failed to make the weekend once at Riviera, but that came in 2013 - the year he suffered terribly with ankle and elbow injuries which limited him to just five PGA Tour starts, four of which resulted in missed cuts. Second in strokes-gained: tee-to-green here in 2016, Holmes is fancied to go well if able to return to the form he showed at Torrey Pines. Given his record both at Riviera and in California as a whole, there's every chance he can do that and the fact that he became a dad over Christmas is another little factor which may explain his effort at Torrey, and hopefully inspire a similar one here.
Holmes  ->  positive

Sorry, Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott will get his wish and Hogan will spin again, as he did when Scott won the Masters with the long putter, when caddies started reading greens via a map and when players started failing to show up for Friday tee-times after shooting Thursday 77s. Wood: I definitely think it is an easier setup in terms of fairway width and lack of penal rough around the greens.
Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott  ->  negative

WilliamHill 6 places 1/5 odds) 2pts e/w:  Jordan Spieth has not had his best season so far, but the fact we are saying that is a testament to the lofty expectations placed on him by both us and himself. Before winning at Pebble Beach in February, Spieth started the season T3-3-T9, but it his play since that has raised question marks. He has missed three cuts in the nine events since his win and also failed to make it out of his group at the WGC Match Play.
Spieth  ->  positive

He is 20/1 because of the pure strength of the top of the market this week, but that’s big enough for me, considering his record here and wonderful current form. Hideki Matsuyama 40/1 (BetStars 5 places) 35/1 (Bet365 8 places, Boylesports and WilliamHill 7 places) 1pt e/w:  Hideki Matsuyama has been incredibly solid at Augusta over the last three years, finishing 5th, 7th and most recently 11th and he can go even better this week. After withdrawing from the Phoenix Open earlier this year with a wrist injury, Matsuyama made a return at Bay Hill, but could only finish T49.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

However, in terms of crafting a winning strategy, it is going to be essential to have the winner on your roster this week. Since the winner is probably going to be one of the elite stars (Johnson, Spieth, etc. ), you will more than likely need to utilize a "stars and scrubs" methodology this week when building your teams.
Spieth,  ->  positive

DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Kim t-71st)    Andy Sullivan– Last year in this very same spot, I wrote this about the Englishman- “Shhhhhhhhhhh, don’t look now, but there’s another Brit who is in fine form at the moment and could take home golf’s next major championship trophy. Danny Willett shocked the world at the Masters, and don’t be surprised whatsoever if his fellow countryman Andy Sullivan does the same this week at Royal Troon. His form has been steadily peaking throughout the season, most recently finishing t-5th at the French Open and t-6th at last week’s Scottish Open.
Andy Sullivan–  ->  positive

I think he is now motivated after the Ryder Cup to become a perennial top player week in and week out. Taras Pitra -- William McGirt ($8,700)  McGirt has the course history working in his favor this week as he's only missed one cut in five appearances. McGirt's strengths are primarily from tee to green, which should play well here.
McGirt  ->  positive

Wagner  ->  positive

He has not missed a cut in his last 13 PGA starts. MY PICK : Peter Uihlein ($8,800)  Uihlein is an American golfer who played the Euro Tour regularly for several years with decent success. The former top-ranked amateur golfer in the world decided to make the move back home this year, however, and did it in style by winning the first Web.com playoff event (about a month ago) and securing his PGA card for this season.
Uihlein  ->  positive

There is also little difference in the Thursday-Friday forecast at this point, so one wave likely won’t have a huge advantage over another, although checking the forecast again Wednesday night is always recommended! MY PICK : Justin Rose ($10,200)  Rose is an interesting play this week, so much so that I think it makes sense to pair him with one of the top-three priced golfers, as there are enough lower-salaried golfers to fill out lineups with. Rose started the season much earlier than usual this year at the Sony Open, and he responded with his best finish ever there with a lone 2nd.
Rose  ->  positive

Obviously, it's concerning to see any player struggle so badly but the slightly faster surfaces of Riviera may well help and he's certainly better suited by the layout of the golf course, having been third, sixth, seventh, eighth, 11th and 12th here since his 2006 debut. Holmes has only failed to make the weekend once at Riviera, but that came in 2013 - the year he suffered terribly with ankle and elbow injuries which limited him to just five PGA Tour starts, four of which resulted in missed cuts. Second in strokes-gained: tee-to-green here in 2016, Holmes is fancied to go well if able to return to the form he showed at Torrey Pines.
Holmes  ->  positive

Berger  ->  positive

He’s bounced back nicely after a spring slump, and he’s fifth on Tour in SGT2G the past five events. Haas has excelled with his iron play and scrambling, both of which are keys this week. Haas has two top-5 finishes in five attempts at this venue, and I expect more of the same this week.
Haas  ->  positive

Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup. Bradley did win the WGC-Bridgestone event in 2012, but despite a bunch of top-5 and top-10 finishes since, he has failed to record another PGA Tour victory. Before that last win, he had the chance to kick off 2012 in style, but Bill Haas ruined that here, beating both Bradley and his 2012 Ryder Cup partner, Phil Mickelson.
Bradley  ->  positive

Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago. Campbell has made seven of his last eight cuts with no finish worse than 34th. The field has caught on as Campbell has regularly been on of the highest owned options in cash his last 2 events.
Campbell  ->  positive

His last victory came here in 2014 so if he's going to win again, Harbour Town is as likely a place as any but he too looks short enough to me. Cameron Smith was superb last week, finishing tied for fifth in his second US Masters. He's played here twice before, finishing 15th and 29th and if Augusta has taken it out of him, he's the value towards the head of the market.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

And we all know he should have won (or at least made the playoff) at the PGA Championship there if not for a bogus ruling in a bunker on the final hole. Steals  Francesco Molinari ($7,800)  This is a crazy low price for Molinari, who has been on a tear recently. He ranks 1st in my statistical model, mostly thanks to his incredible ball-striking the past few months.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

*EW Terms: 1/5 Odds | 7 Places      Patrick Reed's career has already encapsulated some huge highs, but the proud American has still not lived up to his bold early career claim that he's among the best five players in the game. Reed has improved his year-end ranking each and every year he's been a pro, but he's going to need a very special end to 2017 if he's to better last year's final ranking of eighth (he's currently dropped to 25th). Despite the rankings drop, Reed is insistent he's currently playing better than last season - he's been in the top 25 in eight of his last 11 events; he was fourth on his Bridgestone debut in 2014, and 15th the year after.
Reed's  ->  positive

As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out!

Luke List  ->  positive

Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well. Jordan Spieth ($10800): After a week where the talk was Dustin Johnson’s (almost) triumphant return to the links, it’s easy for most to forget just how good Jordan Spieth actually is. Although he won’t go under the radar in terms of ownership (by any stretch), it’s important to reiterate his talents that translate to this course:  1 st in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach T1 in Bogey Avoidance  2 nd in Birdie or Better %  in Birdie or Better % 5th in Par-4 Scoring  Although the flat stick hasn’t been up to his typical world-beating standards, Spieth still sits 31st in SG: Putting, and his poor ranking for putts made inside 10-15’ is easily explained by small sample size.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

If he is to do so, it will likely be on a shorter, tougher, championship style layout like the Copperhead course at Innisbrook. Simpson’s last four opening rounds on bermuda greens have been 67-67-69-66 and he opened with a 67 here last year. Simpson will be teeing off at 08:07 on Thursday morning so will therefore get the best of the greens, something he should hopefully relish given his current form with the putter.
Simpson’s  ->  positive

In two starts at Conway Farms, Rose has finished 33rd (2013) and 13th (2015) and I expect him to better both results this week. When finishing 13th in 2015, Rose ranked 6th in SG: Approach and 9th in SG: Tee-to-Green so he struck the ball extremely well and it was just his short game that let him down that week. Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending.
Rose  ->  positive

Made sure everyone on this squad had a little bit of positive history here at TPC Scottsdale. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 361.5  Last Week Rank: 3471  Hideki Matsuyama ($33,300)  Zach Johnson ($23,900)  Andrew Landry ($13,800)  Austin Cook ($13,200)  Harris English ($8,700)  John Huh ($7,100)    Analysis: A great mix of course history, current form, and long-term talent. Landry is a good mid-tier option that will likely get overlooked this week.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

I won't have exposure in cash games but I love it from a GPP standpoint as he is likely under owned. Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports  Russell Henley (DK $7,100 / FD $5,200 / Odds 90-1)  Henley sits at the same +14 as Steele on FanDuel but it's a tick lower on DraftKings at +6. Either way, I think there is value here as Henley ranks 14th on the sheet in SG: OTT, 5th in SG: Putt, 25th in BoB%, 16th in Par 4 scoring, and 8th in Bog Avoidance.
Henley  ->  positive

49th last week on his Bay Hill debut and 21st at PGA National was a decent haul across his first ever Florida swing, but many will remember the 26 year-old San Diego State University graduate for his eye-catching performances 'out west' where he landed 9th on his old home course at Torrey Pines and a brilliant 4th at TPC Scottsdale. Results such as those at 2 of the PGA Tour's premier tournaments highlight a player who's well ahead of many in this field and Spaun is undoubtedly on a fast track as he's already ranked 118th in the OWGR. Statistically J.J. sits 21st in Total Eagles, 72nd in Birdie or Better Conversion, 95th in par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion and 30th in Going for the Green Birdie or Better season-to-date skill categories.
J.J.  ->  positive

Shrink the sample size to eight rounds and Streelman ranks 5th in Par 5 scoring and 12th SG: OTT. Throw in his course history of 3-for-3 in made cuts and Streelman turns into a highly viable cash game option. Martin Laird, $8000– The old tall, Scottish golfer comes into the Valero in decent form and continues to have success at tracks that he hasn’t fared well at in in the past.
Streelman  ->  positive

He’s got an excellent Par-4 Scoring number of 4.02 and an even better Par-3 number of 2.97, and has the distance to score on the par-5s here when few others will be able to. Thomas Pieters ($7700) – There may be some bias in this pick, so tread lightly, but the Belgian checks a lot of boxes:  Long off the tee? Pieters is currently averaging 294 yards (on 24 measured drives) on the PGA Tour, but is averaging 309 on the European Tour.
Pieters  ->  positive

RESULT: T29  Chris Kirk 1pt EW 60/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Chris Kirk is another who fits the bill very well this week. A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

A lover of soft, scorable golf courses, he was 6th here last term - going out in the final group with Dufner and Hadwin. Lovemark seems the sort, who struggles to get over the line, but undoubtedly he strings form together well and he's 15th for Total Birdies season to date, after hitting another 2 eagles and 18 birdies at Waialae. For Brendan Steele this is a home game and I was impressed with him last time out at Kapalua.
Lovemark  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Anirban Lahiri ($7,500)  If one of the lesser salaried players is going to take down the title this week it will have to be someone who can pour in a ton of birdies; especially since the top of this field is stacked with great names. Enter Lahiri, who is currently ranked fourth in Birdie Average, ninth in Birdie or Better Percentage and 16th in par four Birdie or Better Percentage. In short, Lahiri can pile up the DK points fast when he’s on and looks like he’ll be a great fit for a course which is typically one of the most lenient on tour in terms of scoring.
Lahiri  ->  positive

We went back and forth between Spieth and Dustin Johnson, but ultimately Spieth's superior putting made our decision for us. Tier 2 Values    Marc Leishman - $9,000 (20-1)    A big man with great touch, Leishman was one of the hottest guys going from the playoffs into the fall season. After winning the BMW Championship, he lost to Thomas in a playoff in South Korea and then tied for fourth at the Australian PGA in early December.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

He's yet to win on the PGA Tour but it looks only a matter of time before he gets off the mark and this looks like an ideal opportunity. Rahm has ranked number one for Birdie Average on the PGA Tour over the last six months (averaging an impressive 4.62) and this set-up looks absolutely perfect for such a talented and aggressive birdie machine. Rahm may be playing the event for the first time but his new caddie, Adam Hayes, knows the venue well.
Rahm  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

However the wrap-around season can clearly help to re-balance the equation with Brian earning 3 pay cheques across 3 outings. 4th on his beloved Bermudagrass greens at the Sanderson Farms Championship was powered by 18 birdies (8th best in the field) and Stuard was also in the mix last week in Las Vegas where a Saturday round of -2/69 placed the Fort Worth, Texas resident into 10th spot come Sunday. 4th in my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker and 18th in the embryonic PGA Tour ball-striking category, Brian is playing some great stuff from tee-to-green right now and that could be perfect as he arrives at a course where he has finished runner-up twice in both 2011 and 2013, placing in the top 10 for Putts per Round on both occasions.
Brian  ->  positive

In fact, it was the easiest of the 50 courses played on the PGA Tour last year. And like last year, the wind is forecast to be fairly benign, especially for an oceanside course, so scoring could approach Spieth's near-record of 30-under. Key Stats to Winning at Kapalua    • Driving distance  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling  • One-putt percentage (putts per GIR)    Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy  2009 - Geoff Ogilvy  2008 - Daniel Chopra  2007 - Vijay Singh    Champion's Profile    When we see 400-plus-yard drives, it's only natural to think this course favors the biggest hitters.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Reavie has a habit of holding his form, he's currently inside the top-25 ranked players on poa annua and he ranks third for Par 4 performance on the PGA Tour and 12th for GIR, so he looks like a great statistical fit. Lowry hasn't set the world alight on the PGA Tour this year, with a missed cut at Torrey Pines and a 65th placed-finish in the Phoenix Open on Sunday, but he's a great links exponent and poa annua putter and he was in-form before Christmas. His tournament form figures read 21-41-14 and I thought he was just worth chancing at [95.0]    Selections:  Chez Reavie @ [75.0]  Shane Lowry @ [95.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with my ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth preview.
Lowry  ->  positive

Similar comments apply to Chris Wood, whose swing changes are presumably still bedding in, while Paul Dunne has not been playing well and Jim Furyk is no good thing to build on a closing 66 in the Valspar Championship. That rather rudimentary process of elimination leaves Patrick Rodgers, and he goes alongside Piercy in the staking plan at 22/1. Rodgers has recovered from illness to produce one of the most consistent spells in his fledgling career, bagging five cheques in succession, two courtesy of top-10 finishes, including a season's-best seventh last week.
Rodgers,  ->  positive

TYLER DUNCAN – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  I mentioned earlier in the preview that this event has graced the Web.com tour for the past two seasons and Duncan is one player who has tee’d it up in both renewals. In those two outings Duncan has finished 33rd in 2016 and 3rd in 2017 and in eight rounds on the course his worst performance is 70. Clearly therefore Tyler has enjoyed his time in the Dominican Republic.
Duncan  ->  positive

He also has 4 straight top 15’s here at TPC Sawgrass. Jordan Spieth ($10,800) – Anytime I can roster Spieth at lower ownership, I will take full advantage. He has 2 straight MC at TPC Sawgrass which should keep his ownership lower than what it should be at.

-- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons. I would not roster Kirk in cash games, but for GPP purposes his ownership will be extremely low.
Kirk  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  You get the feeling that Rickie Fowler means business right now. 2017 saw Fowler play second fiddle to his Jupiter, Florida comrades Dustin Johnson (World Number 1), Brooks Koepka (World Number 8) and Justin Thomas (World Number 3) who between them amassed 11 victories last year including the U.S. Open, PGA Championship and 2 World Golf Championships. You can throw in a FedEx Cup title for good measure as well.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Considering the confidence he is entering with, seeing Fowler figure out the Plantation greens this year wouldn’t be shocking, and his course history suggests that even a slight improvement in this area could mean a win in the first event of 2018. My Sleeper: Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000)  DeChambeau will be making his first appearance at this event after winning the John Deere Classic late in the 2017 season. Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts.

With so much doubt, I'm going with chalk and taking the best player, one who has already proved he can win this title. Johnson recently told me he really likes the challenge of playing tough golf courses and grinding out pars. That's enough to earn my pick.
Johnson  ->  positive

Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price.
Leishman  ->  positive

1pt each-way Kyle Stanley at 33/1 Sky Bet (6 places; 1/4 odds) A course record of 49-MC-62-MC is moderate but the most important factor for Stanley is confidence with the putter and that seems to be coming. Ranked 2nd on tour for GIRs and 12th in scoring average, he has the long game and results are starting to come with three top-10s since the start of April.
Stanley  ->  positive

Okay, he lost 2.284 strokes on the field last week when it came to the flatstick but, prior to that, gained 3.077 at the Travelers so it's not all doom and gloom and there are some positive signs. It's time to add some course form and Bradley has that having finished fourth here in 2014 after shooting 67-69-71-66. The Ryder Cup star was also 11th going into the final round in 2012 and in the 2015 event, the last to be played here, he closed with a 64 to finish T29th.
Bradley  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Johnson sealed his third win in consecutive starts when taking the title 12 months ago and already ranked World No.1 at the time, whilst Day was also coming off the back of a win at the Arnold Palmer and was ranked 2nd in the world before his win here in 2016 took him to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings. With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years.
Day  ->  positive

There’s going to be a lot to discuss given the field size and depth, so let’s jump right in. Previous 5 Winners:  2016: Dustin Johnson (-6)  2015: Shane Lowry (-11)  2014: Rory McIlroy (-15)  2013: Tiger Woods (-15)  2012: Keegan Bradley (-13)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Proximity Par 4 Scoring GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Jon Rahm ($9,700)  Rahm is the highest priced player I’ll be discussing this week. Now, that doesn’t mean I’m not interested in anyone priced higher.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas.
Fowler  ->  positive

Ironically, he also ranks ninth in birdies from the fairway and is also the only player who shows up in the top 10 of both lists. Scott has also historically been great here: an 11th, second, and 10th in his last three attempts here. Here’s hoping Scott snaps out of his funk at a familiar place.
Scott  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Patrick Cantlay.  ->  positive

Roll with him when you just need a cut-maker for cash game purposes. Best bargain basement option  Trey Mullinax $6.500 – News flash…Trey can BOMB the golf ball! He was one of the biggest hitters on the Web.com Tour last year.

Our man takes a detailed look at this week's PGA Tour event, where Dustin Johnson is a warm favourite to retain his title. Read our man's in-depth preview ahead of Thursday's start here...  “In-form Chez Reavie and Tommy Fleetwood, who should take to the track, were both on the radar but I felt they were both fractionally short so my four are Kevin Streelman, Charl Schwartzel, William McGirt and KJ Choi.”  Tournament History  The PGA Tour moves 300 odd miles down the Californian coast from Pebble Beach to Los Angeles for the final tournament of this year's West Coast Swing - the Genesis Open. In existence since 1926, and originally known as the Los Angeles Open, the Genesis Open often attracts the best field on the West Coast Swing and with three of the world's top-four in attendance, along with Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, we have another strong renewal to look forward to.
William McGirt  ->  positive

😯 https://t.co/CbmNc6XCsX — Brendan Porath (@BrendanPorath) March 20, 2018  Group 5 Hideki Matsuyama  Patrick Cantlay  Cameron Smith  Yusaku Miyazoto A fairly difficult group to assess, with top seed Hideki Matsuyama having only made his return from injury last week and the other three all making their debuts in the event. Cameron Smith's form has just dipped slightly so it's Patrick Cantlay who rates the biggest danger to Matsuyama, as he certainly has the game and the temperament to thrive in the format. Indeed, with Matsuyama's long-game extremely rusty at Bay Hill, it would be the consistent Cantlay who gets the vote to advance and as he's seeded to face Tyrrell Hatton in the last-16, the Californian is worth backing at prices around the 50/1 mark.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen has gone very close at Augusta National All of Oosthuizen's best play in the Masters has been powered by his customary tee-to-green quality and in the hope that a return to this course sparks a return to his best, he looks worth backing at around the 66/1 mark. Here at Augusta, he lost a 2012 play-off to Bubba Watson and after struggling to put that behind him a year later, has since built up a solid bank of form with three top-25 finishes in four and no further missed cuts.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Daniel Berger makes his belated debut at Firestone having withdrawn on the eve of the tournament twelve months ago and on paper it is a course that should suit him. At Firestone you need to drive it long and relatively straight, which is fine for Berger who ranks 37th for strokes gained off the tee. He also arrives on a run of form that reads 1-MC-2-5-27.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

1pt each-way Chez Reavie at 66/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) Well rested since, this is a great opportunity for Reavie to gain his second tour win. His last four tournaments have produced finishes of 48-4-16-43 and he was in the top-10 going into the final round of the Travelers.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

1st for Greens in Regulation, 3rd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green and 6th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green at Kapalua carried on Brian's ball-striking prowess from the autumn. Tie that in with the fact that Harman has found the greens here to his liking on recent visits placing 3rd for Strokes Gained Putting last year and within the top 10 in 2016 and you can see that he has a real chance this week to deliver a much merited win. It's worth remembering that the St Simons Island resident won his maiden title with a -22/262 total at the 2014 John Deere Classic so low scoring is no chore and on a track where Greens in Regulation and Bogey Avoidance is critical, he currently sits 4th and 10th across both PGA Tour skill sets.
Brian's  ->  positive

Stud Picks  Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Spieth gets the nod over Dustin Johnson this week for me. Both have won on Poa grass this year but Spieth seems the better fit for a new course with apparently very tricky greens and a layout where power off the tee might not matter much. For all Spieth has done he’s actually never won a WGC event so the motivation to get that in his trophy case is there as well, as is the desire to catch DJ in the OWGR.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Golfers in this price range with LT metrics comparable to Castro’s have historically generated a +3.42 Plus/Minus on DraftKings with 56.8 percent Consistency. #SeaIslandMafia underboss Zach Johnson is 18th in the field with a 66.9 percent LT DA. Johnson’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score is third, his 14.1 Adj Bird Avg ranks sixth, and his 28.6 LT Putts Per Round — a large part of Kisner’s win last year — is fifth.
Johnson  ->  positive

DJ is #1 in the world in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, and that formula should give him a decent shot at a position somewhere near the top of this leaderboard. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – A missed cut at the Genesis Open may keep some away and make Matsuyama under-owned. Just a couple of days past his 25th birthday, he still has his best golf in front of him, impressive for someone with two wins already this season.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b).

Justin Rose  ->  negative

Looks like a good time to jump back on. Dustin Johnson – $11,400  Similar to the Justin Thomas situation, DJ was going through the motions at the BMW Championship, taking a semi week off, looking ahead to East Lake. DJ is another golfer who can win the FedEx Cup with win this week.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Brian Harman ($11,500) may be the hottest golfer on the planet right now: He’s finished no worse than fourth in his two tournaments in 2018 and he hasn’t finished outside of the top 10 in his last five tournaments. Harman is also Hump’s pick to win, which means he’ll likely shoot an 85 on Thursday and withdraw from the tournament. Harman is tied for 10th with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score, while his 67.6 Recent Adj Rd Score and 79.2 Recent GIR percentage both lead the field among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks.
Harman  ->  positive

He comes to the fore on mid-score (-11 to -17) level tournaments and at 7th in the Team USA Ryder Cup standings, a win this week would pretty much lock his place on the flight to Paris in September - which on form over the last 10 months you have to say he merits. RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

As with DJ, the encouragement for that comes from looking at this year's Bogey Avoidance stats where Fowler is ranked 4th (he makes one on just over 10% of his holes). Other very Augusta-friendly Strokes Gained stats from Fowler are 9th in Putting, 4th Tee-To-Green, 24th Driving Distance, 3rd Approach-The-Green, 1st Scoring Average, 1st Sand Save Percentage (nearly 80%) and 3rd Scrambling. If he can bring all those parts of his game to Augusta, he must have a golden chance of landing his first major.
Fowler  ->  positive

Indeed, in terms of world ranking points, 10 of his best 20 finishes have come either a week before, a week after or during the week of a major championship, so the timing of the Travelers is ideal for him. Cauley has looked on the verge of an overdue breakthrough for some time now and a ball-striker's golf course like this one, with so many of the big names vulnerable, represents a serious opportunity. Posted at 1215 BST on 20/06/17.
Cauley  ->  positive

A second win at Waialae came in January - a course which links well through to Bay Hill champions Ernie Els, Matt Every and Marc Leishman. Then on his last outing, at WGC-level in Mexico, Kizzire finished with a -5/66 to jump into 12th spot and again grab a decent haul of OWGR + FedEx Cup points. Now into March, he still ranks 2nd in the FedEx Cup points standings, 51st in the OWGR and 12th in the Ryder Cup standings for Team America.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Kiradech Aphibarnrat 2 points @ 4-1 (Lads)  Russell Henley 2 points @ 4-1 (BetVictor and others)  Daniel Berger 2 points @ 7-2 (General)  Ryan Moore 2 points @ 4-1 (Lads)  Ian Poulter 2 points @ 5-2 (Lads)  **all top-20**  Apart from the excellent previews here on @thegolffamily, you’ll read tens of articles on the one event that towers over any in terms of historical trends – and I’m not about to argue with any of them. ADVERTISEMENT  Any perusal of the stats and profiles of winners comes up with the same conclusion and it’s a matter of interpreting them one way or another, but even looking at them in the most obtuse fashion, the same players come up again and again. Splitting the top ten or so in terms of winning, or at least contending, is too tough for me and whilst my own preference is for Bubba Watson to prove just too inventive for the rest, it is impossible to deny the claims of those around him in the market.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

He is a bomber who putts well and although he can be a little wild, we get a huge break in pricing versus his odds to win the event allowing us to use him early this week. Erik Dantoft: Brandon Hagy ($8,300) (FanDuel, rounds 1 and 2)  Hagy is an ideal round 1-2 golfer this week on FanDuel. His inexpensive salary allows you to spend up for a top tier round 3-4 golfer, but more importantly, Hagy is in a great position to score you some early round 1-2 fantasy points with the likelihood of adding some finishing points at the end of the tournament as well.
Brandon Hagy  ->  positive

Chappell confesses to feeling comfortable at Bay Hill, where his relentless ball-striking and love for a demanding test is rewarded, and he did very little wrong here when second to Day in 2016, leading the field in strokes-gained tee-to-green as we've come to expect. Video element not supported Kevin Chappell makes an ace at the API  Throw in finishes of 14th and 24th, the latter on debut six years ago, plus second in the PLAYERS, second at Jack's place in the Memorial and second to McIlroy in the TOUR Championship, and it's clear that there's a lot in favour of a player who tends to produce his best golf against the very best. Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state. Piller has been wildly inconsistent on the PGA Tour, despite being a six-time winner on the Web.com Tour, one of which came last year to help secure his PGA Tour card this season.
Piller  ->  positive

It is worth remembering Chappell’s strong showing at the FedEx Cup play-offs, finishing 2nd at the season-ending Tour Championship and 8th at the Deutsche Bank Championship, proving he has plenty of game, on the biggest of stages. John Peterson 200/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  I put Peterson up for the other event in his home state, the Shell Houston Open, just for him to withdraw before the off, but I like chances that bit more here, at the same price. Last week, Peterson turned up to the RBC Heritage off the back of some travelling issues and a weekend in Vegas, but this time the father-to-be looks to be in better focus.
John Peterson  ->  positive

Whilst the PGA players read the script in Hawaii, the less said the better about South Africa, where the impressive Chris Paisley won his maiden very easily from local and tournament fav Branden Grace. It really does feel as though events other than the select top few are open to any player these days and anyone following a group of youngsters over a cliff really shouldn’t be giving up any time soon, clearly at any price.

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 4 Winners:  2016: Justin Thomas (-23)  2015: Justin Thomas (-26)  2014: Ryan Moore (-17)  2013: Ryan Moore (-14)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Par 4 Scoring Fairways Hit GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Justin Thomas ($12,300)  Who else to begin with the two-time defending Champion, Justin Thomas? JT is now the 4th ranked golfer in the world, and it’s largely in part to his terrific summer where he enjoyed a pair of wins at the PGA Championship and Dell Technologies Championship, before a 2nd place finish at the TOUR Championship to earn him the FedEx Cup Title.
JT  ->  positive

But I also like McGirt as his 69-68 across the weekend in Las Vegas was good enough for tied 5th in the field - level with Cantlay and Hadley - plus his CV contains plenty of excellent performances by the coast. A steady hand on the tiller might be just what's needed this week on the eastern seaboard and McGirt fits that bill perfectly. RESULT: T8  Beau Hossler 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
McGirt  ->  positive

If he keeps up the same pace of improvement here, the Green Jacket is his and regardless of whether that looks likely or not, there is no denying his suitability with the course. Henley was defending his title at the Houston Open last week and whilst he was quiet on Friday and Saturday, Henley played well on Thursday (69) and Sunday (65) to finish a respectable T8, perfect preparation once again for this week. He will need to improve in keeping bogeys off his card, never ranking higher than 16th in that department in the three starts he’s made the weekend, but now making his fifth start at Augusta, he should have a better understanding of how to do just that.
Henley  ->  positive

18+, T&Cs apply:  I'm always preaching patience so let's stick with Jhonattan Vegas for a further week on a course where he has a habit of playing well. As I noted last week, Vegas has certainly turned a corner of late and that's best highlighted by the fact that he only conceded 4 bogeys at PGA West last week, beaten only by Andrew Landry. That will stand him in very good stead this week on a course where the talented Venezuelan has finished 3rd (2011 on debut), 11th (2015), 18th (2016) and 28th (2017).
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

In terms of correlating course form, Simpson has results everywhere you want to see them and it's also good to see that he has excellent Champion Bermudagrass results across both TPC Southwind (3rd 2014) and Sedgefield Country Club (5th 2014, 6th 2015, 3rd 2017). RESULT: T21  Tony Finau 1.5pts EW 45/1 with £/€20 risk-free bet* for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (8 EW, 1/5 odds):  Big names at the top of the betting have created bigger prices for some form players and I like the look of Tony Finau this week. On a course where length, power and a strong scrambling game are required, Finau looks a good shout this week, especially as the birdies are flowing of late.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo – $9,000  He is becoming a staple near the top of the leaderboard, but I do not see myself owning Grillo this week. For one, I like so many of the other golfers around Grillo, and find myself gravitating towards them. I think he will be very popular due to his recent form.
Grillo  ->  negative

He has made five of his past six cuts, finishing as high as 10th at Pebble Peach. Fade - Zach Johnson (77K): Like Taylor, Johnson doesn't match the course at all. The key difference: Johnson costs triple the salary.
Zach Johnson  ->  negative

As you'd expect a mix of players and circumstances across 3 different courses, but all had at least a top 16 finish in one of their previous 2 outings which differs significantly from the incoming form characteristics if you look purely at the Valero Open winners. My selections are as follows:  Billy Horschel 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Billy Horschel arrives in San Antonio with momentum and we know that he likes playing in Texas.

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one.
Reed  ->  positive

Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
Mickelson  ->  negative

Selections:  Si Woo Kim @ [70.0]  Russell Knox @ [80.0]  Brian Stuard @ [140.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter There are a number of players at huge prices that I could easily fall for but I'm going to leave it at three for now. Russell Knox found some form at a venue he likes last week and I've also chanced Brian Stuard again after his tied ninth alongside the Scotsman in Mexico but that'll do me before the off.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

He is second on the European Tour in GIR and he's even 18th in putting, the weakest part of his game. Tier 2 Values    Justin Rose - $9,600 (20-1)    Rose has three top-4s in four starts this year, including tournaments played at Torrey Pines and Riviera. He's a horrid 164th in driving accuracy, but still is fifth in strokes gained tee-to-green.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Much like Chez Reavie with solid recent performances I would expect Bradley to be cash chalk and feel that this is well deserved. Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times.
Reavie  ->  positive

This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day. He doesn’t have the best results at Muirfield, but it seems as though Day has found his old form.
Spieth  ->  positive

At a venue and time of year when he's very much in his comfort zone, it would be no surprise to see Snedeker sprint out of the blocks and take an early place at the top of the leaderboard. Spieth, by the way, has opened with a 66 on both his starts in this event. In 2014, it gave him the first-round lead and last year's Thursday seven-under left him second.
Spieth,  ->  positive

I think he’s a better fit for this course than his results dictate and like him to contend, if not win, this week. MY SLEEPER : Kyle Stanley ($6,000)  Stanley is off to a nice start in 2017 with four of five made cuts and three top-25 finishes or better. This has mostly been off the back of some solid ball-striking too as he currently ranks eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 14th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and is also averaging over 300 yards per drive in 2017.
Stanley  ->  positive

He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s. Martin hasn’t missed a cut since the RBC Heritage in April, including a T5 at the Quicken Loans National and racked up 21 birdies at The Barbasol Championship last week in route to a T6 finish. Just below the average price on DraftKings means Martin will be a lock for us in all formats.
Martin  ->  positive

Bill Haas at 40/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - consistent type is better equipped than most to deal with course switch  0.5pt e.w. Patrick Rodgers at 200/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - T2 in the 2015 renewal and worth chancing to bounce back to form  0.5pt e.w. Smylie Kaufman at 500/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - speculative but better on last solo start and may surprise  1pt e.w.
Patrick Rodgers  ->  positive

After a good start to the season and a solid performance last year, Snedeker looks a good shout here. Pat Perez 45/1  The American is playing great golf at present with a win and two top 10’s in his last four starts. He started the season with a respectable T33 at The CIMB Classic and followed that with an impressive T7 at The Shriners Open in Vegas where he shot rounds of 66,66,69,68 to finish 15 under par in total.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. This week’s OWGR chart has some very interesting standouts this week, one of whom is Wesley Bryan who’s official world golf ranking is 40th in the world despite his sub $7k price tag. Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place.

The UK and Ireland challenge is both historically and recently strong so I thought I'd look at the various nationality markets, starting with the Top English. The Olympic Champion and 2013 US Open winner, Justin Rose, is the strong and rightful favourite to finish the week as the Top English player at Erin Hills and after his incredibly sporting reaction to his defeat at the US Masters in a playoff to Sergio Garcia, few would begrudge the understated and charming 36-year-old. Rose knows what's required - plenty of patience and a calm demeanour - and he should love the course.
Justin Rose,  ->  positive

Count on him to tear it up here even at this price with plenty of shots at those nice FantasyDraft birdie streak bonuses. Hudson Swafford ($15,300, Cash or GPP) – The Swafficer has been one of my absolute favorites over the past year. Why?
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

Brooks Koepka, $8600 – The recent U.S. Open breakthrough followed by a month-long hiatus and subsequent tie for 6th at the Open Championship is a worthy trend heading into another high-profile event. Koepka withdrew from last year’s WGC-Bridgestone with an ankle injury, but prior to that in 2015 was sixth at Firestone. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Marc Leishman, $6500 – Leishman is top-20 in both par-4 scoring average and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, so this week aligns well with his strengths.
Koepka,  ->  positive

At this price point, Kisner makes for a quality core play. Also Consider: Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, J.B. Holmes  Dark Horse:  Lucas Glover ($8,600) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact.
Glover  ->  positive

European Tour's Race to Dubai returns this week on Page 3.

Ancer should be comfortable with the culture and language spoke on the property this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68. As only the ninth most expensive player in the field this week I think Chappell represents good/great DraftKings value and like an NBA player banking in his 3-pointer at the buzzer I am even calling for him to pick up his first PGA Tour victory here, too. MY SLEEPER : John Peterson ($6,900)  John Peterson has proven himself to an interesting character in his few years out on tour.
Chappell  ->  positive

Selections  Brian Harman 16/1 (UniBet & 888 – 6 places 1/5 odds) 2 pts e/w:  He may be the second favourite in the field, and it may not be the most original pick but Harman looks almost impossible to leave out this week. Twelve months ago Harman finished 3rd here, a year after finishing 11th, so it is clear he has found a liking for this event. Adding to his recent event form, Harman also finished 8th at Q-School when it was hosted here in 2011 so it is fair to say he has an affinity with the setup here.
Harman  ->  positive

Spieth is certainly in that camp and despite all of the top 6 in the FedEx Cup standings having legitimate chances in Georgia this week, I think the World Number 2 has all of the tools he needs at his disposal to capture the FEC title for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. When asked in Chicago what he likes about East Lake, Spieth replied: "East Lake and Augusta remind me a lot of each other. You have a really well designed golf course where the fairways slope against the ball flight that you need off the tee and then the greens remind me of each other with the slope, the speed and the bunkering around them.
Spieth  ->  positive

Load up and don’t look back. Paul Casey ($9,900) – Casey is coming into the Wells Fargo Championship in great form. He has played excellent golf lately and it should continue this week.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson 28/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson has not won since the 2013 Open Championship and that is an obvious concern, but where better to get back on track than TPC Scottsdale. Mickelson is a three-time winner here and has shot the course record (60) twice, so it is clear he loves the place. Unlike Torrey Pines (where he had struggled in recent years), Mickelson has still kept up his form here.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price.
Leishman  ->  positive

He makes great salary relief for DJ, and could find himself with a top-25 this week. John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards).
DJ,  ->  positive

Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Brooks Koepka  He came agonizingly close to winning last year, eventually losing to Sergio Garcia in a playoff, but Koepka returns to a favored track with form in his favor. He's finished 16th or better in each of his last four starts, which means this week should be the perfect marriage of course experience and recent performance.
Koepka  ->  positive

Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri. Wont see high ownership but there are much better pivots on the board.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  negative

Basically, I'm looking for a big hitter with a win this year who is coming in off a top 20 at Firestone. Step forward Kevin Chappell. The 31-year-old scored his maiden victory in April's Valero Texas Open and has since posted T4 at St. Jude, T8 in Canada two weeks ago and T13 in the WGC-Bridgestone where he carded 67-68-69 over the final three rounds.
Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

According to his PGA TOUR profile, he also resides in Scottsdale. Ranking the Field I've been slow to jump on the Harkins train since his Web.com Tour results weren't anything to drool over. However, it's impossible to keep ignoring his torrid form.
Harkins  ->  positive

Outright Bets to Win  Brian Harman 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  JJ Spaun 65/1  First Round Leader  Jon Rahm 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chez Reavie 50/1  Brian Stuard 75/1  Sam Saunders 120/1  Doubles  Jon Rahm 8/1  Brian Harman 15/1  Kevin Kisner 20/1  Patton Kizzire 30/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  Euro  Dustin Johnson 5/1  Rory Mcilroy 7/1  Justin Rose 8/1  Branden Grace 22/1  Tommy Fleetwood 40/1 We'll touch on those at the end. We'll just get right to it with the first tip, the La Quinta Course is the Easiest of the 3 so we should target guys that tee off early on this course first on Thurs for the First Round Leader bets.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

The left-hander was a big eye-catcher in Boston, where the long game and the short game worked in harmony for sixth place - his best strokeplay finish since last year's second place at the Open Championship. Mickelson spoke afterwards of some real off-course struggles this year, including severe fatigue, but says he's on the right track now and relieved to finally get rewarded for his hard work. Statistically, Mickelson was really close to his absolute best last time and despite a stop-start season, he yet again ranks inside the PGA Tour's top 20 in birdie average.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

MY PICK : Russell Henley ($8,300)  There are a lot of interesting plays at the top this week in a stronger than expected field, but for DFS my main pick is going to be more of a value play. Russell Henley has played outstanding golf almost all season, with an early season equipment change doing wonders for his approach game specifically. Henley has always been good off the tee and on the greens, but his new found efficiency is pushing him towards the top of the tour in many other stats as well.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

He’s a great value this week. Wesley Bryan ($7,500) – Bryan’s exceptional performances recently at both Riviera and PGA National warrant some reasonable attention this week as he will be on a course where his particular skill set should very much come in handy regardless of his lack of length. If his tee-to-green game is on point, Bryan is dangerous around and on the greens, and he could be an excellent value pick this week.
Bryan  ->  positive

Indeed, he's no bigger for any of the four majors, yet here he does not have to beat the very best and nor does he have to prove that the course fits, because in six visits he's made five cuts, twice contending for the title, while even last year's 12th place included a third-round 65. Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson.
Fowler  ->  positive

He has a great course history (runner-up last weekend, his third showing of T20 or better). His game is perfectly suited to putting up huge fantasy numbers (his 13 birdies last weekend for his T49 finish was only one birdie back of Adam Scott, who finished 38 spots higher on the leaderboard). He’s been inside the top 20 five times in his last six starts, the kind of consistency you like to see before you trust him in a cash game, which means he is now a viable candidate in any format contest.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

Russell Knox ($7,800) might not be all that intriguing with the names surrounding him, but he is well suited for Harbour Town. Knox has shown that he can play here as he has made the cut in all four of his attempts here with two Top-10s and no finishes outside of the Top-20. It feels as though everyone has completely forgotten about Knox, but this course history cannot be ignored.
Knox  ->  positive

7th (2013) and 1st at East Lake (2014) across an elite-class field also shows that Horschel likes the rigours of a Donald Ross test. Success here at Sedgefield had been limited with a 30th, 46th, 47th and a MC from 4 appearances until 12 months ago when Horschel off of the back of some indifferent non-Bermuda form, very reminiscent to what we are seeing from him at the moment, finished 5th. Naturally with a Floridian upbringing, this Bermudagrass narrative makes plenty of sense and in this season alone, Horschel has finished 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and 4th at TPC Southwind, with Bermudagrass making up 3 of his 4 top 5 finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend.
Fowler  ->  positive

Like Hoffman, Steven Bowditch, Martin Laird, Brendan Steele and Adam Scott are all capable of getting it out there off the tee, making the 2012 victory of Ben Curtis all the more hard to fathom and, for form study purposes, worth treating with caution. All of this serves to whittle down those at the head of the market, where Matt Kuchar is easy to oppose after a staying-on but never-threatening 11th on arguably more suitable terrain last week, and clear preference is for Brooks Koepka at anything around the 25/1 mark. Having signed off 2016 in the form of his life, which included an impressive Ryder Cup debut, it’s been a difficult start to 2017 for Koepka, one of the many Nike-branded players who now have licence to experiment with their equipment.
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

Who the Stats Like  Keegan Bradley  World Golf Ranking (#70)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,600)  FanDuel ($9,600)    For my first stats pick this week I wanted to not only find a player who stands out on my sheet(mix of this year and last year stats ranks) but also a player who has been trending recently. Enter Keegan Bradley who is #11 in my stats model as he ranks 2nd overall in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking(7th in OTT, 5th in APP), 16th in Good Drive %, 16th in Proximity, and 15th in Par 4 Scoring. His only knock with my key stats are Par 5 Scoring and Birdie or Better %(can be attributed to his brutal putting).
Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

He’s coming off a missed cut at the BMW PGA across the pond, but finished 2nd in China, 2nd in the WGC Mexico, and 1st back in January in Abu Dhabi; all of these events had strong fields, and his top-10 finish at the Arnold Palmer has shown he can compete in tough fields stateside as well. Phil Mickelson ($7700): On a course where scrambling and second shots matter, Phil is priced far too cheaply for his upside; it’s a given that he’ll end up in some odd spots off the tee from week to week, but Lefty is consistently one of the best around the greens (currently 25th in SG: ARG) and has been throughout his career. Mickelson has struggled to get through four full rounds this year, whether it’s from mental lapses or physical exhaustion (he’s old), so that will be a concern – but he’s also 24th in Approach shots, an elite putter who puts up a ton of DK points with his great birdie average, and he’s 10th in scoring on Par-5s.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

At 100/1 I really like Berger’s chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard, as he looks to add a second PGA Tour title in as many years. Branden Grace 100/1 (SkyBet 1/4 7 Places) 0.5pt e/w:  The South African is one of those players that you would have expected to have a much better record here at TPC Sawgrass, especially given his record on Pete Dye Courses. Grace has a great record at Harbour Town with a win, a 7th and an 11th place finish to his name there, and also finished 3rd at the 2015 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

After a solid performance in Sedgefield last week Sneds is certainly worth a second look here. Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend.
Grace  ->  positive

ALEX CEJKA – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 NON RUNNER - WITHDREW BEFORE START  In a second division event played on Papsalum greens Cejka always has to come in to the conversation. A proven winner on the European Tour Cejka decided to relocate and take up life on the PGA Tour in the early 2000s and after many years of toil he was finally rewarded with a victory at the Puerto Rico Open in 2015. This victory of course makes Cejka of interest in this event due to the obvious course correlations previously noted.
ALEX CEJKA  ->  positive

Last year it averaged 4.31. Market Leaders  Justin Rose has been knocking at the door of late, with a fifth-place finish at the Valspar Championship and a third in the Arnold Palmer, but his form here is only ordinary, reading 52-14-37-15 and I suspect his participation is based on how good a prep the event has been for him for the US Masters. He didn't play here in 2016 when he finished only 10th at Augusta but after his 37th in 2015 and his 15th last year, he went on to finish second in the Masters.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

This time he has been much more consistent, finishing T14 at Torrey before his T16 last week, so I am full of confidence once again, that Mickelson can get his first win since the 2013 Open Championship. Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here.
Reed  ->  positive

Lovemark hasn’t had the best of seasons but he doesn’t look far away, and playing alongside a partner who can get up and down from anywhere and is so easy to get along with should guarantee that he’s fully focused for this return to the scene of his standout PGA Tour performance. Seung-hul Noh impressed when winning the Zurich Classic three years ago and is interesting alongside An, who was second on his sole visit, beaten in the same play-off as Lovemark. You can rest assured An in particular will be fired up given his recent war-of-words with two less-able American players concerning the world rankings, but Noh will take some carrying on recent form and that’s enough to put me off.
Lovemark.  ->  positive

Given his ranking of 16th in Strokes Gained: Putting in the early going this year, he’s a good bet to be in the mix Sunday afternoon. Russell Henley, $9,800 – Henley out-birdied Tim Clark for his first PGA Tour win at Waialae back in 2013, and since has notched a couple more top-17s, proving his win wasn’t a fluke. Henley is a strong fit for this venue given his strong balance of distance and accuracy off the tee combined with solid putting.
Russell Henley,  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour. Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar.
Grillo  ->  positive

Staking Plan  Rickie Fowler 1pt 16/1 each way (33/1 antepost)  Jon Rahm 1pt 18/1 each way (66/1 antepost)  Tommy Fleetwood 1pt 25/1 each way (66/1 antepost)  Padraig Harrington 1pt 66/1 each way (129/1 antepost)  Alex Noren 1pt 50/1 each way  Marc Leishman 1pt 50/1 each way Leishman, who is fourth for scoring average on the PGA Tour, merits strong consideration at 50/1 each way. His last start was a tie for fifth at the Quicken Loans National and has finished no worse than 34th in his last six tournaments.
Noren  ->  positive

With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices.
Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7 Justin Rose  ->  positive

4. Patrick Reed, United States -- The new FedEx Cup points leader after his fifth career victory last week in The Barclays, Reed will make his fourth start in the Deutsche Bank Championship and last year's was his best. He played the middle rounds in 67-67 and finished in a tie for fourth, although he was seven strokes behind winner Rickie Fowler.
Reed,  ->  positive

However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
Hatton  ->  negative

England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years.
Ian Poulter,  ->  positive

Russell Henley ($7100) : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor.
Henley  ->  positive

The very early 80/1 in the market has rightfully been snapped up, but with the price history of this event 66/1 with HV3 is not a bad place to be this week. A European Tour winner back in December at the Australian PGA Championship, played on Bermudagrass greens at RACV Royal Pines Resort on the Gold Coast, Varner has had a slow start to 2017, but that changed at Bay Hill where the Jacksonville Beach, Florida resident contended for 54 holes - he was 8th after Round 1 and 11th after Round 3 - before understandably going backwards in the final round when paired with Paul Casey who shot 78 to Varner's 77. That final round aside, Harold only leaked 5 bogeys over the opening 54 holes and that's a green light for me as he has the power-bomber game to really compete on his debut at Coco Beach (I really wanted him to play here last year).
Varner  ->  positive

The Spaniard shot to worldwide fame at Oakland Hills in 1999 and among his other major championship near-misses came third place at Pinehurst, perhaps the most famous entry in the Donald Ross portfolio. Given that he probably putts best on bermuda greens and has shown definite improvement across the last two FedEx Cup events, Garcia is both playing well enough and suitably under-the-radar to put his experience to use at a course which is always capable of catching out the fearless aggression of youth. Since his last start here in 2014, Garcia has really stepped up a level and he's been winning in high-class company.
Garcia  ->  positive

Where immediate course form is not a must to win The Players, course experience is still an advantage, but one that seems to be waning just a little in recent times. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Ben Martin and David Lingmerth (a Sawgrass member) have contended and placed across the last 4 renewals and Henrik Stenson finished 3rd on course debut back in 2006. Hal Sutton (1983) and Craig Perks (2002) won here on course debut, but that was in an age when The Players was scheduled a couple of weeks before Augusta.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

The latter is a better player who has won more titles both this year and all told, who knows how to close out majors, and Fowler's links preparation shouldn't see them priced next to each other. We are talking here about an exceptional player in Fowler, but an all-time great in the making in Spieth. Players like him don't come along often.
Spieth.  ->  positive

Casey offers some solid cash relief off of the top guys and definitely has shown he can contend with the best in the world. Don’t be shocked if Paul Casey ends up lifting the FedEx Cup trophy come Sunday. Si Woo Kim – $6,700  Since I believe stars and scrubs will be a popular approach to building lineups this week, I think Si Woo Kim will be one of the least popular golfers in the sub $7K range.
Casey  ->  positive

Scott has always been a player who, once confident, can perform at a high level for a prolonged period of time. Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best.
Scott  ->  positive

Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
Furyk  ->  negative

I also like his tournament history, where he is riding three consecutive Top 20s with a sixth place here last year. Kokrak ranks well in several of the tools on our website, which usually means good things. At $7,700 I think he presents us value in cash games, but also will be a lower owned GPP play as well this week.
Kokrak  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay  Ben Coley provides a group-by-group guide to the WGC-Match Play Championship, with three each-way bets recommended. Group 1 Dustin Johnson  Kevin Kisner  Adam Hadwin  Bernd Wiesberger The draw for the defending champion could hardly have been kinder. Of the players in Pool B, few have been struggling as badly as Kevin Kisner of late - the fact that these struggles have taken place on courses so well suited to his game is particularly disconcerting.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama won in Phoenix for the second year running, Jordan Spieth justified favouritism with a dominant victory at Pebble Beach and the trend could continue with another short-priced winner at Riviera. Having watched two of his rivals in the world's top five post a win, Dustin Johnson may feel it's his turn and this looks a perfect venue for the big-hitting American to join the party. DJ had a 10-footer at 18 to win this tournament two years ago.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices. My mind goes back to Augusta Sunday when Justin Rose was in the middle of the 13th fairway with a 2-shot lead and Sergio Garcia was taking a penalty drop.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

I also like Moore's Donald Ross record which includes his win here, 2nd at East Lake last term, 3rd at East Lake (2012) and 2nd at Aronimink behind Justin Rose in 2010. 13th last week on a course which was far too long, Moore tied Louis Oosthuizen for least bogeys (10), and was 5th for Greens in Regulation so he's ready for a title challenge. Number 1 selection in this week's Published Predictor Model.
Moore's  ->  positive

He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events. Unlike Campbell, List is a bomber: His 309.8-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) ranks seventh in this field, and he made the cut here in his only appearance (2013). List has missed four of his last five cuts, but he finished 17th at the St. Jude Classic.
List  ->  positive

While distance off the tee perhaps isn’t as significant a stat as the first two, it’s still something to consider here as winners have averaged higher in Driving Distance and Strokes Gained: Off the Tee than at other venues (on a whole). Four of the last five winners (Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Scott Stallings and Tiger Woods) all ranked within the top 50 in Driving Distance in the year of their win. Finding Values  Odds to win are one factor to think about when picking players (but not the only thing, so be careful putting too much weight on them).
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

He's the odds-on favorite to win this week and I can understand why. Statistically, Fowler has looked superb this year, ranking 4th in scrambling and gaining almost a stroke per round (over the last six weeks) from the strokes gained around the green. As we highlighted above, that metric combined with a hot putter will inevitably put Fowler in the top 10, with a chance to win come Sunday.
Fowler  ->  positive

I think he picks up his second PGA title this week, and biggest win of his career. MY SLEEPER : Ian Poulter ($6,600)  Poulter is an easy person to overlook this week in DFS given the quality of THE PLAYERS field, but at $6,600 he makes for the perfect likely low-owned tournament target. The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

2 years ago he also led this tournament after 54 holes at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club which is only an hour's drive up Interstate 66. A final round 77 did for him that day as Troy Merritt took the victory, but with a Presidents Cup spot his if he finishes 2017 strongly and with plenty of top-level finishes across big tournaments under his belt since then, I think Chappell makes plenty of sense this week. Result: MC  David Lingmerth 1.5pts EW 33/1 with NEW OFFER!
Chappell  ->  positive

All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event. Matt Kuchar – All Formats – DK: $7200 FD: $7500  Every Major Kuchar finds himself with a mid 7k price tag on DraftKings and every Major he seems incredibly underpriced.
Stenson  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned. Spieth has played Pebble Beach five times, finishing 22nd, 4th, 7th, 21st, and 1st a year ago.
Spieth  ->  positive

He’ll be lower than 5% owned easily in GPP’s. Player to avoid:  Dustin Johnson $12,200 – Dustin Johnson is our fade due to price, value, and recent form to an extent. DJ’s losing strokes on the field in his last 3 events and at $800 more than Kuchar…it’s the percentage play to us.
Dustin Johnson  ->  negative

Scott is sniffing close to another win and has a chance to become the fifth golfer to win this event twice. Brian Harman - If you’re looking for a real longshot, you can find Brian Harman with odds of +8000. Harman wasn’t great last week at the Genesis Open, but he does have five top-25 finishes in 10 events and has made the cut seven times.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

He is nice play on both sites but especially on FanDuel under $8K. Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports Peter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY Sports  Nick Watney (DK - $7,900, FD - $7,000)  Watney had some spotty history here early in his career but rebounded nicely with a T13 and T27 finishes in 2012 and 2013. He returns in 2017 with some nice form having made seven straight cuts.
Watney  ->  positive

Francesco Molinari - $6,800 (80-1)    As a member of the PGA Tour this season, the Italian has 12 top-25s in 17 starts and sits an impressive second in strokes gained approach, third in tee to green. Molinari is eighth in driving accuracy, and usually you have to be a real short hitter to rank so high. But he's middle of the pack at 104th in distance off the tee.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

Before withdrawing from the WGC-Bridgestone, Koepka was 13th at Oakmont, second at the FedEx St. Jude at TPC Southwind, and second in the AT&T Byron Nelson. JB Holmes ($7,700) – When you think about long courses, you think about JB Holmes. Baltusrol features two 500-yard par 4s on the front nine and 17 and 18 are both par 5s measuring over 550 yards.
Holmes  ->  positive

And despite not closing out the win last week, Lingmerth has been hot lately: He is tied for third in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score. Humpnostication  Another highly-rated player in Levitan’s model, Johnson Wagner, has made five straight cuts here and has a second-place finish on his resume from 2013. Further, Wagner is fresh off a T5 finish at another Par 70 TPC course last week, where he posted 78.0 DraftKings points.
Johnson Wagner,  ->  positive

His form reads 7,19,11,8 since last October and comes to Riviera on the back of a top 10 finish last week in Pebble Beach. Casey started the season with a T7 at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia. He started with a disappointing 77 in round one but bounced back with an impressive 63 in round two followed by a 69,65 over the weekend.
Casey  ->  positive

People will be hesitant to play Spieth, despite being the third highest priced player, because of his poor recent form and with Augusta looming right around the corner. There is no doubt Spieth needs a huge week to gain momentum for the next week to throw his name in the ring as the betting favorites alongside Tiger and Rory. This is the last week he has to make a splash, and no one would be shocked if in two weeks time, Spieth has won back-to-back events.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Although there is a chance he could come in above five percent this week, I’m calling for a surprising under five percent from Branden this week. Grace is tied for 16th in the field with his 68.5 Recent Adj Rd Score, he has five top-15 finishes in his last eight events, and he has performed well in the last two PGA Championships, producing an average of 103.75 DraftKings points. Double S  As always, the first way we can use FantasyLabs to find potentially low-owned yet talented golfers in our Models is to leverage our Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) metric.
Grace  ->  positive

The trend has been cemented by a pair of top 10s at TPC Kuala Lumpur, coincidentally in each of the first odd-numbered years it hosted. Cameron Smith … TPC Kuala Lumpur is where the Aussie laid the foundation in earnest for his future on the PGA TOUR. It was three years ago that he tied for fifth in what was his first-ever start on the circuit.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

The 44-year-old registered ten top-25 finishes and finished the season ranked fourth in strokes gained with approaches to the tee, that is one place above Dustin Johnson! Cink’s issue has been converting his good play into a high finish, he never bettered a T10 but if he keeps knocking eventually a top-5 or more might fall his way. With a couple of top-20 finishes at Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club under his belt.
Cink’s  ->  positive

Other: Webb Simpson, Joel Dahmen  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Russell Henley, Bill Haas, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Si Woo Kim, Gary Woodland, Ollie Schienderjans, Nick Taylor, Joel Dahmen  Bets:  Russell Henley 40-1  Sean O’Hair 75-1 EW  Robert Garrigus 200-1 EW and top 20 at 8-1 He’s a good gpp target on DraftKings this week and is riding a hot putter ahead of this year’s tournament. Even with his inconsistency Garrigus is still ranked top 50 in both Birdie or Better and Par 4 scoring, making him look like a nice statistical fit for this course as well.
Harris English,  ->  positive

With both golfers projected to be in the Top 5 of ownership, I won't have a whole lot of exposure this week as a GPP player. Top Current Form Targets  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (12/1)  Draftkings ($11,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    Since turning pro after the US Open last year, Rahm has vaulted up the world rankings all the way from 551st to 13th. Wow!
Rahm  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7200): For whatever reason, Kyle Stanley has been consistently under-priced on DraftKings event after event – all he’s done this season is average 68.25DK points, make 10 of 12 cuts, and finish in the top-25 six times (50%). He’s coming off a T8 at the Shell Houston Open where he hit 79.17% of his greens, which is an example of just one reason to use Stanley this week, his GIR%. Stanley is 5th on Tour in that category which goes along with his 12th ranking in SG: Approach, 6th in SG: Tee to Green, and 7th in Proximity to the Hole.
Stanley  ->  positive

While the Scot has succeeded on all surfaces, it was a regression toward form that yielded just the singular top 10 in 2017. Kevin Na … It hasn't been a bad season, but it's been his worst while healthy in nine years. It also hasn't been any one thing, so there's a direct relationship between his stats and his production.
Kevin Na  ->  negative

Play him with absolute confidence. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Kyle Stanley ($6700) : Stanley finally picked up his first win in years at the Quicken Loans National, and he managed to pull it off while losing strokes to the field with his putter. That speaks to just how talented a golfer he is getting from tee to green, and at an incredible value of only $6700, Stanley is almost a must-play.
Stanley  ->  positive

Russell Henley ($8200): 16th in Bogey Avoidance is a good place to start for the Georgia native, who’s been having an excellent year on Tour – 1st at the Shell Houston Open, and top-10s at Valspar and the RSM – and should easily continue that here. Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour.
Thomas,  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Jon Rahm 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  It's the mark of the 23 year-old that Jon Rahm not only attended the CareerBuilder Challenge last week (no doubt ignoring a rather large cheque from Abu Dhabi organisers as a result), but won a tournament which hadn't seen an elite player victorious since Phil Mickelson in 2004. In doing so Rahm, as I mentioned at Kapalua when we were on-board him at 12/1, destroyed a set of well established tournament trends. It's obvious that the World Number 2 is just that kind of phenom who's taking apart well-established trends and records to boot.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

That being said, Perez has been excellent this year out of the rough (40’2” to the pin, 22nd) and is great with a short iron in his hand, and like Ollie is better (relatively) outside 10’ than inside. On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG. Perez has consistently been a great play on DraftKings, because he’s one of the best in the field at putting up birdies.
Perez  ->  positive

With several bookmakers paying 8 places, we can make a healthy profit from another good finish. 1pt each-way Francesco Molinari at 80/1 Sky Bet (8 places; 1/5 odds)  For my final selection i’m going with an old favourite – Paul Dunne. There is a danger I follow him off a cliff but at crazy odds a top-8 finish stills land a healthy return and that isn’t a mad proposition.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

He plays comfortably in Florida and comes off a nice T4 finish at the Honda Classic two weeks ago. Horschel leads the PGA Tour in GIR with DJ and Spieth just behind him in that category. He also finished 2nd in tee to green at Honda Classic.
Horschel  ->  positive

On the other hand, our continued faith in the Church of Rahm once again rewarded us with a rock-solid top-ten finish that gained us numerous points on the field since, as usual, the field continues to doubt him at their own peril. We also got solid finishes from Reed, Hadwin, Lowry, and Stricker to help buoy the hits our cash lines took from Kuchar, Furyk, and Webb as well as a lackluster performance by the uber-chalky Justin Rose for his price. For those reasons – and a sound strategy of building more than one hedge cash lineup – most of our subscribers managed to take down a modest cash game ROI with 5/6 lines, so I’m rather content about that.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Don’t care. Rose has been in REALLY strong form basically all year, he’s just lacking a win. He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old.
Rose  ->  positive

I hope I can keep that going and continue to post a steady stream of top 20s. Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

In three starts at Riviera his form reads 23-4-11, so it is hard to not see him better each of those results this week and win again. Simply put, 10/1 is too big and if Spieth hadn’t of won last week, Matsuyama would have been favourite. When finishing 11th last year he had flu early on in the week, failing to practice at all on the Tuesday and was also limited to 9 holes on the Wednesday.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
Rickie Fowler  ->  negative

When breaking down ownership and trying to come up with popularity, I love the tools over at FanShareSports as they break down every piece of information on articles and social media mentions to provide us with Tag COunts, Sentiment Ratings, Subject Tags, Salary Differential week to week and much more. Top Course History Targets  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#7)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($11,700)  FanDuel ($12,300)  Rickie missed the cut here at the Honda Classic in his first two trips in 2010 and 2011 but has been enjoying success here ever since. He struggled a bit in 2015 but rebounded with a T6 in 2016 and won the event last year and will now try to go back to back at PGA National.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Betfair Sportsbook have gone 5 places each way at 1/5 odds plus get £/€30 of free bets for new accounts - current odds here . My selections are as follows:  Jordan Spieth 5pts Win 11/2 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, T&Cs apply:  I'd be going against my whole train of thought that I've had since the FedEx Cup Playoffs started if I didn't back Texan Jordan Spieth this week in Atlanta. Yes he's the favourite, yes he's a short price, but in my mind he captures the FedEx Cup and the Tour Championship this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The Aussie hasn’t cracked the top-10 yet in 2017 but he has played solid in spots, especially of late, suggesting a big week may be coming soon. Ogilvy comes into North Carolina on the back of three top-30 finishes in his last four starts and he’s had success when he’s made the trek to North Carolina in the past, having made the cut in 10 out of 11 appearances at this event. Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

His win at the Tour Championship, where he held off Player of the Year, Justin Thomas was especially impressive and whilst this season has not yet lived up to expectations, a slight lull in form had to be expected. Just one missed cut this season suggests that, despite a struggle to reach the heights of last year, Schauffele can still grind out results without bringing his best stuff and with top-9 finishes at both the CIMB Classic (3rd) and the Genesis Open (T9) on the PGA Tour, as well as a T2 finish at the Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan, he is clearly still capable of flashing brilliance week-to-week. This event will be right up Xander’s street, with his distance off the tee a huge weapon when looking to overcome the long par 4’s and 5’s here.
Xander’s  ->  positive

75. Ryan Fox - $6,600 (250-1)    Fox is a 30-year-old New Zealander who plays on the European Tour. And lately, he's played quite well, with twin T4s at the Irish and Scottish Opens the past two weeks, and a solo sixth the week before at the French Open.
Ryan Fox  ->  positive

So, next for me is William McGirt, who gained his first PGA Tour title just over a year ago by beating a similar field and is capable of doubling up here. At 39th in greens hit, McGirt continues to strike the ball nicely and while he wasn't a factor last weekend, he showed up nicely enough for a couple of rounds on a golf course he admitted was just a little too long for him in the conditions. It may prove to be a positive that McGirt didn't contend at the US Open as he should arrive here relatively fresh and it's his ability to perform on the back of a major which he's either not played in or not contended for which really piques my interest.
McGirt,  ->  positive

I think a Top 25 is his floor this week and I will be using him in all formats. Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#45)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($10,200)  FanDuel ($9,300)  Looking at that same Strokes Gained: Ball Striking stat, Tony Finau ranks #2 behind Stanley and sits ahead of him in the overall model. This is due to his 3rd rank in Par 4 Scoring, 2nd rank in Par 5 Scoring, 4th rank in Birdie or Better %, and 10th rank in Bogey Avoidance.
Stanley  ->  positive

And like last year, the wind is forecast to be fairly benign, especially for an oceanside course, so scoring could approach Spieth's near-record of 30-under. Key Stats to Winning at Kapalua    • Driving distance  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling  • One-putt percentage (putts per GIR)    Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy  2009 - Geoff Ogilvy  2008 - Daniel Chopra  2007 - Vijay Singh    Champion's Profile    When we see 400-plus-yard drives, it's only natural to think this course favors the biggest hitters. But other than Dustin Johnson four years ago, the champions have been of standard length -- or in the case of Zach Johnson in 2014 and Steve Stricker in 2012, even sub-standard.
Spieth's  ->  positive

A win here would further elevate his status in the game, and it looks to be a great event for him to do so. Luke List 80/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Luke List looks exceptional value this week, as he looks to build on his 3rd place finish in Houston two weeks ago. List ranks above average in both Greens in Regulation (33rd) and Scrambling (36th) on the PGA Tour this season and has some very good finishes as a result.
List  ->  positive

Plus in truth, it will be an enormous shock were Martin Flores to challenge for the title, and it will be hard to get his odds to shorten up sufficiently to cash out. Though a winner on last year's Web.com Tour, Flores has rarely even contended at this level. Nevertheless, his credentials point to a respectable finish at least.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

Much like Chez Reavie with solid recent performances I would expect Bradley to be cash chalk and feel that this is well deserved. Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times.
Reavie  ->  positive

Add it all up and the risk is much too high for the projected ownership but if you are wanting to get some of that local knowledge in your lineup, roster Webb on FanDuel in the mid $7K range. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage.
Haas  ->  positive

1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 150/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) Whilst his game is in good shape, he could crack the top-10 again and perhaps aim even higher. A veteran of Muirfield Village, he’s made his last 14 cuts at the course with five top-10 finishes.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

The strength of Rose's game, tee to green, would appear to suit the Club de Golf Chapultepec layout. Wildcard: Alex Noren  View player profile  With four European Tour wins in the last seven months Alex Noren is always a threat, wherever he tees it up. Whilst the Swede is yet to perform at that same level in Majors and WGCs, just one top ten in 25 combined starts, he does arrive in Mexico on the back of his best WGC finish of T12th at last year's WGC HSBC Champions.
Noren  ->  positive

And yet, this course has plenty of attributes that he'll be familiar with and which can bring the best out of him. As with Garcia, a course that runs firm and fast and is framed by trees suits Schwartzel's game and eye while the fairways are Kikuya - just as they are in his native South Africa where the 2011 Masters champ has captured eight of his 11 European Tour wins. His poor start to 2017 has been curious.
Schwartzel's  ->  positive

Instead, I'll take a player at double the odds and make Luke List my 50/1 headline bet. For this lengthy Greg Norman layout where the par fives need two huge bashes, I want a big hitter on board and List is definitely that man. The American is 3rd in Driving Distance this year and, although he's not the most accurate, his power helps rank him 17th in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee.
List  ->  positive

Going into the BMW, Leishman is a very healthy seventh in the FedEx Cup standings after he took another big leap with third place at TPC Boston last time. Leishman got himself in a great position to win the tournament before a poor tee-shot at 10 set him off on the wrong path coming home but it's hard to be too down about a top three. "Game is in a good spot, playing well," Leishman said later.
Leishman  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy (8): Starts in the opposite wave as DJ, and there is no concerns with wasting starts since Rory has been sidelined for so long. =SUPER SUBS =  Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott      Group B    Jordan Spieth (3): Has won a U.S. Open already and has some experience at Erin Hills (2011 U.S. Amateur).

In our VIP Spreadsheet, we can see Danny Lee is third in the entire field in field adjusted Greens in Regulation. As a guy who traditionally performs better to the field on par threes and fours then par fives I like Lee a lot this week. Adam Hadwin – Cash – DK: $6900 FD: $7600  Hadwin has cooled off from his great form we saw earlier in the season but he still lines up great for the course and does so at an affordable price.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Granted, he has since missed another weekend but that came alongside Harold Varner at the Zurich, where they at least fared better in the second round with a combined 65. Kaufman is a big-hitting youngster who should find this test to his liking and with the above in mind might just be able to throw his name into the mix at the same price James Hahn was sent off prior to winning this a year ago. Daniel Berger is attracting money and I can see why - this appears to be a good course for him, signs have been largely positive of late, and he's easily forgiven a missed cut alongside Thomas Pieters in the Zurich where perhaps their similar styles left them vulnerable.
Kaufman  ->  positive

Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast. Reavie has a habit of holding his form, he's currently inside the top-25 ranked players on poa annua and he ranks third for Par 4 performance on the PGA Tour and 12th for GIR, so he looks like a great statistical fit.
Reavie  ->  positive

He’s got a great blend of recent form and course history to bank on here. After him, there are some good values in the $9K range including Russell Henley (see below), Danny Lee and Tony Finau who are all cash game worthy targets. Other players I would consider for this format would be Kevin Streelman, Gary Woodland, Harris English, Nick Taylor and Robert Streb.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Aggressive (3rd in Going for the Green) and potent on the par-5s (2nd in par-5 Birdie or Better), Koepka won at Erin Hills which played pretty-much to a PGA Championship format back in June. 5th at Whistling Straits in 2015 and 4th at Baltusrol last year summarise perfectly that Koepka's power-packed game is ideal for the PGA of America's premier title. What really sells his chances to me this week though are a few results on his CV that jump from off the page and his red-hot putter of late.
Koepka  ->  positive

With that being said, lets hop into some of the picks. KEY STATS FOR DFS PGA THIS WEEK:  Strokes Gained T-G Strokes Gained Putting Birdie or Better Drive Distance Fairways Hit GIR  DraftKings PGA Picks of the Week  Jon Rahm ($9800)  Jon Rahm is coming off yet another stellar performance as he finished T15 at the Safeway Open, carding an ace to go with it. We won’t be expecting another ace for Rahm, but we can expect another Top 20 finish.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Finally, I can’t resist a small play on Louisiana locals John Peterson and Andrew Loupe. Peterson is a brilliant ball-striker who has rededicated himself and with some results this season, while Loupe is long, aggressive and volatile. It could make for a disaster, but if Loupe is on a going week he can make birdies with the best of them and I can see him being given the opportunity to shine in fourballs in particular, with Peterson likely to stay out of trouble even after a couple of disappointing weeks.
Loupe.  ->  positive

Sweden's Henrik Stenson prepares to putt on the 5th hole on day three of the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links, Troon, Scotland, Saturday July 15, 2017. (Mark Runnacles/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)  IRVINE, Scotland (AP) — Henrik Stenson is pessimistic about his chances of successfully defending the British Open title at Royal Birkdale next week. The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again.
Henrik Stenson  ->  negative

10th at the Sanderson Farms and 7th at the Shriners shows what kind of talent we're dealing with here. Beau was 3rd after 54 holes in Jackson, and in Las Vegas he shot a field-leading -5/66 in the teeth of the Saturday wind to take a step further and lead after 54 holes. 2nd at the Air Capital Classic at Crestview CC in Wichita appeals - PGA West champions Dufner, Vegas, Perez and Swafford have all performed well there, and despite missing the cut on his 2018 debut last week, Hossler was still hitting 80.6% Greens in Regulation.
Vegas  ->  positive

He ranks 12th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and third in Strokes Gained: Around the Green on the year, suggesting he’s on top of pretty much every facet of his game, outside of his putter. Casey hit the ball brilliantly at the Honda Classic but was near dead last in putting for the week (and still finished 11th). He may have found something in Mexico though as he gained strokes on the field putting in the final two rounds.
Casey  ->  positive

Importantly, two of those top-15’s have come in his last two starts, finishing T10 at both The Northern Trust and the Dell Technologies Championship, getting hot at the very best time. Tee-to-green, Rose has stood out in the last couple starts, particularly at The Northern Trust, where he ranked 4th in that department. He also led the field in SG: Approach that week and although he struggled with his approaches on his last start (48th), he still looked superb Tee-to-Green ranking inside the top-10 (9th) once again.
Rose  ->  positive

And while glowing praise around his achievements doesn't mean much in relation to this event, Cantlay would be a top-40 player in birdie average terms had he played enough rounds to qualify, and his no-weakness, all-round game seems ideally suited to a course which has thrown up all kinds of players. Cantlay shot 60 when playing in the Travelers Championship as an amateur back in 2011 so his adaptability and scoring prowess is not in question and he does actually have some experience of Conway Farms, having played in the Western Amateur here back in 2009. Video element not supported Cantlay's tee on No.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Even though we haven’t seen his best golf for a while, Lovemark is still ranked 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and has accumulated seven top-10s in the past year and a half on tour. With this sort of pedigree, and a game possibly on the upswing, this is a great time to buy low on Lovemark, as he has plenty of upside for the price we are getting this week on DraftKings. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Justin Rose,  ->  positive

A veteran now of 2 FedEx Cup Playoff campaigns, he was 13th last year at the Plainfield-hosted Barclays when entering the tournament with indifferent form and was 7th at Conway Farms - an event where Nick Watney finished 2nd in 2013. Matsuyama is clearly warming to the PlayOff task and it's worth remembering that his first PGA Tour win came 'Up-State' at Jack's Tournament in Ohio. Very much a form horse who thrives on Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and whose tee-to-green game - and scrambling - is top notch right now.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Far from it in fact. Walker sat second turning for home in round four last year before a dreadful back-nine saw him find water on both 15 and 17 and he showed up in his two previous visits too. He sat second at halfway two years ago and he sat fifth at halfway in 2012.
Walker  ->  positive

Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him. Cauley ranks 8th in approaches and had some success earlier in 2017 at corollary courses like Hilton Head and the TPC Stadium course.

Each of the other three guys had been performing with some degree of promise in advance of their victories. Yet, Donald, who sits 196th in the Official World Golf Ranking and surrendered the title of "low Luke" to Luke List (currently 67th) at the conclusion of 2017, shapes up strongest among the foursome in consumer confidence entering their respective tournaments. There isn't a better test to determine if, when you paint your broad strokes, you prefer course history over recent form.
Luke"  ->  positive

It's a sizable concern that he hasn't won anywhere since the US Open two years ago but I'll be very disappointed if he doesn't at least contend. I've laid out my argument for Ross Fisher in this week's each-way column here and I'm following Paul Krishnamurty in with Alex Levy at a triple-figure price. Selections:  Martin Kaymer [44.0]  Ross Fisher @ [80.0]  Alex levy @ [100.0]    I'll be back later with my Sanderson Farms Championship preview later today.
Ross Fisher  ->  positive

I don't think he will win but I can definitely see a third straight Top 10 finish which would be more than enough to make value. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#39)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,200)  FanDuel ($7,100)    Haas, like Casey, is also one of the six players that ranks Top 20 in stats, history, and form. To be honest, if I blacked out their names on my sheet I would almost not be able to tell the difference between them statistically.
Haas  ->  positive

Third on the list is Jordan Spieth who has played here twice and finished Top 10 both times. Spieth's issues over his last three tournaments have been the putting as he has lost strokes to the field in each tournament(Sony, ToC, Tour Champ). I think he figures out this week and of the three, is my favorite play in this tier.
Spieth  ->  positive

This is also very much his time of year. Poulter has won eight times from October to December versus just two titles across the preceding three months and while that's in part due to field strength, it's also a reflection of the fact he so often has had more to play for than others as the campaign draws to a close. At 54th in the world rankings that's very much the case once more and Poulter will know that gaining access to next year's majors and World Golf Championships is his best route back into the Ryder Cup side.
Poulter  ->  positive

He hasn’t been in the best form, but has played TPC Boston seven times and only once missed the cut, and is simply too good to be offered at this price. Fade: We give you Bubba Watson. Some places fit him, and some don’t.
Bubba Watson.  ->  negative

8th for Greens in Regulation, 2nd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green, 6th for Proximity to Hole and 8th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green show an approach game which is in rude health and Leishman is a proven Bermudagrass green winner who shot -23/261 to win the BMW Championship last August. Brian Harman 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.

Studs  *In order of my rankings  Graham DeLaet ($10,600) – DeLaet MC last week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, but had strung together five strong weeks before last. It was a tough track and a tough field, so I’ll give DeLaet a pass. He’s still searching for that first win, and hopefully, the recent win by fellow Canadian Adam Hadwin provides the extra motivation DeLaet needs to break into the winner’s circle.
DeLaet  ->  positive

I think he's a great GPP play and could see using him in cash, but there are some better "on the surface" plays at cheaper price tags for cash games. -- Taras Pitra  Matt Kuchar  This is one of those guys I lock into my rosters every year at Augusta regardless of form. Before last week, it had been a rough season for the veteran, having only recorded one top-25.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na,  ->  positive

Looking at recent play, he's finished top 5 in four of his last six worldwide starts. Cameron Smith ($7,600): The Aussie is red-hot, worldwide. Going to ride the hot hand and play this youngster.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Not sure I could think of a worse course for Thomas Pieters than PGA National.
Thomas Pieters  ->  negative

Errant drives are captured by tough Bermudagrass rough with most fairways on the property being tree-lined ensuring plenty of blocked approach shots for those that deviate. Slashing the ball from the tee was a real negative until both Jordan Spieth's and Chris Kirk's victories here across the past 2 renewals. Both only hit 50% of fairways but from there miraculous scrambling and red-hot putters across both players delivered a new way of conquering Colonial.
Chris Kirk's  ->  positive

Zach has always been known for his short-game and in particular his putting, but so far this season he currently ranks just 81st in Strokes Gained: Putting, and should he find his touch on the greens, a win could be on the horizon. In his four starts on Bermuda greens so far this season, Johnson has ranked 33rd, 40th, 65th and 29th in SG: Putting and whilst it is encouraging that his best effort came last week, there is clearly scope for improvement. Should he find something on the greens this week, that he has struggled to so far this season, Johnson could well be in contention come Sunday.
Johnson  ->  positive

Using the Strokes Gained stats, he was ranked 1st in Approach-The-Green last week, gaining 8.652 shots on the field. Scrambling is another key at Augusta National and Spieth was 9th in Houston with 78.6%. One other hugely underrated stat at the US Masters is Bogey Avoidance.
Spieth  ->  positive

Leishman ranked sixth and fifth in Greens in Regulation Percentage in his appearances at the DEAN & DELUCA and the Byron Nelson, and he was also second in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee last week at the Memorial. For the season, Leishman ranks 25th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee stats and has nice major championship experience to fall back on this week, too, with a T4 at Augusta from back in 2011 and a famous playoff loss at the Open Championship in 2015. Leishman is also coming off his best finish ever at a U.S. Open (T18) from last season and is a known wind player who has thrived at open-style venues in the past; including the ultimate links test at St. Andrews.
Leishman  ->  positive

Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town. He is a safe cash game play but does not provide much upside in tournaments.
Molinari  ->  positive

High Cost Players - Fantasy Golf Lineup Picks for DraftKings (PGA DFS)  Build a lineup with either: Justin Thomas ($11,900) or Bill Haas ($9,200)  Two different types of players but both come back to the Copperhead with some nice course history. Thomas finished T18 last season and T10 the year before in his first trip while Haas finished runner-up last season after a playoff loss to Charl Schwartzel and T14 back in 2014. Thomas comes into this week with the FedEx Cup points lead after picking up three wins in his first nine events this season.
Haas  ->  positive

2. Dustin Johnson  This article has been easy so far as I cannot possibly think of any other golfer who will have an absolute boom – again – than the straightest, longest player on the PGA Tour. Ever since DJ learned how to master his wedge game, he’s been an absolute force.
DJ  ->  positive

Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course. Hadwin is playable in all formats this week. Jason Rouslin: Cameron Smith ($6,900)  Smith made it in as an alternate last week in Scottsdale, and he turned that opportunity into a decent 42nd place finish.
Hadwin  ->  positive

There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
Si Woo Kim  ->  negative

ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR. It was therefore with some amusement that those of us on this side of the pond watched the US lead coverage from Torrey Pines 3 weeks ago, during which we were treated to interviews and commentary that portrayed Alex as a complete rookie, who would potentially react like a rabbit in the headlights when faced with the possibility of winning on US soil!
Noren.  ->  positive

Tommy Fleetwood at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) – the best ball-striker in Europe lately can demonstrate that he is firmly on the rise  1pt e.w. Matt Fitzpatrick at 125/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – three wins already and accuracy from the tee could take him a long way  1pt Kevin Na in top-five and top-10 markets at 25/1 and 10/1 respectively – should go well on the back of fourth last time out  When the PGA Tour decided that Trump National Doral was no longer for them, they meant it, because the contrast between Doral and Club de Golf Chapultepec, home of the revamped WGC-Mexico Championship, looks to be a stark one. Post-revamp, Doral had become a long-ball paradise unlike any other.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 31st  The mention of Bozzelli above leads me on nicely to my last selection of the week. Regular readers will know that I was on Bozzelli a couple of weeks ago at the Honda at the massive odds of 350-1. Whilst we got no return on that investment his finish of 13th place more than justified my view that he is a player to keep an eye on and one who could well reward backers at a big price in the near future.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

This week you can expect things to be a bit unique in that it’s a short field WGC event with no cut and there always tends to be a few surprises that get thrown into the mix on weeks like this. That being said the Salary Vs. Vegas Odds chart brings us the likes of Jimmy Walker who at roughly 60:1 odds is only $7,000 and on the surface seems underpriced. I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Rickie Fowler 1pt EW 20/1  Jon Rahm 1pt EW 20/1  Thomas Pieters 0.5pts EW 40/1  Branden Grace 0.5pts EW 40/1  Kevin Kisner 0.5pts EW 55/1  Total staked = 7 pts  *Paddypower paying 8 places*  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6/ Kisner is another proven wind specialist and could be another one to keep an eye on here. The American also ticks a few key statistical boxes here ranking 12th in driving accuracy, 23rd in strokes gained putting and 28th in scrambling.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

He is a bomber who putts well and although he can be a little wild, we get a huge break in pricing versus his odds to win the event allowing us to use him early this week. Erik Dantoft: Brandon Hagy ($8,300) (FanDuel, rounds 1 and 2)  Hagy is an ideal round 1-2 golfer this week on FanDuel. His inexpensive salary allows you to spend up for a top tier round 3-4 golfer, but more importantly, Hagy is in a great position to score you some early round 1-2 fantasy points with the likelihood of adding some finishing points at the end of the tournament as well.
Hagy  ->  positive

With Ryan Moore at a premium price, Kirk is as good an option to anchor your lineup as any. His form will be his main calling card this week — the Georgia product is currently riding a wave of top 10s, including a tie for second at last week’s Sanderson Farms Championship. While Kirk has finished no better than a tie for 36th in either of his two appearances at the Shriners, the relatively poor caliber of this week’s field helps him to stand out.
Kirk  ->  positive

This contest has a large number of entries, with guaranteed prize payouts, which means we can't play it safe if we want to see our name at the top! DraftKings Picks:    Chris Kirk ($11,300): s the Vegas favorite, he also gets the billing of highest-priced DK golfer. The hope is the deters some ownership away from him, since he's not usually the top dog on the board.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts. Statistically, Chappell also seems to suit the TPC San Antonio course well as he ranks inside the top-40 in both Driving Distance and par 5 scoring, even after his poor start to the year. To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68.
Chappell  ->  positive

With news breaking that he could miss the US Open for his daughter’s graduation, Phil will have extra incentive to win this week. Russell Henley ($9,800)  In most weeks we would advise against paying this much for Henley. But in a weak field where he placed seventh last season, we are advising it.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

We surely need - and require - something better from the top price in the field. Spieth has been playing well for months, with five straight top-10s going back to autumn. This format is not for everyone, but Spieth says he likes it, and that counts for a lot (plus he said they give him "great food").
Spieth  ->  positive

Hadwin ranks T5 alongside Steele in Par 5 Performance and 18th in Strokes Gained: Putting (down from 7th last week), so statistically he ticks the boxes for this event. Billy Horschel ($8,900) – Horschel loves this course and once again if he can get hot with the putter, he will contend. He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

High-Priced  UPDATE: Dustin Johnson (back) took a serious fall in his Augusta Rental home and is now QUESTIONABLE to compete at the Masters. Dustin Johnson ($11,300) – I suppose it is strictly by virtue of the lack of a green jacket that he is not the top-priced option on the board, but no matter how good Spieth has been at Augusta, it doesn’t seem right that DJ costs less right now. He rested after his win at the Match Play Championship, so he should be relaxed and focused for the year’s first major.
DJ  ->  positive

Given the very minimum price tag, the tee to green ability, the close calls this season and the scoring upside, he’s in play for GPPs this week. Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should.
Tony  ->  negative

But before that he played a starring role alongside Scott Brown to reach a play-off at the Zurich Classic after holing out for eagle at the 72nd and wind back a little further and he was T11 at Hilton Head and runner-up at Bay Hill. Kisner can have a pattern of peaks and troughs in his results and his second place at The Heritage in 2015 was on the back of a missed cut in Houston on his previous start. Go back further and his Web.com win in Chile in 2013 came after he'd had a string of five weekends off.
Kisner  ->  positive

He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions. Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Reed’s  ->  positive

Ross Fisher – $6,900  Ross Fisher was a late addition to The Masters field, so he will definitely be overlooked and less hyped up than other golfers. His pricing fell into a crowded range with Adam Hadwin and Kevin Kisner. Fisher is a lesser known player on the PGA Tour as he is a predominately a Euro Tour golfer, which will help suppress his ownership further.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Fire up Steele in all formats. Jimmy Walker  World Golf Ranking (#25)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($10,500)  FanDuel ($9,700)  After a rough start to the season where he missed three of his first five cuts and a near dead last finish at the HSBC Champions, Walker is starting to pick up steam. He has made seven straight cuts including a T18 most recently at the Masters.
Walker  ->  positive

296 yards (64th), 64.3% fairways (18th), 81.9% greens in regulation (4th), 34"3" proximity to hole (21st), 30.8 % scrambling (71st), 1.58 putts per GIR (1st). 2013, Webb Simpson (-24). 300 yards (55th), 64.3% fairways (13th), 86.1% greens in regulation (4th), 31"1" proximity to hole (4th), 62.5% scrambling (10th), 1.65 putts per GIR (5th).
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

I am looking for him to continue his success this week with another top 10. Jimmy Walker-  Walker has owned this course in recent years with 3 top 12 finishes in the last 4 years, with a T-50 finish last year due to a final round 78, otherwise it could have been another nice result. Last season Walker finished top 25 in par 4 birdie or better scoring, T-17 in birdie average and 46th in strokes gained putting.
Walker-  ->  positive

He'll make his debut in this event with ranks of 19th in BP and 49th in DD. Fade - Anirban Lahiri (59K): Lahiri ranks ninth in BP, which is the best rank in the field, but he ranks outside the top 100 in DD and SGA. He'll also be making his tournament debut, following up a 44th-placed finish at the RBC Heritage.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  negative

He’s one of my favorite targets this week on DraftKings and a player you shouldn’t overlook based his sub-par results from earlier in the year. My Value: Marc Leishman ($6,700)  Leishman has had a strong season by any standard thus far as the Aussie picked up his second career win on the PGA this year at the tough Bay Hill CC, and has also amassed a total of seven top-25 finishes in 13 starts so far. The former rookie of the year may finally be ready to reach his full potential this season and has looked solid over his last few starts.
Leishman  ->  positive

Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play. The other standout is probably one that you’ve heard mentioned elsewhere in Charley Hoffman. It seems fairly obvious that Hoffman is under priced this week, which is in agreement with the charts.
Hoffman.  ->  positive

Rose, Snedeker, Kuchar, Furyk, and Lowry come to mind (see below). Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Had Harman have just shot level par on the opening day (he broke par in each of the last three rounds), he would have finish in a tie for 2nd. It was a similar story in 2016, when Harman finished T17, as Harman finished two shots shy of the three players who were tied for 9th. This time around though, he had no horrific rounds, he was just steady all week long (69-71-70-70).
Harman  ->  positive

If he can keep his approach game up and find the green, he’ll have the opportunity to take it down this week. Kyle Stanley ($7200): For whatever reason, Kyle Stanley has been consistently under-priced on DraftKings event after event – all he’s done this season is average 68.25DK points, make 10 of 12 cuts, and finish in the top-25 six times (50%). He’s coming off a T8 at the Shell Houston Open where he hit 79.17% of his greens, which is an example of just one reason to use Stanley this week, his GIR%.
Stanley  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Puerto Rico Open - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Luke List 1.5pt EW 28/1 with bet £5 get £20 free via this link:  Luke List is definitely the sort of player who wins the Puerto Rico Open. Powerful (2nd in Driving Distance), a great second-shot player (38th in Strokes Gained Approach to the Green), who can score heavily (9th Birdie Average, 19th Scoring Average).
Luke List  ->  positive

For cash games rostering two of Rahm, Stenson, Rose, Rickie, Scott, over jamming Spieth in, seems more optimal. Of the higher priced plays I prefer Fowler ($10,000), Rose ($9,700) and Stenson ($10,400) who are all rested after skipping the match play. Some solid lower tier values could be Billy Horschel ($7,700), Tony Finau ($7,100) and Ollie Schniederjans ($6,700).
Fowler  ->  positive

He's definitely become a little more conservative to avoid those ghastly big numbers we were always accustomed to seeing, but 3 eagles over his last 7 rounds highlight that he can still cause damage on the par-5s. A 3-time PGA Tour winner, Vegas has won both the 2016 and 2017 RBC Canadian Opens held at Glen Abbey. The 2016 win featured Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and 3rd at Glen Oaks last August, in addition to his 3rd here in 2011, highlights that Jhonattan is comfortable on Poa Annua.
Jhonattan  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Patrick Reed – $9,700  Patrick Reed has been on the struggle bus all season long. His last top 15 finish was at the CareerBuilder in January and has yet to finish inside the top 20 since.
Patrick Reed  ->  negative

His game is dialed in, and I expect it to continue on this coastal course. Kisner ranks 12th in SG: Approach, 41st in Scrambling, 42nd in SG: Off the Tee, and 37th in Birdie or Better %. At this price point, Kisner makes for a quality core play.
Kisner  ->  positive

And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday.
Chris Stroud,  ->  positive

Instead, head has to rule the heart and therefore it's time to take advantage of the slightly inflated odds on Justin Rose. Tiger's 6/1 means Rose is a couple of points bigger than he would have been without the great man's revival and 14/1 looks very acceptable indeed. The Englishman admitted he'd found the WGC-Mexico a hard event to make his comeback after more than a month off due to the altitude and pulling of funky clubs.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

If you do use Phil make sure you check for any late breaking news on his status. My Pick: Jamie Lovemark ($9,600)  Lovemark is off to a fantastic start to the 2017 season, and one has to think his first win can’t be far away. With a T6 and a T4 in his last two starts, Lovemark will again tee it up at PGA West where he was in the mix last year before bombing with a one-over final round.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Don’t care. Rose has been in REALLY strong form basically all year, he’s just lacking a win. He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old.
Rose  ->  positive

Spieth ranks 22nd on tour in that range and was 10th before struggling with the new greens at the Players. Backing up his putting, Spieth ranks 2nd in BA and BoB% and he comes in 6th in Par 4 Scoring. Coming off missed cuts in two of his last three events, we may get Spieth at reduced ownership this week, which makes him a great play in GPPs.
Spieth  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Cantlay.  ->  positive

I see only upside with Kaymer who was one of only a few players who managed to shoot par or better in all four rounds last week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7,200): Maybe the strangest price of anyone, Oosthuizen put together his third straight solid start last week and also had four rounds of par or better at the Honda—and also lead the field in Greens in Regulation percentage. Oosthuizen has been uber-solid off the tee in his last two starts ranking 8th and 11th for Driving accuracy respectively.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

He has been owned by an average of 33.3 percent of lineups in those tournaments. Last year, with a salary $500 lower, Johnson tipped the scales at 42.8 percent average ownership on his way to 123.5 DraftKings points and a +49.09 Plus/Minus. You can check out player exposure and much more with our PGA Contests Dashboard.
Johnson  ->  positive

His price is a little high over at FanDuel making him GPP only but on DraftKings under $9K, I will be using him in all formats. Bud Cauley  World Golf Ranking (#107)  Vegas Odds (33/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($9,500)  Bud Cauley is another player who has trended in the right direction here at the CareerBuilder Challenge over the past few years with finishes of T14 in 2016 and T3 last year after a missed cut in 2014, T37 in 2013, and T30 in his first trip in 2012. Form was definitely not an issue over the two years as he came into the 2016 event with two missed cuts and went into last years event with four missed cuts and a T50.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

J.B Holmes -$6,800  J.B. Holmes is still underpriced, even with DraftKings reverting back to their old pricing system. $6,800 for Holmes is just way too cheap, especially when we are (almost) guaranteed 72 holes from him. Holmes is one of the best birdie makers in the field and will be flipping wedges into these greens all week long.
Holmes  ->  positive

By PGA standards this is very short and the scores reflect this. Last year Pat Perez won the event at -21 and the weekend cut was -2. With a lot of scoring opportunity for players, this event tends to turn into a birdie fest as long as the weather cooperates (which it looks like it will).
Pat Perez  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players this week as follows;  MARTIN PILLER – 200-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED MC  For my first and if you like my headline selection this week I am going to actually start with by far the biggest priced player in my team in the form of a Lone Star State guy Martin Piller. The reason to be Piller heads the list this week is basically his price. I really don’t get it and would say 100s is as big as he should be and certainly not 200s.
Piller.  ->  positive

Pebble Beach has been one of the better spots for the Australian in recent years, missing just two cuts in his last eight. In that span, Jones has managed to accumulate three top-15 finishes, including an 11th and 7th in the last two renewals. Jones has made four starts in the 2016/17 and played just the once since the turn of the new year.
Jones  ->  positive

In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats. Paul Casey ($9,000): I have been using Casey in every tournament this year so why stop now.
Molinari  ->  positive

Market Leaders  Rory McIlroy (11/1)  Justin Thomas (11/1)  Jordan Spieth (11/1)  Dustin Johnson (12/1)  Tiger Woods (14/1)  Justin Rose (14/1)  Selections  Justin Rose 14/1 (General) 2pts e/w:  Whilst I have umm’d and ahh’d over whether the 14/1 is big enough, I simply can’t get away from the fact that I think Justin Rose is the most likely winner of the 2018 Masters. With two 2nd’s and a 10th place finish in his last three starts here, Rose has done all but win the Green Jacket and probably should have won it last year. He has never missed a cut at Augusta and has finished inside the top-10 five times in 12 starts here, so he looks destined to win one in his career.
Justin Thomas (11/1) Jordan Spieth (11/1) Dustin Johnson (12/1) Tiger Woods (14/1) Justin Rose  ->  positive

He’s playing the absolute best golf of his career, and you’d be crazy to not start almost every GPP lineup you create with him this week. Jason Day ($10,100) – Day fell apart on Sunday (as did many bombers) at Sawgrass, but that shouldn’t take away from the positives we’ve been seeing out of him lately now that he is seemingly healthy. This is a golf course where Jason Day can open up and hulk smash the golf ball with very little concern over whether he’s in the fairway or the rough.
Day  ->  positive

. Course Adj Rd Score (count of at least two): 67.7, Paul Casey ($9,500)  Casey has been on an absolute tear recently. His back-to-back second-place finishes and triple-digit DraftKings scores are sure to make him a popular pick going forward.
Casey  ->  positive

The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
Rory  ->  positive

The PGA Tour stays in Texas for this week's Houston Open and Dave Tindall has three each-way bets lined up...  "Ranked 10th in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green this season and 14th in Scoring Average, a good putting week and Finau is a big contender here in my book." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Tony Finau e.w. @ 30/1  With the US Masters a week away, several of the likely Green Jacket contenders are warming up at this week's Shell Houston Open.
Finau  ->  positive

With the wind set to blow this week I am looking to stick with players who are proven in the wind or/and are renowned ‘ball strikers’ and Knox certainly ticks those boxes. Knox’s renowned ball striking strengths had dipped over the 2016/17 period but his 2018 stats show that he is back on track as he currently lies 38th in Driving Accuracy and 6th in GIR. All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.
Knox  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 30-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 36th  No prizes for me for originality I’m afraid as my third pick this week goes to another player who was in our team at the Honda three weeks ago in the form of the inform Alex Noren. For want of copying and pasting my thoughts on Noren back at the Honda I shall simply say the obvious in that the Swede’s start to his first full season on the PGA tour has been hugely impressive. Based on current form there is every argument for his price to be as short, if not shorter than Rickie, Rory, Henrik and a returning Hideki and it is only a lack of course form I’m assuming which has sees him priced up as 30-1 shot.
Noren.  ->  positive

Currently, Reed is looking like a cash game lock and a solid core player in my GPP grouping. Kevin Streelman – FanDuel Value – DK: $7300 FD: $8700  Streelman has been solid lately relying on gaining strokes off of the tee and approaching the green. Although he has been losing strokes putting that can easily turn around week to week and I like the way he has been playing recently.
Kevin Streelman  ->  positive

DJ’s 67.8 LT Adj Rd Score is tied atop this week’s elite field, his 16.6 LT Adj Bird Avg is fifth, and his massive 314.2-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) leads all competitors. Johnson played well in WGC events last season, winning the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and finishing T5, T14, and T5 in three other tournaments. He has three WGC wins in his career.
DJ’s  ->  positive

He is primed for another, as Pat likes to say, “great fantastic” week in Mexico. Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week.
Finau  ->  positive

When the latter dips, he can't really compete so it's been encouraging to see an upturn recently, ranking seventh and eighth in strokes-gained: tee-to-green and inside the top-10 for greens hit in both the Farmers (12th) and Phoenix (26th). Luke List should go well at a big price  List showed up well here on his debut two years ago, sitting second after round one and seventh at halfway only for a third-round 75 to see him fall all the way down to 50th. To his credit, he responded with a best-of-the-day 67 to climb to 20th and with last year's 72-72 seeing him just miss out on the weekend, there's plenty of encouragement when it comes to his course record.
List  ->  positive

Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead. While he’s only four for six in cuts made at this event, three of those finishes have been 25th or better and they include a third place from back in 2013.
Tringale  ->  positive

This week the winner will need to go low. Bob Harig: Haas ($10,500)  Two of Haas' six career PGA Tour victories have come at this tournament, and while the courses might be different, the same basic principle applies: this is almost like stadium golf in the desert, with perfect weather and conditions. Haas is coming off a tie for 13th in Hawaii and he's shot every round he's played at this tournament under par going back to 2008.
Haas  ->  positive

With all this taken into consideration, here are my picks for the 2017 Shell Houston Open. Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week.
Horschel  ->  positive

The latter was particularly noteworthy in that Leishman at last grabbed an opportunity with both hands, making clutch par saves on the final two holes to win by one in an important, poignant renewal of a high-profile event, securing a win which had in truth been long overdue. All of which sets him up for another big major run, and that's something Leishman is very familiar with. He's only played in 21 of them, but on three occasions has finished inside the top-five, most notably when part of a three-way play-off for the Open Championship which ultimately went to Zach Johnson in 2015.
Leishman  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Patrick Cantlay.  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Graham DeLaet  This very talented ball striker can drive fantasy owners crazy by missing cuts when he looks like a great pick, but we need to have a selective memory when it comes to daily fantasy golf. DeLaet makes for an exciting GPP play as he has enormous upside with two top 10s in his last five starts this season and two top-5 finishes in his last three starts at TPC Highlands. He's priced too low this week on FanDuel based upon his odds so there is plenty of value in this pick.-- Zach Turcotte  Brendan Steele  Brendan Steele did his usual thing at the U.S. Open last week -- make the cut and score a bunch of fantasy points.
Graham DeLaet  ->  positive

The average driving distance at Colonial is about 275 yards, largely because longer shots may be penalized. Even though Spieth and Kirk won while ranking down the list in fairways hit, others on the leaderboard and many past champions were highly accurate. Both of them won with terrific putting, while Spieth also was the No.
Kirk  ->  positive

We like this sneaky GPP play. Player to avoid  Brooks Koepka $10,200 – This pains us because we have such a man crush on Brooks. We’ve also been on him heavily since the end of March where he was finding form again.
Brooks Koepka  ->  negative

He even held the 36-hole lead at Firestone last week before settling for a 28th-place finish at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. Kevin Chappell (+7,500)  Looking for a worthy sleeper this week? How about Kevin Chappell?
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Putting 10'-15', BoB% (Birdie or Better), Bogey Avoidance, Scrambling, Rough Proximity. Top-Tier Plays  Dustin Johnson ($11,100)  Dustin Johnson is "Taylor Made" for this course. He ranked sixth or better in three of our key stats from 2016 (1stt in BoB%, 4th in Par 5 Scoring, and 6th in Rough Proximity).
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Capitalize on the field’s reluctance to deploy him on account of his price and recency bias and you may end up finding that he helps you dominate this week. Luke List ($16,500, Mostly GPP) – List has been absolutely red hot since the Fall season began, and his performance last week suggests he’s not stopping now. He has carded nothing worse than a 26th place finish thus far this season, and his combination of absurd power and a surprisingly strong putter (he’s gained 16.34 strokes on the field thus far this season) has put him squarely in our consideration set, particularly on high-scoring tracks.
List  ->  positive

He is also a TCU grad so he has a nice local narrative playing in his favor this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Bud Cauley  Cauley returns to competition this week and has been showing some really good form as of late. If you include the team effort at the Zurich Classic, he has finished in the top-10 in three straight events.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

I don't think he will win but I can definitely see a third straight Top 10 finish which would be more than enough to make value. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#39)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,200)  FanDuel ($7,100)    Haas, like Casey, is also one of the six players that ranks Top 20 in stats, history, and form. To be honest, if I blacked out their names on my sheet I would almost not be able to tell the difference between them statistically.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Arnold Palmer Invitational Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Jason Day & Rickie Fowler – Any time you’re gifted the ability to stack two Top 10 players into your lineup, you do it. Rickie has already won this season, enters in scotching form (T16, 1st, T4), and sits Top 45 in all facets of the strokes gained metric – Off the Tee (23rd), Approach (6th), Around the Green (43rd), and Putting (5th).
Rickie  ->  positive

Last season, Spieth led the PGA Tour in SG: Approach and ranked 10th in terms of proximity. Hideki Matsuyama - $15,400    Despite his putting struggles, Matsuyama has notched a pair of top-three finishes in two appearances at the Tournament of Champions due to his elite ball-striking. During the 2016-17 season he ranked fifth on Tour in proximity on approaches from 150-175 yards and eighth in proximity from 175-200 yards.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Fade - Zach Johnson (77K): Like Taylor, Johnson doesn't match the course at all. The key difference: Johnson costs triple the salary. He is the fourth-most expensive player in this tier and has failed to crack the top 20 in each of his past two attempts.
Johnson  ->  negative

All 6 winners here since 2012 finished in the top 10 for Strokes Gained Putting on the week. My selections are as follows:  Marc Leishman 2pts EW 16/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  "Well, confidence is pretty high, game's in a good spot.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Thanks largely to his Mayakoba win, the runner-up finish at the Wells Fargo and a 3rd at this event last season, Perez finished 15th in the FedEx Cup standings which is by far and away his best performance since its inauguration in 2007. Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign.
Perez  ->  positive

Very few signs of life lately and tough to forget the opening-round 79 at the U.S. Open last month. Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
Day  ->  negative

In 2016 Kevin was in poor form when he arrived at Hilton Head and a disappointing week ensued, however last year he was back in the groove with an 11th place finish, which would have been a lot better but for a poor Sunday. It’s been a slow start to 2018 for Kisner but everything clicked in to place at the Matchplay 3 weeks ago where he finished runner up to Bubba Watson. Last week he backed that up to produce his best finish at Augusta posting a 28th place and I am confident he can continue his good form this week at one of his favourite venues on tour.
Kisner  ->  positive

Horschel finished 11th at the Tournament of Champions to start 2018, before finishing 54th at Torrey Pines and 43rd in Phoenix, so nothing to particularly shout about so far but that doesn’t concern me too much. Horschel tends to play better as the calendar goes on, perhaps taking a while to get into the swing of things (excuse the pun), with all of his wins coming in April or later, and the majority of his top-5 finishes coming in March or later, so I am not too concerned by his average form so far. He is also a better Bermuda putter than he is on other surfaces, ranking 20th in Bermuda Specialists on Futureoffantasy.com  With such strong ties to the Florida area, the only surprise so far at this event is how long it took him to find form here, but now he has, I expect it to be a favourite stop of his for years to come.
Horschel  ->  positive

Should be awesome. Berhow: Dustin Johnson wins at five under, Justin Rose is the runner-up for the second straight major and Mr. Lee Westwood is third. Zak: I've convinced myself that Jason Day will continue his recent solid form and that Erin Hills will play very similar to Whistling Straits (at least for him).
Justin Rose  ->  positive

With all this taken into consideration, here are my picks for the 2017 Shell Houston Open. Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week.

My selections are as follows:  Charley Hoffman 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Charley Hoffman leads the way for me this week and his fifth PGA Tour title can't be too far away as he's playing some exceptional stuff in 2017. 22nd at Augusta, when he went into the final round in 4th spot, 8th at Erin Hills when in the mix all week and 20th last week at Royal Birkdale highlight a player who's having a stellar year.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Having a great punt play will be key.

This week is very different from others.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Five Under Five  Mr. Miyagi  As discussed in this week’s Course Breakdown, Ben Crane has had success at some similar TPC courses. In five events at TPC Southwind and The Old White TPC since 2014, Crane has exceeded his salary-based expectations four times (80.0 percent), averaging a strong +16.20 Plus/Minus on DraftKings:  Moreover, Crane dropped 74.50 DraftKings points at TPC Southwind earlier this month, good for a whopping +25.73 Plus/Minus. Additionally, it’s likely that Crane will keep his tee shots out of trouble this week: Crane is tied for 12th in the field with his 65.6 Driving Accuracy (DA) percentage.
Crane  ->  positive

Eventually he’ll get back to putting 4 rounds together and while I don’t see him contending for a win quite yet, I do expect him to notch his first top 20 finish since the Honda Classic in February, at a venue that should fit him well. Also adding Jason Kokrak as a second Semi-Flier this week. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Padraig MC)    Charley Hoffman– This lucky duck nearly hit his first tee ball OB on Thursday at last week’s British Open, then walked off the hole carding an eagle two.
Jason Kokrak  ->  positive

Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best. 5th at the 2015 PGA Championship at Oak Hill, 2nd at the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont and 2nd at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational are results that jump from his CV.
Scott  ->  positive

He brings good upside for a cheaper price tag and is a solid target this week in DFS. My Sleeper: Ben Martin ($6,900)  Martin quietly put together four solid rounds last week, finishing his week off with a 65 and a T7 finish. This was the second solid finish in a row for Martin, who also finished T22 in his penultimate start at the RSM Classic.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

So far this season has been a painful disappointment for Rory however, as he’s battled injury and generally been searching for his best form. The good news is after two consecutive missed cuts there’s nowhere to go but up for McIlroy. The bad news is there’s nothing to suggest the frustration surrounding his game will disappear this week just because it’s a major.
Rory  ->  negative

Longshots:  Wesley Bryan (150-1 to win, 12-1 top 10, 7-1 top 20)  Wesley Bryan enters this week on the back of two missed cuts, so his odds have dropped significantly. Bryan held the 36-hole lead last year en route to a fourth place finish. PGA National brings back good memories for him.
Bryan  ->  positive

Having gained strokes on the field with it on three of his five starts here, there can be some hope that Molinari will improve for a return to Bay Hill where he'd desperately like to win - not least because his brother was runner-up here at the start of the decade. At third in strokes-gained off-the-tee so far this season, Molinari junior is exuding control from the tee as usual and that formula is a good one here. Molinari's form figures don't look altogether inspiring, but I don't believe he's played in a truly suitable event so far this season.
Molinari  ->  positive

From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play. Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G. That being said, Murray is one of the best in the field this week with his mid-to-long irons and should be able to find the green in scoring position relatively easily.
Murray  ->  positive

SEMI-FLIER (Last week: Hahn t-20th)    Kevin Na– There are 4 Kevins in the field this week (Kisner, Streelman, Na, Tway), and I’ll go with the slowpoke of them all (although sidenote- I do like Streelman, too). Na rallied back to a t-22nd finish at the Quicken Loans National in his last start a couple weeks ago, despite a 75 in the first round and is trending nicely coming into this week.
Na–  ->  positive

7. Justin Rose - Rose came out of the gates hot, and he wrapped up a top-five finish at Riviera, another course ideal for great ballstrikers. 8.
Rose  ->  positive

Reed has been T-13 or better in three of his four Pebble Beach starts. Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed. A little concerned about Mickelson teeing it up for a fourth straight week, but he’s had more success here than anyone in the field.
Patrick Reed.  ->  negative

With the likes of Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler all absent this week, this may well be Casey’s best chance of his 18th professional title for the foreseeable future, should he continue his stand-off with the European Tour. The number of European Tour starts Casey needs to make has been in order to be eligible for the 2018 Ryder Cup has been reduced to four, and he is pleased with that decision. In an interview with Yahoo Casey said “Pelley (European Tour CEO Keith Pelley) is changing it down to four next year and that’s a decent change”.
Casey’s  ->  positive

You can view Erin Hills hole by hole guide by clicking here  Rickie Fowler 20/1  It could be Rickie’s time to bag his first major and who would begrudge him? He arrives in Erin Hills in the best form of his career with a win and six top 10’s so far this season.
Rickie  ->  positive

However, he arrives with -31.1 strokes gained total in his last eight starts. One thing you can usually rely on with Varner is a heap of birdies but those have gone missing as well. He's posted a lower birdie rate than the field in 8 of his last 10 starts.
Varner  ->  positive

Bob Harig: Haas ($10,500)  Two of Haas' six career PGA Tour victories have come at this tournament, and while the courses might be different, the same basic principle applies: this is almost like stadium golf in the desert, with perfect weather and conditions. Haas is coming off a tie for 13th in Hawaii and he's shot every round he's played at this tournament under par going back to 2008. Michael Collins: Haas ($10,500)  One-third of his PGA Tour wins have come at this event where he's the all-time leading money winner at almost $3 million earned!
Haas  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

Either way Day has five top-tens in six US Opens and has proven he can peak for this event, I think he’s close and has my vote this week in DFS. Brooks Koepka ($9,000): While the lack of top salaried players on my selections may seem strange, Brooks Koepka, to me, really does bring just as much DraftKings upside this week as the top three salaried players. Brooks has been all over the place in terms of results lately, but even with the inconsistency he’s still managed to produce over 70 DK points in four of his last five starts.
Brooks  ->  positive

Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him. Cauley ranks 8th in approaches and had some success earlier in 2017 at corollary courses like Hilton Head and the TPC Stadium course.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Other: Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Francesco Molinari, Phil Mickelson, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Russell Henley, Russell Knox, Stewart Cink, Ricky Barnes  – Charl Schwartzel, Harold Varner III, Peter Uihlein, Sam Saunders, Chez Reavie, Danny Lee, Smylie Kaufman  Bets:  Kyle Stanley 40-1  Peter Uihlein 60-1 ew  Stewart Cink 70-1 ew  Harold Varner III 80-1 ew  Ricky Barnes 200-1 ew  Chez Reavie 160-1 ew  San Saunders 200-1 ew He should be able to bounce back here and is capable of taking advantage of a weaker field to post a top ten finish. Last week he gained strokes on the field in approaches over three rounds, but had a terrible back nine on Sunday.
Ricky Barnes  ->  positive

The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
Rory  ->  positive

He could be higher on this list. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Jon Rahm - $9,700 Harris English - $8,700 Bubba Watson - $8,300 Brendan Steele - $8,200 Webb Simpson - $7,900 J.J.

Here’s to a great 2018. Thank you to all sponsors @unisyscorp @RBC @United_Rentals @Columbia1938 @Titleist @JaniKingClean”  Whilst we don’t know the full extent, it appears Palmer is in a much better place off the course and if that is the case, then there is every chance the 3-time PGA Tour winner goes well here, on a course he has done everything but win at. At 125/1 I am more than happy to take a chance that his happiness off the course coupled with an improved putting performance, can see Palmer go low here and get the win his form in this event deserves.
Palmer  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign: First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2) Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33) Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18) Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25) Jim Furyk (T11-3) Robert Streb (WIN-T25) Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9) Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  Each week I think aloud to provide you with my One-and-Done selection as well as a few alternatives. Fade or Follow?
Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

GMac now moves on to a course where he has had a great amount of success with 5 top 15 finishes in his last 7 visits and at 80-1 I’m happy to take a chance that he can build on last week’s good work. DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016.
Bozzelli.  ->  positive

Bubba Watson also fits this narrative, as he will be fresh from the weekend and ready to attack a course which he’s demolished over his career. Other decent GPP targets include Anirban Lahiri (see below), Bud Cauley ($7,500), Harris English ($6,900) and Derek Fathauer ($6,500). Top Recent Form  1.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

At his peak Rory is a better DFS play than Spieth, regardless of venue, and I’d look for a bounce-back and possibly his first win of the year here after a very disappointing second major. Paul Casey ($9,700): Casey bombed on the weekend at the US Open, but there’s no knee high fescue at TPC River Highlands, and while Casey can sometimes struggle off the tee he’ll be penalised far less for that transgression here. He now ranks third in SG: Approaches and looked in fine form in that regards last week.
Casey  ->  positive

Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now. • • •  Alistair Tait  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

If we ignore Kaufman and Martin then the previous 4 winners all played poorly in Vegas the year before but owned a Top 15 finish from earlier in their careers. Huh fits that profile nicely as he missed the cut last year but had form figures of 28-30-13 from his first three efforts at TPC Summerlin. That on its own wouldn’t be enough but it was actually his total accuracy ranking of 10th over the last 3 months that alerted me to a possible turnaround.
Huh  ->  positive

He was runner-up on his very first Tour Championship appearance in 2013 and so far during the 2017 Playoffs he's finished second at both The Northern Trust and Dell Technologies Championship before closing with a 65 for tied seventh in last week's BMW Championship. Pacing himself is huge and Spieth admits he didn't get it right 12 months ago, the self-mismanagement revealing itself in a rather lacklustre T17 here at East Lake. Reflecting on that at the BMW, he said: "It's a grind physically and mentally.
Spieth  ->  positive

After missing the cut last week, Horschel comes at a nice discount, and in a field this soft, he's a strong bounce-back play this week. Jason Rouslin -- Stewart Cink ($6,900)  Stewart comes home to Sea Island Resort course off back-to-back 15th-place finishes. I'm sure spending time at home with his wife, who is battling cancer, and coming in with some great recent form will give him all the extra motivation he needs.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

In his third appearance at the AT&T last year, he placed T10, ranked T2 in par-5 scoring and led the field with four eagles. Matt Jones … The only consistency of his last two seasons has been inconsistency, but the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am has been a sanctuary. Appearing for the 11th consecutive year (and second straight on this page), the 37-year-old Aussie has registered two top 10s and another three top 25s, including in each of the last three editions.
Matt Jones  ->  positive

A great option in all fantasy formats this week. Rickie Fowler  Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff. The brightly-dressed California native returned last year to finish T4.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

He's 4th for Par 4 Birdie or Better Leaders and 33rd in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green while 8th for Driving Accuracy and 21st in Strokes Gained: Putting also bode well. Kaymer has finished in the top 16 for Greens In Regulation in five of his eight Sawgrass appearances so if he can pepper them again and cash in on his currently hot putter, a big title challenge beckons. I've been all around the houses trying to settle on a third pick.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Steve Rawlings takes a look at the local challengers at this week's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale...  “This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.“  Three of the first four in the Top GB & Ireland market are English - Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey - but it's now 25 years since an Englishman won the Open Championship so we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Rose, Casey, Fleetwood and their fellow compatriots, even if one of them, Fleetwood, is playing very close to home. Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose.
Rose,  ->  positive

My final selection is 23 year old world number 211 Michael Kim. A former amateur standout, Kim was voted the best collegiate golfer in America in 2013, generally a decent guide to future success as a pro if previous winners Justin Thomas, Russell Henley, Bill Haas, Ryan Moore and Kevin Chappell are anything to go by. Kim is a PGA Tour sophomore so his body of work is largely incomplete but on debut here last year, he fired a third round 66 on route to a 47th place finish, demonstrating an affinity for the course.
Kim.  ->  positive

With eight places on offer this week, he looks solid each-way value. Back Brendan Steele 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [10.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [5.0]    Next another chance for one of my US Open picks. Steele earned this column a profit at Erin Hills by hitting the lay target when briefly contending during the third round before falling back to 13th.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

While I don't think we need to pay up for List in cash games, I do think we need exposure in GPP formats and we should probably be overweight to the field. Jamie Lovemark  World Golf Ranking (#91)  Vegas Odds (45/1)  Draftkings ($7,700)  FanDuel ($10,000)  Lovemark's form has trended very similarily to List's in that he has bounced back in a big way after some early season struggles where he missed four straight cuts from November to January. Since then, he has made six straight cuts with a Top 10 at the Honda Classic and over his last five events is averaging 68 DraftKings points(5th in the field).
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

Possibly, but he's just 13/2, only performing in patches and, whilst acknowledging that he could win this by five, I'd rather have a punt on some bigger prices. One that I'm keen on is Daniel Berger at 55s. There's a well-quoted stat that every time the US PGA has followed the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, records show that the Wanamaker trophy had been in the top 22 at Firestone seven days earlier.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season. After a slow start at Firestone last week, Fowler fired rounds of 67/66 to climb inside the top-10 (9th), continuing his good form and hopefully taking momentum to Charlotte this week.
Fowler  ->  positive

He finished 14th on debut here in 2012 after opening up with a 64 but he missed the cut in 2014 and again last year, so he's very much a chancy pick. Selections:  Chesson Hadley @ [110.0]  Scott Stallings [120.0]  Trey Mullinax @ [170.0] & 150/1 (Sportsbook)    I'll be back later with my European Tour previews. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

He is also a veteran on Tour who can win and score well almost any week and on any course so we’ll use that knowledge to our advantage to gain an edge picking the bargain plays. Player to Avoid:  Justin Rose $9,700 – DISCLAIMER! We know Justin is a world-class player and week in and week out should not be a fade.
Justin  ->  negative

Selections    I've surprised myself and backed Adam Scott and I've taken a chance on four outsiders... I'm not convinced the venue's right for Smylie Kaufman but he's been catching the eye of late and he's one of few making his debut so I've had a small wager on him and I've also played Chris Kirk, D.A Points and John Huh. Kirk, who's a winner of the aforementioned RSM Classic, has played here only once before when he missed the cut in 2012 after a disastrous opening 78.
Kirk,  ->  positive

With 7 PGA Tour titles total in his first 4 seasons on the PGA Tour, Justin is undoubtedly a talented individual. To put Thomas' achievements in some form of context, Sergio Garcia has 10 PGA Tour titles to his name across a 16-year span. Others we see week in, week out at the top of the betting market include Justin Rose who has 8 PGA Tour titles, Hideki Matsuyama has 5 and Rickie Fowler has 4.
Thomas'  ->  positive

1pt each-way Chez Reavie at 66/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) Well rested since, this is a great opportunity for Reavie to gain his second tour win. His last four tournaments have produced finishes of 48-4-16-43 and he was in the top-10 going into the final round of the Travelers.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven’t guessed the name yet, I’m talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
Justin Thomas.  ->  negative

Tie that in with the aforementioned 5th at Harbour Town where he finished well in the worst of the Sunday conditions and Webb clearly has momentum. 21st here in 2011, 4th in 2012 and 2nd in 2015 on his home course, Simpson also finished a half-decent 33rd here at the PGA Championship after shooting a +5/76 to take himself right out of it on Thursday before producing -2/211 across his final 54 holes. All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays.
Webb  ->  positive

It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes. Over his past 24 events, Casey ranks first in SG:APP, SG: Par 4s, and 2nd in Bogey Avoidance. At $9,000 he is an extremely safe and reliable cash game cornerstone to build your lineup around.
Casey  ->  positive

If you make a tight tree-lined coastal course and then the winds whip up, rounds could get very ugly. The Top 10 Coastal Specialists:  Kelly Kraft (1.003 sg:coastal vs. 0.324 sg:total)  Patrick Rodgers (1.405 sg:coastal vs. 0.741 sg:total)  Rob Oppenheim (1.021 sg:coastal vs. 0.369 sg:total)  Martin Flores (1.357 sg:coastal vs. 0.727 sg:total)  John Daly (-0.867 sg:coastal vs. -1.426 sg:total)  Retief Goosen (1.228 sg:coastal vs. 0.705 sg:total)  Brendon Todd (0.516 sg:coastal vs. 0.115 sg:total)  Zac Blair (0.997 sg:coastal vs. 0.614 sg:total)  Brice Garnett (0.692 sg:coastal vs. 0.4 sg:total)  Fabian Gomez (0.686 sg:coastal vs. 0.425 sg:total)  Patrick Rodgers spent his college days at Stanford so perhaps that is where his love for coastal golf came to be. Kelly Kraft played at SMU, in windy Texas, which may tell us why he shines by the coast.
Retief  ->  positive

Poulter is among the elite in Shots Gained: Approach and Shots Gained: Scrambling this season which makes him a safe play and perfect for cash. Our VIP PGA Spreadsheet also shows that Poulter is gaining strokes on the field in Greens in Regulation, although it is great to have a good scrambler it is better if your players are hitting the greens in the first place and giving themselves birdie opportunities. I like Poulter for cash (especially on FanDuel) and think given his recent play he’s as close to a lock as we’ve got this week.
Poulter  ->  positive

Seven may have been enough picks but given how big the prices are on most of my original selections I'm going to bend the rules a little bit to get two more big outsiders in. Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

With the wind set to blow this week I am looking to stick with players who are proven in the wind or/and are renowned ‘ball strikers’ and Knox certainly ticks those boxes. Knox’s renowned ball striking strengths had dipped over the 2016/17 period but his 2018 stats show that he is back on track as he currently lies 38th in Driving Accuracy and 6th in GIR. All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.
Knox  ->  positive

A similar situation will likely occur this week as calm weather could see players approach the -25 Bubba Watson put up last season, while more wind will likely result in tamer scores. Last 5 winners  2015—Bubba Watson -25 (over Patrick Reed -22)  2014—Jordan Spieth -26 (over Henrik Stenson -16)  2013—Zach Johnson -13 (over Tiger Woods playoff)  2012—Graeme McDowell -17 (over Keegan Bradley -14)  2011—Tiger Woods -10 (over Zach Johnson -9)  Statistics  Driving Distance  Par 5 Scoring  This course is definitely a bit of an unknown in terms of how it will play, so I think being as simple as possible this week when looking at stats is a good idea. With the course set up as very wide open and pretty long Driving Distance will be a factor and would target those with length off the tee when possible.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Brendan Steele, $9600 – A perfect history of 7-of-7 made cuts including three top-6 finishes at Scottsdale, Steele is a flat-out bargain in a top-weighted field this week. Call it intuition but given Steele’s recent trip to the winner’s circle last October, it would be no surprise to see him closely contend for victory this week. The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price.
Brendan Steele,  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($9,600): Won here in his 2010 debut so he could use this as a nice springboard to get back into contention. Charley Hoffman ($10,900): Remarkable SEVEN top 15s in eight starts here at TPC San Antonio. Abraham Ancer ($6,900): Has called Texas home for much of his life.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two. Click To Enlarge!
Thomas  ->  negative

I love him at this price. Gary Woodland ($8,400) – Despite his exceptional performances outside of one MC at Phoenix, Gary continues to get no love from either the field or DK’s pricing algorithm, and I expect much of the same this week. He’s got his tee-to-green game completely lined up, his putting is reasonably strong, and there’s no reason to believe he won’t consider his top-20 lock status this week even in this field.
Gary  ->  positive

But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor. If you are going to tell me Brown is likely going to be highly owned at $9,800 when there are numerous options priced above and below him that are in better form, I will gladly fade Brown.
Brown  ->  negative

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Travelers Championship - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Bubba Watson 1.5pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Bubba Watson makes a lot of sense this week and with Day, McIlroy and Spieth all in the field, it's great to see 33/1 about the 2-time Travelers champion. Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
Chappell  ->  positive

Finally Huh has some eye catching progressively improving form at Copperhead with finishes of 33rd, 22nd and then 9th over the past three years, which gives further cause for optimism of a good week ahead. DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 31st  The mention of Bozzelli above leads me on nicely to my last selection of the week. Regular readers will know that I was on Bozzelli a couple of weeks ago at the Honda at the massive odds of 350-1.
Bozzelli  ->  positive

His win at the Tour Championship, where he held off Player of the Year, Justin Thomas was especially impressive and whilst this season has not yet lived up to expectations, a slight lull in form had to be expected. Just one missed cut this season suggests that, despite a struggle to reach the heights of last year, Schauffele can still grind out results without bringing his best stuff and with top-9 finishes at both the CIMB Classic (3rd) and the Genesis Open (T9) on the PGA Tour, as well as a T2 finish at the Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan, he is clearly still capable of flashing brilliance week-to-week. This event will be right up Xander’s street, with his distance off the tee a huge weapon when looking to overcome the long par 4’s and 5’s here.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation : 1) Greg Owen; 2) Luke List; 3) Peter Uihlein; 4) D.A.

Reavie has been playing good golf as of late making seven straight cuts, all within the top 50 including two majors with finishes of T16 (US Open) and T22 (PGA Championship). Reavie’s success has been coming from his Approach game, where he has been gaining just under a stroke a round once field adjusted. I like Reavie’s affordable price tag and see the ownership low enough to be playable in GPP’s well the floor is high enough he makes a great cash game play.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

I think the veteran has a good chance of making the cut, and at only $6,600, he is a nice GPP play that should come with a very low ownership this weekend. (5-8% via Fantasy Labs)  Matt Jones: (7,000) Jones is an inconsistent player, but he has been terrific here at Pebble Beach for his career, making 8/9 cuts with a T10 in 2010, a T15 in 2011, a T7 in 2015, and another T10 last season. He has had a decent start to this season making 2/4 cuts with a T36 last week at The Phoenix Open.
Matt Jones:  ->  positive

Byeong-hun An at 40/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - played well here for top-20 on debut; plenty of incentive to better it 1pt e.w. Ryan Palmer at 90/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - back-to-form top-10 last time; needs another big week to make Playoffs Click here for our transparent tipping record Henrik Stenson heads the betting for what looks a stock renewal of the Wyndham Championship, as many of the game's best take time out before the FedEx Cup Playoffs. Stenson is the chief exception and perhaps that's a nod to Sedgefield Country Club, the course which hosts this event for the 10th year in succession.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Again, I don't think we need to pay up at the top in cash games but he has a ton of upside and makes an excellent GPP play. Ryan Palmer  World Golf Ranking (#99)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($9,300)  It's been a long road for Palmer who not only had to deal with offseason surgery but personally had to deal with his wife's breast cancer diagnosis. He has been up and down in 2018 but has made three of fours cuts with the high being a T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
Palmer  ->  positive

He missed the cut at the Career Builder Challenge but either side of that disappointing effort he's finished sixth in the Sony and 12th in Phoenix. Two-time Sony winner, Jimmy Walker's course form is similarly poor and his figures read 38-MC-40-43-67-43 but it's noticeable that he's back for more and if we dig a little deeper it makes sense. He sat second behind Rickie at halfway last year and in his previous visit, in 2012, he sat fifth at halfway.
Jimmy Walker's  ->  positive

He is going to be popular as he is currently the top tagged golfer on FanShare but with his distance and all-around game, he is a top play in all formats. Stewart Cink  World Golf Ranking (#156)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($6,900)  FanDuel ($7,200)    Dipping down into the sub $7K range, we find Stewart Cink who ranks quite high in my stats model this week. While his SG: OTT ranks outside the Top 50, he averages about 294 yards off the tee and ranks 4th overall on the sheet in SG: APP.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

Jim Furyk – $9,100  This does not seem like Jim Furyk’s tournament to win, or even contend in. With all the bomber talk and Par 5 scoring requirements needed to compete, it’s shocking to see Furyk’s impressive course history. With that said, the Furyk we are seeing this year isn’t like years past.
Furyk  ->  negative

Other: Jason Day  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, Paul Casey, Kyle Stanley, Anirban Lahiri, Bud Cauley, Graham DeLaet, Byeong Hun-An  – Chez Reavie, David Lingmerth, Harris English, Derek Fathauer, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Tony Finau  Bets  Kyle Stanley 50-1  Harris English 100-1 EW  Anirban Lahiri 150-1 EW  Derek Fathauer 300-1 EW If the trend continues he’s a good enough putter to really take advantage on a course like this. Fathauer is a player capable of putting together some big rounds, and his approach game showed big improvement his last time out.
Anirban Lahiri,  ->  positive

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.

Weather Forecast : The latest weather forecast for Atlanta, Georgia is here .
Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

What stands out is his recent performances on poa annua/bentgrass greens with a win and a third in Riviera and Pebble Beach so that could be a big box ticked here. Johnson could overpower this venue ranking second in driving distance, third in GIR, 31st in SGP, 12th in par 4 scoring and 16th in par 5 scoring. With excellent current form and a razor sharp game DJ looks like the man to beat here.
DJ  ->  positive

There is no doubt in my mind that if he can have even an average week on the greens with his long game he can get in to the hunt and at 60-1 for a top 7 place I am winning to take a gamble this happens. RYAN MOORE – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 28th  I’ll be finishing my Masters staking plan with three 3 figure priced players and I’ll start these with Ryan Moore. Moore frustrated me just a few weeks when having eulogised over him in my preview for the Valspar he promptly missed the cut, before duly popping up with a top 5 next time out at Bay Hill.
RYAN MOORE  ->  positive

Of course he struggled over the weekend, shooting 74-72 to fall 24 places, however his play over the first two days here, after finishing T13 at the Honda Classic suggest he’s playing ok. PGA National is not a course you’d think would suit Pieters so that was a very promising result and whilst he disappointed at the Match Play last week, I think he can re-energise himself here. A T4 finish on debut at Augusta last year suggests Pieters could well like this test as well, and will be looking for confidence-building week as he returns to Augusta looking to emulate that success from 12 months ago. Even ahead of his debut at Augusta last year, Pieters’ form was up and down, finishing 2nd at the Genesis Open and 5th in Mexico either side of a MC at the Honda before also missing the weekend at Bay Hill.
Pieters  ->  positive

Noren comes here in much better form this time around and could be a huge danger man here. Thomas Pieters 35/1  The big hitting Belgian is playing some decent golf lately and after a great performance here last year, Chapultepec looks like it could really suit his game. Pieters has had a mixed bag of form over the last few months but there has been some decent stand out performances.
Pieters  ->  positive

At his low $7K price tag he is safe in all formats. Also Consider - Luke Donald  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Daniel Berger  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $6,900  FantasyAces - $4,900    A terrific stretch of golf that started back in March at the Cadillac Championship and saw Berger make 10 straight cuts and pick up his first career win at the St. Jude Classic. He was injured shortly after the win and was forced to withdraw from the Bridegestone Invitational which burnt a lot of people.
Berger  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Brooks Koepka – $7,700  What in the world is going on with Brooks Koepka. He has played terrible in his last two events and has reverted to snapping drivers in half to help solve his problems.
Brooks Koepka  ->  negative

If you like longshots, you have to like Harrington’s history on this course. Branden Grace - One golfer who has been flying under the radar a bit is Branden Grace, who has back-to-back top-25 finishes and hasn’t missed the cut once in his last five events. Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total. Roster the veteran in this weak field event.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Aggressive (3rd in Going for the Green) and potent on the par-5s (2nd in par-5 Birdie or Better), Koepka won at Erin Hills which played pretty-much to a PGA Championship format back in June. 5th at Whistling Straits in 2015 and 4th at Baltusrol last year summarise perfectly that Koepka's power-packed game is ideal for the PGA of America's premier title. What really sells his chances to me this week though are a few results on his CV that jump from off the page and his red-hot putter of late.
Koepka  ->  positive

He was in contention last week at Kapalua before finishing tied for ninth, where he also had a top-10 a year ago. Michael Collins: Spieth ($11,500)  Seeing as he's never played the Sony Open before, the term "ignorance is bliss" comes to mind. This type of course is completely opposite to what he played last week at Kapalua.
Spieth  ->  positive

If you can't quite see Tiger getting it done, a top 5 or top 10 punt could be a very good way of cheering him on. Last four events: 5-2-12-MC  Course form: 17-4-40-4-4-6-2-2-3-1  Last 10 majors: MC-MC-MC-17-MC-69-40-6-32-4  Last 50 starts - Win: 10%, Top 5: 26%, Top 10: 34%    Justin Rose - Place machine looks ready to play  "I really have positive and fond memories of last year. I hit a lot of great shots, and I don't feel like it was a tournament that anybody lost really," said Rose on Monday when reflecting on last year's play-off loss to Sergio Garcia.
Rose  ->  positive

At only $7,200 this week on DraftKings and $7,900 on FanDuel, we are getting a great deal of value and hoping to get him at lower ownership in GPPs. -- Jeff Bergerson  Phil Mickelson  On a course where scrambling and second shots matter, Phil is priced far too cheaply for his upside; it's a given that he'll end up in some odd spots off the tee from week to week, but Lefty is consistently one of the best around the greens and has been throughout his career. Mickelson has struggled to get through four full rounds this year, whether it's from mental lapses or physical exhaustion (he's old), so that will be a concern -- but he's also excellent in approach shots, an elite putter who puts up a ton of daily fantasy points with his great birdie average, and he's near the top in scoring on par 5s.
Phil  ->  positive

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 5 Winners:  2016: Rory McIlroy (-12)  2015: Jordan Spieth (-9)  2014: Billy Horschel (-11)  2013: Henrik Stenson (-13)  2012: Brandt Snedeker (-10)  NOTE: ONLY ONE PREVIOUS WINNERS IS IN THE FIELD (Jordan Spieth 2015)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Bogey Avoidance Par 4 Scoring GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Jordan Spieth ($11,600)  This weeks core will consist of just three names. Why am I doing that?
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail. The Olympic champion has returned from the back injury that dogged him at the back end of last season in decent form.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week. Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event. It wasn’t to be for Rose that week though as he limped to a disappointing 48th place finish, much below his usual high standards.
Rose  ->  positive

The Swede is looking for his first victory since winning The Open last summer. Taras Pitra: Kevin Kisner ($7,600)  When looking at Kisner's stats, it's amazing to me that he hasn't won yet. What's even more surprising to me is how he has managed only two top-10s in five events.
Kisner  ->  positive

Others: Luke List  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, JB Holmes, Patrick Cantlay, Gary Woodland, Kevin Tway, Ollie Schniederjans, Ricky Werenski  – Bubba Watson, Anirban Lahiri, Scott Stallings, Luke List, Robert Garrigus, Chad Campbell  Bets:  JB Holmes 45-1  Scott Stallings 80-1  Anirban Lahiri 80-1 EW  Kevin Tway 75-1 EW  Luke List 200-1 EW He was top five in both SG: Off the Tee and Approaches at the Barbasol, and with 41 birdies and three eagles over his last two starts is a great tournament target this week. Scott Stallings ($7,500): Stallings has been playing out of his mind the past two weeks and given that Glen Abbey lines up nicely—in terms of ease of setup—with the venues at his past two starts we probably shouldn’t look past the three-time Tour winner in DFS.
Matt Kuchar,  ->  positive

On top of his excellent putting stats, Harman ranks 19th in both Scrambling and Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green which I feel are important this week. Harman also ranks 11th in Par 4 Scoring Average and T24 in Par 4 Performance, again impressive statistics ahead of this week. On top of this all Harman finished T5 at this event at Bethpage Black in 2012 and impressed again four years later, finishing T22 at the same course and event.
Harman  ->  positive

Statistically Fowler ranks 49th in Strokes Gained Off-The-Tee and 14th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green which are two of the key areas this week. Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season.
Fowler  ->  positive

People will be hesitant to play Spieth, despite being the third highest priced player, because of his poor recent form and with Augusta looming right around the corner. There is no doubt Spieth needs a huge week to gain momentum for the next week to throw his name in the ring as the betting favorites alongside Tiger and Rory. This is the last week he has to make a splash, and no one would be shocked if in two weeks time, Spieth has won back-to-back events.
Spieth,  ->  positive

You will see me reference these in my articles and videos. Top Course History Targets  Bubba Watson  World Golf Ranking (#40)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,500)  Over the course of one's career, no one has dominated TPC River Highlands quite like Bubba. He missed the cut here in his first trip back in 2006, skipped the 2007 event and has not only made the cut in nine straight years since but has won twice('10/'15) with five total Top 10 finishes.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Johnson has finished inside the top-23 in six of his seven starts this season, with the T57 finish at the Phoenix Open the exception. This suggests Johnson’s game is in very good shape, and an improvement in one area could be the difference on any given week. Zach has always been known for his short-game and in particular his putting, but so far this season he currently ranks just 81st in Strokes Gained: Putting, and should he find his touch on the greens, a win could be on the horizon.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

QED! Exchange Betting  My pre-tournament strategy for this year is more or less unchanged and I’ve layed the following players:  All players priced 50/1 or shorter, with the exception of: Rose, Spieth, Bubba & Garcia;  All course rookies (eg Schauffele, Frittelli, Finau, Li);  All Augusta non-performers (eg Noren, Reed, Kaymer, Fleetwood, Hatton) and;  Most players with two or more missed cuts this year (eg Fowler, Poulter, Oosthuizen, DeChambeau, Kisner). Finally, if you like a bit of back-to-lay exchange action, my top two to poke their noses onto the leaderboard at some stage are:  Brendan Steele (330.00) who was 27th in his second Augusta start last year and who hasn’t missed a cut since August and;  Kiradech Aphibarnrat (160.00) who was 15th in his only Augusta start (2016) and who has been playing well in top company this year (5th WGC Mexico & quarter-finalist WGC Dell Matchplay.
Spieth,  ->  positive

The win still eludes him but his high-class consistency is appealing to fantasy managers. Tyrrell Hatton  Hatton was in the middle of a golden spell last year when a T10 here was the Mexican filling sandwiched between Florida T4s at the Honda and Bay Hill. He missed the cut at PGA National last week but prior to that was third in Abu Dhabi (3rd GIR) and let’s remember that he’s the World No.
Hatton  ->  negative

Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse. Looking at my sheet, there are only two other golfers in the $7,500+ range who have scored less DraftKings points per tournament(41) than Rahm.
Rahm  ->  negative

Maybe he is looking for some guidance this week, whatever it is, I really do believe Horschel can bounce back from the missed cut last week, with a huge week here at Bay Hill. Brooks Koepka 100/1 (StanJames 6 places + Betway, William Hill and Ladbrokes) 0.5pt e/w:  From one golfer who needs some help to another, I also think Brooks Koepka is worth a bet at the same price as Horschel. Koepka has been in dismal form in 2017, finishing no better than his T42 at the Phoenix Open so far, so why am I backing him this week?
Koepka  ->  positive

Harman wasn’t great last week at the Genesis Open, but he does have five top-25 finishes in 10 events and has made the cut seven times. Harman has produced four of those top-25 finishes in his last five events overall. Also, Harman shot a 61 in the second round of the 2012 Honda Classic, which is a course record, so he does have some history on this course and a great feel for things.
Harman  ->  positive

Last year DJ beat Rahm in the final match to take the trophy. Other winners include Jason Day (2016 and 2014), Rory (2015), Kuchar (2013) and Ian Poulter (2010). I’m not harping too much on the course because this is match play.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Henry is fully exempt this season by virtue of the last spot via the FedExCup points list in 2016-17.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Rickie Fowler $10,500 – Fowler is the one guy out of the top four on DraftKings we just can’t roster. You can make great cases for the other three up top (all previous winners here), but Fowler’s inability to close in strong fields like this is concerning. We mentioned that you have to roster the winner this week.
Fowler  ->  negative

In 2017 he ranked 15th in par-four scoring, 17th in three-putt avoidance and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green. Pat Perez - $14,500    Much like Leishman, Perez is another veteran coming off a career year in 2017 after winning the CIMB Classic to go along with six total top-10s. The 41-year-old finished T3 at this past year’s Tournament of Champions, while he’s posted no finish worse than a T34 in his last nine starts.
Leishman,  ->  positive

Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win. He has made six straight cuts with five Top 25 finishes including a T5 last week at the Travelers Championship.
Reed  ->  positive

His form figures here read 43-73-2-31-14 and he caught the eye last week when a fast finishing 11th. Selections:  Jason Day @ [26.0]  Jhonattan Vegas [70.0]  Charley Hoffman @ [75.0]  Harris English @ [110.0]    I'm taking a bit of time off this weekend so Paul Krishnamurty is going to cover the In-Play Blog and De-brief and I'll be back with the previews again next week. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

They were paired together in one of the two pairs matches and won 3&2. Henley is having an excellent season and his last three starts show a win at the Houston Open, T11 at the Masters and T26 in The Heritage. He played the weather-shortened 2016 Zurich Classic and shot 69-73-68 for T36.
Henley  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Kyle Stanley; 2) Ryan Armour / Russell Henley / Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Chez Reavie; 7) Jordan Spieth; 8) Colt Knost / William McGirt; 10) Kevin Na; 11) Austin Cook; 12) Ben Martin; 13) Steve Wheatcroft; 14) Kevin Kisner; 15) Justin Thomas; 16) Tyler Duncan / J.J.

Marc Leishman;  ->  positive

He’s one of the best ball strikers on tour as he’s currently 14th in Greens in Regulation. Honorable Mention: Adam Scott ($8,500) & Francesco Molinari ($7,300)  Could Sergio Garcia prove to be this weekend’s top option? Read Now  Going Against The Green  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Around the Green  Scrambling  Par 5 Birdie or Better  An argument can be made that either Jon Rahm ($11,400) or Rickie Fowler ($9,200) has been the second-best golfer this season, behind Dustin Johnson.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course. It's no wonder he has a stellar track record in major championships.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Choi    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth, $19,800    It’s clear Spieth and Justin Thomas are the cream of this week’s crop, but Spieth comes with a higher salary due to his strong finish last week at Kapalua. Spieth possesses all the course management and iron game necessary to slay this course, and with a third-place effort last season, he’ll be hungry for more this time around. Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

Whilst he finished 11th at Phoenix the week before this event last year, he had just missed the cut at Torrey Pines. This time he has been much more consistent, finishing T14 at Torrey before his T16 last week, so I am full of confidence once again, that Mickelson can get his first win since the 2013 Open Championship. Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events. He’s a great value buy.
Robert Garrigus  ->  positive

Check the bottom of the PGATour Launch Angle statistics. The Golfers  The Core  Ollie Schniederjans ($7700): The aforementioned Ollie Schniederjans, he of the low launch angle and ball height, makes a great play this week for many reasons beyond his play in the wind – he’s had good finishes this season at both RBC Heritage (T3) and the Valero Texas Open (T18) which are good comparable courses, and is coming in off four straight made cuts. Ollie sits 21st in Strokes Gained: Approach, and is excellent at getting close to the pin from both the fairway (14th) and the rough (17th); prox from the rough will have an impact this week given how tight the fairways are.
Ollie  ->  positive

Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price.
Leishman  ->  positive

There are six Par-4’s between 450-500 yards here at Riviera, and with Reavie averaging 290 yards off the tee this season, his approaches from 150-175 and 175-200 yards this week will be important. Reavie ranks 7th and 9th in approaches from the fairway in these two ranges respectively, further supporting his case this week. Whilst there are obvious question marks about whether Reavie can win, especially in this company, his game is in perfect shape to play this course.
Reavie  ->  positive

That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine. With a best of tied 4th at the Texas Open this season, it’s been a disappointing campaign but there have been signs in the last couple of weeks that Horschel may finally be springing into life. He followed up a tied-5th showing at the Wyndham Championship with another top 20 at The Barclays on the fiendishly difficult Bethpage Black.
Horschel  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
Tommy  ->  positive

Fitzpatrick is first out on the 10th tee on Thursday, playing with Brandon Harkins and former winner of this event, Robert Gamez so he will get the best of the greens, making him an intriguing option as First Round Leader, an honour he shared with Emiliano Grillo last season. Tom Jacobs – Sam Horsfield to finish inside the top-20 (8/1)  Still just 21, it feels like Sam Horsfield’s name has been bounded around forever but that is because Ian Poulter has been gushing about the young Englishman’s ability for years. Horsfield was born in England but raised in Orlando, near Poulter’s home and educated at the University of Florida, so this is still somewhat of a home event for a man who has been plying his trade on the European Tour this season.
Sam Horsfield  ->  positive

Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned.
Spieth  ->  positive

As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out!
Glover’s  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy - $11,800 (7-1)    One way for Spieth to relieve some of that pressure was to say that McIlroy is the favorite. That's smart of Spieth, and calculating, but also probably true. McIlroy has won at Quail Hollow twice with six top-10s in seven career starts there.
Spieth  ->  positive

Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He also finished T5 at the Sanderson Farms Championship so there are plenty of positives if you go far enough back. 1pt each-way Xander Schauffele at 150/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds)  For my final selection, I’m going with another Web.com Tour graduate in the shape of JJ Spaun. The 26-year-old has been much more prominent on the PGA Tour this season.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Also Consider - Harold Varner III  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Trey Mullinax  Vegas Odds - 200/1  Draftkings - $6,500  FantasyAces - $4,000    I love taking a rookie in this spot as he will most likely be extremely low owned. Oh ya and Mullinax has a tremendous amount of talent and through watching interviews, seems to have it together between the ears. PGA Tour pro Michael Thompson, who had the same college coach, went as far as to say Mullinax's raw power is best compared to Dustin Johnson.
Mullinax  ->  positive

His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first-round withdraws to his history, he hasn't missed the cut here going back to 2008. -- Adam Daly  Patrick Cantlay  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I am going to keep going back to Cantlay until his price rises to the point to where I have a decision to consider. At $7,800 on DraftKings, below the average salary, this is still an easy plug-and-play pick in the lower range for a player who has yet to miss a cut on the season, has shown elite ball striking ability and is not bad with the flat stick.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
Dufner  ->  positive

He also co-led in fairways hit and ranked T9 in greens in regulation and seventh in proximity to the hole. Chez Reavie … No shift in this narrative, really. He's 7-for-8 since New Orleans with a T4 in Memphis and a T16 at the U.S. Open.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Seven may have been enough picks but given how big the prices are on most of my original selections I'm going to bend the rules a little bit to get two more big outsiders in. Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

That strong Sunshine State form spills over to other venues throughout the course of his career. The WGC at Doral has seen McDowell finish 6th (2010), 3rd (2013) and 9th (2014). Go back 13 years to 2005 and Graeme's breakout PGA Tour performance came at Bay Hill where he finished 2nd to Kenny Perry.
Graeme's  ->  positive

Salary Vs. Vegas Odds  While I don’t suggest making decision based purely on Vegas Odds when it comes to golf, I think it’s a useful way to determine where you might find golfers with unexpected value. The first standout this week comes in the form of Lucas Glover who’s odds are roughly 100:1 to win despite the fact that Glover will cost you only $6,600 towards the salary cap to get him in your lineups. Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play.
Glover  ->  positive

After three great rounds last week in route to a seventh-place finish, Leishman is primed for success on a course where he’s a perfect 8-for-8 in made cuts. Brian Harman, $11,300 – Despite a huge increase in salary compared to last week, Harman still shakes out as a good value on a course tailor made for his game. Harman has finished no worse than T20 in the past three years, so expect the lefty precision player to convert plenty of birdies and continue his good form.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley 80/1 (Skybet 7 places 1/5, SportingBet 5 places 1/4) 1pt e/w:  Much like Reavie, Bradley is a great statistical fit for the event, what’s more, he has course form to boot. In seven starts at Riviera, Bradley has as many top-4 finishes as he does missed cuts (2), and also has two other top-20 finishes to add to the collection. Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup.
Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

Put it all together and lineups that are heavy on the chalk (raising my hand) are not as likely to contend for the weekly title as gamers who blend surprise contenders with strong games off the tee. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Waste Management Phoenix Open (in alphabetical order):  Tony Finau  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  Webb Simpson  Jordan Spieth  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks.

Tony Finau  ->  positive

Henley gets it done in most of our key stats, ranking 13th in BA, 24th in BoB%, 13th in Par 4 Scoring, and 14th in Par 3 Scoring. If there was a course made to fit Henley's game, it would be this one. Henley also ranks 8th in putting 15-25' and 2nd in Round 1 Scoring.
Henley's  ->  positive

With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua. He can go lights out on and around the greens which is often crucial on a coastal course.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips. He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events.
Campbell  ->  positive

On his promotion to the PGA Tour this autumn, Spaun acclimatised slowly to the higher level, but his best result by far came at El Camaleon where he finished 28th and he showed his liking for Paspalum greens by topping the Putts per GIR category that week. Harold Varner III 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  There's a massive difference of opinion over Harold Varner III this week with Paddy Power and Betfair pricing him as short as 35/1. The very early 80/1 in the market has rightfully been snapped up, but with the price history of this event 66/1 with HV3 is not a bad place to be this week.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

The standouts on this chart are a bit less obvious this week which is interesting considering the pricing seems to have been adjusted a bit and is much less soft than we’ve seen over the past month or so. This week however, there seems to be some potential value in Brooks Koekpa, Danny Willett, and Soren Kjeldsen, all of whom find themselves seriously underpriced given their world rankings. Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR.
Soren Kjeldsen,  ->  positive

Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event. This time around, he’s up to a career-best 11th in the OWGR and has finished top-six five times in his last six starts.
Johnson  ->  positive

He’s 23rd in the key 150-175 yard range though which will be a key range this week, and it makes it easy to ignore his overall Greens in Regulation number of 65.28% (109th). With a severe lack of distance off the tee, Poulter’s overall OTT numbers don’t seem appealing (142nd in SG: OTT, 168th in Distance), but Poulter is very accurate (64.03% of fairways hit). If Poulter struggles on approach, he’s currently 11th in Scrambling and 3rd in SG: Around the Green overall – with a cut line below E, Bogey Avoidance will be more important than normal, and Scrambling (as shown above) plays a huge part in avoiding squares.
Poulter’s  ->  positive

Casey finished 16th in the WGC Mexico Championship and he placed 11th in this year’s Honda Championship played at Fazio-designed PGA National. Casey is rarely going to make the most birdies in the field for a week, but what he will do is prevent disaster as he ranks 14th in bogey avoidance. He has a great tee-to-green game, ranking 16th on tour, and also ranks 21st in SG:App.
Casey  ->  positive

He started the new year off on a positive note finishing T8 at The Sony Open last week shooting a superb 61 in the final round to post 16 under par in total. Reavie has played well here in the past with three top 25’s in six appearances. He finished fifth in 2008, 22nd in 2012 and T17 last year.
Reavie  ->  positive

His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
Holmes  ->  positive

Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk. He won here in 2014 and is 4-for-4 otherwise at TPC Boston, all inside the top 35.
Chris Kirk,  ->  positive

Taking advantage of the four easiest holes at Augusta is, as mentioned, really important and while par-five performance has long been something of an issue for Haas, there's evidence to suggest he's getting to grips with this particular set. Finally, for one at such a price and without a major in the bag, Haas does have a heck of a lot of top-level form including his 2011 FedEx Cup success, which came here in Georgia, and three Presidents Cup appearances which he's desperate to add to with a fourth at Liberty National later this year. He's also won at Riviera and Congressional, two classical layouts with more than a passing resemblance to Augusta and form ties too, and I'm increasingly sweet on the idea that Haas could follow his great-uncle Bob Goalby and win the Masters.
Haas,  ->  positive

Read Now  Going Against The Green  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Around the Green  Scrambling  Par 5 Birdie or Better  An argument can be made that either Jon Rahm ($11,400) or Rickie Fowler ($9,200) has been the second-best golfer this season, behind Dustin Johnson. Jon Rahm is $2,000 more than Fowler, though. Rahm is definitely longer off the tee and is slightly more accurate on approach.
Fowler  ->  positive

With five straight top-8 finishes which include four top-5’s, it is now time for Harman to capitalise on some special form. Harman has made huge strides as a player over the last couple of years and whilst his win at the Wells Fargo was just his second on the PGA Tour, and his first for three years, he now looks ready to become a perennial winner on Tour. The potential has been there ever since Harman was an amateur winning multiple times, as well as playing on winning Palmer and Walker Cup teams.
Harman  ->  positive

He was matched at [690.0] in-running and he was quoting as saying "I quite simply had nothing out there" after round one so Tommy did well to close with rounds of 67 and 66 to climb up to 14th given no other Honda contenders shone. In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

In winning last year, Thomas was third in driving distance, third in proximity and first in putting average. Jordan Spieth - $10,900 (6-1)    Spieth has played this tournament three times and finished in the top-3 every time. He won here two years ago with a whopping 30-under total, eight shots clear of the field.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Under $7,000, the trio of Seamus Power, Robert Garrigus and Richy Werenski (see below) all make for nice punt plays as well. MY PICK : J.B. Holmes ($8,500)  It’s been an up and down year for JB but there’s some reason to think that a big finish to 2017 might be coming for the veteran. Not only does Holmes come into the Canadian Open on the back of five straight made cuts, but he’s also recorded two of his best finishes on the year over that span as well.
Holmes  ->  positive

(This video is available to Pro subscribers on our Premium Content Portal.) One of this week’s matches for Levitan’s trend is Lucas Glover, who has missed three of his last four cuts. Even though he is not in great form, Glover is one of the best golfers in this field: He is tied for ninth with his 69.3 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) and third overall with his 69.4 percent LT Greens in Regulation (GIR).
Lucas Glover,  ->  positive

If you are going stars and scrubs, Dufner is your guy. Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere  Paul Casey – $9,500  Casey is another guy, like Adam Scott, who has stepped it up come playoff time. He has back-to-back 2nd place finishes coming into the Tour Championship, and got a significant price increase because of that.
Casey  ->  positive

Koepka and Thomas are a new breed of golfer that can leave any rival feeling extremely intimidated and could conceivably have the rest trailing in their wake if they turn on the turbo boost in current mood. Rickie Fowler and Justin Rose both arrive in decent nick and are among the market leaders too but I am going to take an each-way punt on Kevin Kisner at much bigger odds for his debut at a venue which should be right up his street. The Georgia Bulldog is very much my player to follow next year and although he may not be blessed with some of the physical gifts bestowed on Koepka or DJ, he makes up for that with the mental resolve that can make him a regular winner at the top level.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

With long rough and a straightforward layout, it is going to be accuracy and consistent ball-striking with all your irons that lead to success here. And with greens predicted to be relatively fast, a putter like Spieth always has an advantage, and I like him to start off the playoffs with a big performance here. Henrik Stenson ($9,800) – A player at his best avoiding the big mistakes and making pars, Stenson is coming off a win last weekend at the Wyndham Championship in which he scored 62-66-66-64, and proved he can make birdies when the opportunity presents itself.
Spieth  ->  positive

Couple that with a dozen straight made cuts, and he’s in play this weekend. Fade: Some people may be willing to jump back onto Patrick Reed ($9,100), but I’ll pass after he lost strokes everywhere in Pebble Beach a few weeks ago. Value Golfers ($8,000 – $7,000)  Chesson Hadley ($7,700) is number one in my model this week, which factors in relevant Par 3, Par 4, and Par 5 distances in addition to Proximity and DraftKings Scoring.
Patrick Reed  ->  negative

This is very similar to the form he had shown in his first two starts at the Byron Nelson and hopefully he can improve on the 13th place finish he managed there two starts ago. Finau is a player of immense quality and it is just a matter of time before he adds to his lone PGA Tour victory, that he landed in Puerto Rico last season. From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th).
Finau  ->  positive

However 10th at Glen Oaks, 10th at TPC Boston on a layout he struggles on and 2nd last week at Conway Farms highlights that Rose has momentum that only Spieth and Rahm can match. Whilst I wonder about Rahm on Bermudagrass greens, I have no hesitation in adding Rose to my betting slip this week as his record at the strategic East Lake is excellent. Jordan Spieth in his comments above notes that he thinks East Lake and Augusta have the same feel and twice Augusta runner-up Rose has finished 2nd (2012), 6th (2013), 4th (2014) and 2nd (2015) on his last 4 visits to the Tour Championship.
Rose  ->  positive

Bet £10 Get £60 free here:  I'll finish with Jonas Blixt who's at an attractive price this week. 36th in Total Eagles, 50th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 72nd in par-4 and 81st in par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion are statistics I really like for Coco Beach and it's worth remembering that Blixt has contended at the highest level across The Masters (2nd 2014) and PGA Championship 4th (2013) in the past. There have been signs this year of better times ahead - 5th at Torrey Pines after 54 holes, 11th after shooting 64 in Round 2 at TPC Scottsdale - and Blixt has certainly re-invigorated his top notch putting in recent appearances.
Blixt  ->  positive

Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events. He’s a great value buy.
Garrigus  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Peter Uihlein: Come on dude, just get over to the PGA Tour already. Since coming back from injury on the European Tour, Uihlein has been tearing it up, and his success translated quite well last week, putting him pretty close to contention for the win. He’s very, very talented and could be a force if he decides to make the Brooks Koepka transition back to the states.
Peter Uihlein:  ->  positive

While this is as good as it gets in these tournaments, I feel like the obvious choice has been faltering over the last few tournaments with sure bets landing into the 30-50th in the standings. B:  Patrick Reed - Currently 1st in the FedEx rankings, Patrick had a very strong start, faltered a bit in the middle but now has had top 15 finishes in 5 out of 6 tournaments. He finished 4th at TPC Boston last year.
Patrick  ->  positive

- current odds here . My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 2.5pts EW 14/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Rickie Fowler is a true course specialist who has a fantastic chance of winning his 5th PGA Tour title this week. Asked about his thoughts on TPC Scottsdale 12 months ago after he finished 2 shots behind Hideki Matsuyama and Webb Simpson, Rickie answered, "Yeah, nice to do that after missing the cut last week.
Rickie  ->  positive

The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat. Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue.
Summerhays  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Bill Haas $8,600 – “What Tour Junkies…?! How do you avoid Haas when he’s gained 40 strokes on the field at this event in the last 5 years?” Well, it’s because those strokes were gained on the front end of that five-year term and Haas has shown none of that ability recently. Haas is the epitome of a plodder.
Haas  ->  negative

Stenson said he would be heading to Birkdale, in the northwest of England, on Sunday evening. "You never know, it might be the only time we're defending champion at the Open Championship so I might as well enjoy it," Stenson said. "I think that's going to be the most important thing coming into an event like that, not feeling that you're playing anywhere near 100 percent," he added.
Stenson  ->  negative

Abraham Ancer ($8,000 | 50) - Ancer finished 41st in his debut at Puntacana last year, so at least he knows the course. Ancer enters with a 52nd at the WGC-Mexico and a 16th at the Valspar, so that alone puts him on the radar. He's also 8th in approach, 9th on par 5s, and 16th in birdie or better rate over the past 50 rounds.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

He looks like a great bargain this week at under $9K. MY SLEEPER : Kevin Tway ($7,000)  Tway came close to getting his first win on tour last season but ultimately fell short in a couple spots. He’s started 2018 slowly but has come on over the past month or so and is on a four-event made-cut streak entering the Valero this year.
Tway  ->  positive

22 East Asia appearances have generated 8th at the 2013 BMW Masters, 8th at the 2014 Volvo China Open and 2nd last time Rafael visited the area at last year's Hong Kong Open at Fanling. RESULT: T11  Cameron Smith 1pt EW 45/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Young Aussie sensation Cameron Smith has to be a danger this week. Equally adept at grinding or reeling off par-breakers, the 24 year-old from the Gold Coast must be full of confidence after his second top-5 finish at TPC Kuala Lumpur last week and at a course in South Korea that nobody has competitive knowledge of, his experience on the Asian Tour puts him in good stead.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little.

1pt each-way Kyle Stanley at 200/1 Sky Bet (7 places; 1/4 odds) Stanley won’t be able to win on ball-striking alone but there are signs of improvement on the greens. A course record of MC-33-71 is slightly underwhelming but he finished T5 on the adjacent Dye’s Valley course in the 2015 Web.com Tour Championship.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

He rates in the top 25% of the field in Scrambling and has previous course form with a runner up finish back in 2011. What piques our interest most is that Stanley tends to be a man who holds his form very well. He has three top 6 finishes in his last 6 events and his last PGA Tour victory was off the back of a runner up finish demonstrating that when his game gets hot, he stays in the groove.
Stanley  ->  positive

Paul Casey and Thomas Pieters  Golf expert Ben Coley tipped the 200/1 runner-up in last year's WGC-Mexico Championship, and has two selections in a bid to go one better this week. What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, Tommy Fleetwood completed his transformation to elite level with a runner-up finish in the WGC-Mexico Championship, forcing Dustin Johnson to pull out all the stops as he won on his first start as the world's top-ranked player.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Players like DJ, Bubba Watson, Martin Laird, Ben Crane and Hunter Mahan further underscore ties between leaderboards and that leads me back to Harris English. English plays Torrey Pines really well and was part of the four-man play-off won by Day there in 2015. In fact, most of his best form on the PGA Tour has come at connecting tracks: he’s won the OHL Classic in Mexico and the FedEx St Jude in Memphis, twice gone close at Colonial, and twice gone close in the Sony Open.
English.  ->  positive

Grillo did also get to -16 at one stage, which was one better than the two that contested the play-off, but a back-9 41 led to a final round 74, which ultimately cost him. In the end Grillo finished T11 last season, which was a stellar attempt on debut and now with a year of experience under his belt alongside some good current form, he looks a good bet to go better this time around. Kyle Stanley 100/1 (Betfred & StanJames 6 places ¼ odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Statistically, Kyle Stanley is a dream fit for me this week so to leave him out at 100/1 would make no sense.
Grillo  ->  positive

Lock and load in all formats. Jhonattan Vegas  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($8,700)  It is a bit of a home game for Vegas this week as he attended the University of Texas just two hours down the road. Looking over a quote from last year(via Future of Fantasy Golfanac), Vegas is clearly comfortable playing here and it shows with the results recently as he has T15 and T19 in his last two trips to the Houston Open.
Vegas  ->  positive

Garcia’s 67.8 Recent Adj Rd Score is tied for fourth, his 72.6 percent Recent GIR is 15th, and his 16.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for 11th in this week’s field. Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide.
Hatton  ->  positive

However, decisions need to be made and a quick elimination process is that DJ isn't playing to the same levels as he was last year, Jordan Spieth isn't quite on it, Justin Thomas has an iffy record in this event and in Texas while McIlroy may just be a little short in the betting at 7/1 given that he can still throw in a flat round. Jason Day loves this format and shook some rust off last week but I'm going to plump for last year's runner-up, Jon Rahm, as my main pick. Rahm ran into a player, Johnson, at the very peak of his powers in the final 12 months ago but still took him to the 17th hole.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

Other Picks to Consider  Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100): One of the finest ball-strikers on TOUR, it will come down to his flat stick on whether he contends this week. Rickie Fowler ($10,000): Looking at the glass half-full, we can take a lot of good from last week's T7 at The Barclays. Despite stumbling down the stretch, he put himself right in the mix, which is more than he's been doing for the past few months.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Picks to win (for the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play event)  Jordan Spieth  Here's banking on Spieth deriving some motivation from being back in his college town, but even more from the who's who list of fellow elite players who already have won this year before the Masters. -- Jason Sobel  Spieth  There's got to be some extra motivation for Spieth at this point, given his struggles of late and all the big names winning around him. The three-time major winner missed the cut at the Valspar Championship and won't have it easy in his match-play group with Haotong Li, Charl Schwartzel and his Ryder Cup pal Patrick Reed, and that will make for must-see Friday viewing.
Spieth  ->  positive

It's hard to trust any rookie in cash games early in the season but Gribble is definitely a high ceiling GPP play this week . Alex Cejka  World Golf Ranking (134)  Vegas Odds (81)  Draftkings ($8,300)  FantasyAces ($4,950)    I am going to ignore the price this week as Cejka is normally a high $6K, low $7K priced player. The field is much weaker than normal so the price adjustment makes sense, especially with Cejka coming back top TPC Summerlin after a T2 last year and T18 the year before.
Cejka  ->  positive

The other surprise name here is Nick Taylor, which tells us as much as we need to know about the strength of this event. Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.
Zach Johnson  ->  negative

Rahm has ranked number one for Birdie Average on the PGA Tour over the last six months (averaging an impressive 4.62) and this set-up looks absolutely perfect for such a talented and aggressive birdie machine. Rahm may be playing the event for the first time but his new caddie, Adam Hayes, knows the venue well. He was on Jonathan Byrd's bag when he won here in 2010 in dramatic style.
Rahm  ->  positive

I'm not expecting another top-5, but anything inside the top 12 is reasonable and you'll probably need him to finish high in GPPs this week. -- Taras Pitra  Webb Simpson  In his four appearances at East Lake, Simpson has been able to finish in the top 5 twice. Since he changed his putter this season, he has been a much improved player and has three top-10 finishes in his past four events played.
Simpson  ->  positive

If we’re going to go against the grain this week, we can target par 5 scorers and some of the longer hitters off the tee. Going With The Grain  Good Drive Percentage  Par 4 and 5 Scoring  Greens in Regulation  Jordan Spieth ($11,400) suffered a bit of a hiccup during THE PLAYERS Championship and the AT&T Byron Nelson, missing both cuts, but has found form recently. He has finished no worse than 35th in his past three starts.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  negative

Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
Thomas  ->  negative

He’s more of a GPP play this week as I believe there are safer cash options, but he’s an elite GPP play. Jordan Spieth ($11000)  His game hasn’t been at his best this year, but these are the type of events he really brings the best of his game out in. Spieth’s been M.I.A.
Spieth  ->  positive

There is evidence over the years that aggressive bomber types are rewarded at the Golf Club of Houston with past winners JB Holmes, Mickelson, Kim and Casey all falling in that category and therefore it no surprise that List has played well here over the past two years and I am confident he has another big week ahead of him this week. KEEGAN BRADLEY – 55-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finshed 43rd  Keegan Bradley has been knocking on the door of a comeback win for a while now and I can see him having another big showing this week. The former PGA Champion is one of many of the games bigger names who need to win this week to make the field for the Masters and he should feel hopeful of delivering at a venue which he has had plenty of success at in the past.
Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

At an event where he thrives on the atmosphere and the fact that his family attend, I can't ignore the World Number 7 this week. RESULT: T11  Justin Thomas 2pts EW 16/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I'm going for a two-pronged approach at the top of the market with Justin Thomas backing up Rickie Fowler. With in-your-face form hardly a guaranteed indicator of the champion here, Thomas has started the year with understated 22nd and 14th place finishes across the Aloha swing.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

But his price tag is a huge deterrent. Tiger Woods – $8,200  This is going to become repetitive if Tiger doesn’t start getting priced fairly. $8,200 is a steep price to pay for Woods, who is coming off of an ugly missed cut at Riviera.
Tiger Woods  ->  negative

In other words, players who don’t pop up all that often. Rose also happens to be one of the golfers whose opinion really counts and, like Lingmerth, he’s both won at Jack’s place and gone close several times here, fading to ninth last year, finishing runner-up to Woods in 2013 and third behind Laird in 2011. As you might expect, all three performances came courtesy of Rose’s trademark tee-to-green play and there’s been nothing wrong on that score this year, as he ranks first in strokes-gained off the tee and highly in all the relevant long-game tables, while also having putted pretty well in the main.
Rose  ->  positive

Further, he's 18th in par-4 400-450, 22nd in on Tour in GIR, T59 in birdie to bogey ratio. Mackenzie Hughes - $6,800 (Field, 9-4)    What, you didn't think we were going to pick a Canadian? The Ontario native is enjoying a fantastic rookie season, continuing to pile up FedEx Cup points well after his surprise win at the RSM Classic in November.
Mackenzie Hughes  ->  positive

Result: T23  Adam Hadwin 1.25pt EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I think Adam Hadwin is progressing nicely at the moment and he's added to my RBC Heritage team. On a course where most of the battle is tee-to-green, the Canadian sits 23rd in Strokes Gained Approach, 7th in Strokes Gained Around the Green and 22nd in Strokes Gained Tee to Green.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

While the behavior may not inspire confidence, a quick peek at his record this season suggests that a bounce back may be in order this week. So far this year, over seven events, Peterson has yet to miss two cuts in a row and has always followed up his missed cuts by making the weekend in his next start. And while there are no guarantees that trend continues, the extra public humiliation Peterson put on himself, and the fact he finished T11 at TPC San Antonio back in 2015, suggests it might.
Peterson  ->  positive

Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous. Like Johnson, he's of a standard slightly higher than those around him in the betting, and I don't see that there are any real doubts over the current state of his game, or the suitability of the golf course. If you're looking for a genuine horse for this particular course outside of Woods, then Francesco Molinari is the one having produced form figures of 34-5-17-9-7.
Johnson,  ->  positive

We've now witnessed three three-man playoffs in three of the last six years at Riviera and prior to the last two results, the previous four winners had all been at least a couple of strokes back with a round to go so it's a great place to trade on a Sunday. In 2015, Sergio Garcia was matched at a low of [1.4], Dustin Johnson hit [1.38], and Paul Casey dipped to [1.85]. All three were beaten!
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

History tells us he’s likely going to be a steady player for fantasy this week. Brendan Steele has started 2017 in fine form and should keep that up this week. He’s played this event each of the past six years and recorded three finishes of 6th or better in that span.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the SBS Tournament of Champions - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Hideki Matsuyama 4pts Win 5/1 with £10 free no deposit required via this link:  It's fair to say that when Hideki Matsuyama is putting confidently he's extremely hard to beat. The Predictor Model Number 1 has undoubtedly been playing the best golf in the world over the autumn and I can see no reason why he won't go extremely close again this week at a Kapalua course where approach proximity is so vital.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Kiradech Aphibarnrat 2 points @ 4-1 (Lads)  Russell Henley 2 points @ 4-1 (BetVictor and others)  Daniel Berger 2 points @ 7-2 (General)  Ryan Moore 2 points @ 4-1 (Lads)  Ian Poulter 2 points @ 5-2 (Lads)  **all top-20**  Apart from the excellent previews here on @thegolffamily, you’ll read tens of articles on the one event that towers over any in terms of historical trends – and I’m not about to argue with any of them. ADVERTISEMENT  Any perusal of the stats and profiles of winners comes up with the same conclusion and it’s a matter of interpreting them one way or another, but even looking at them in the most obtuse fashion, the same players come up again and again. Splitting the top ten or so in terms of winning, or at least contending, is too tough for me and whilst my own preference is for Bubba Watson to prove just too inventive for the rest, it is impossible to deny the claims of those around him in the market.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

William  ->  positive

Worth some loose change, surely. Back to reality and Marc Leishman ( 45/1 ) and Branden Grace (45/1 ) have to come into consideration. In fact, while I wouldn't ordinarily put both up along with two strong fancies, with such value in the place terms I'm prepared to go in this time.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

I don't think we need to pay up this high in cash games but he is my top GPP play of the week. James Hahn  World Golf Ranking (#63)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,100)  FanDuel ($9,100)  Hahn has been extremely consistent this season making all 10 cuts in stroke play events with a season-best runner-up at the Sony Open and three total Top 10 finishes. This week he stands out for a couple other reasons as well including the fact he is 30th in odds but 59th in DraftKings pricing and he is averaging more DraftKings points per tournament over his last five events(73.1) than all but one player(Keith Mitchell) in the sub $8K range.
Vegas  ->  positive

Palmer, who co-led at PGA National after 36 holes last time out, loves to play in his home state: top 5s and top 10s abound for Ryan across TPC San Antonio, TPC Four Seasons and his home course of Colonial. Statistically Palmer sits 9th in Going for the Green and 48th in Proximity from 150 to 175 yards, which are 2 key statistics for the GC of Houston. 7th here in 2014, wind and a soft course are the kind of conditions where Ryan truly comes to the fore.
Ryan  ->  positive

To me that should make him a 66-1 shot at best this week and on that basis I am delighted to be able to take a three figure price with seven e/w places available. RORY SABBATINI – 150-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 23rd  For my next pick I am going to back to the well with a player I have been following fairly closely of late in the form of Rory Sabbatini. Rory as we know has been in pretty solid form this year and was beginning to look like a winner in waiting when he finished 5th at the Valspar a few weeks back.
RORY SABBATINI  ->  positive

Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state. Piller has been wildly inconsistent on the PGA Tour, despite being a six-time winner on the Web.com Tour, one of which came last year to help secure his PGA Tour card this season.
Piller  ->  positive

T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?
Charles Howell III  ->  negative

He ranks 5th in Greens in Regulation, 12th in Strokes Gained: Putting and 16th in Total Birdies so far this season, all of which will help his cause here. Brian Stuard 80/1 (Betfred 5 places 1/4 odds and StanJames 6 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  “Strike while the iron is hot” so they say, and this iron is boiling right now. Stuard was one of the last off my list last week, as I sided with Chris Kirk at the same odds, which didn’t pay off in the end.
Stuard  ->  positive

Wins at the Japan Open, WGC HSBC Champions (-23/265), Taiheiyo Masters (-23/265) and the Hero World Challenge (-18/270) have been impressive. Taking his last 4 outings, including the CIMB Classic where he finished 2nd behind Justin Thomas with a score of -20/268, Hideki has made 4 Eagles and 100 Birdies, converting a Birdie or Better across 35.4% of the 288 holes he's played. 3rd at Kapalua on course debut 2 years ago when he co-led with Jimmy Walker after 54 holes, the Japanese No.1 made 23 Birdies and a field best 3 Bogeys before a disappointing single birdie over the final 9 holes saw him miss out on a play-off with playing partner Jimmy Walker and eventual winner Patrick Reed by a single shot.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

On just price alone, he looks good value at 40/1 but the course also plays to his strengths, so I really did not want to leave him out this week, with a return to form likely immanent. Abraham Ancer 125/1 (Betfair/Paddypower and Boyleports 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Despite being raised in Mexico, Abraham Ancer was born in Texas and currently resides in San Antonio, and he will look to carry his trending form over as he plays at “home” for the second straight event. In his last three starts, Ancer has finished T16 (Valspar), T13 (Corales) and T8 (Houston) and should he keep this form up he may well contend for his second win as a professional and first on the PGA Tour.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

It’s somewhat concerning that Rose has used a hot putter to propel himself to those lofty finishes in the past two events (at least 6.7+ SG: PUTT in each), but he’s one of the premier long-iron players in the field, tops in Birdies or Better Gained over the past 50 rounds and third in Par 5s Gained in that same stretch. Luke List  In classic Luke List form, he broke his putter in his Day 1 matchup against Justin Thomas at the Match Play and actually fared better on the greens with a wedge in his hand. Can’t make this stuff up.
Luke List  ->  positive

In ten starts at this event, Hoffman has never missed the cut. While Hoffman’s recent form tends to be only mildly predictive of future success, he certainly looked quite sharp at the API, so I’d keep him on your radar as a relatively safe option this week. Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Following a T-3 at Kapalua, he should be ready to finish a few notches higher against the year's first full field. Jonathan Coachman: Spieth ($11,500)  I was pleasantly surprised that Jordan Spieth decided to play this week. And after last Friday's round when he said his game "was close," he went out and proved it.
Spieth  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm? Cantlay’s LT Adj Rd Score (68.5) is tied for fifth, while his LT GIR percentage (69.7) is tied for 16th and LT Adj Bird Avg (15.4) ranks seventh.
Cantlay  ->  positive

(6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  We were on Brian Stuard last week at El Camaleon where he finished a single shot away from the extended each way places and I'm going to be patient with the Fort Worth, Texas-based 34 year-old who's playing phenomenal golf right now. A streaky scorer who clearly thrives on Bermudagrass and Paspalum putting surfaces, Stuard is also a strong coastal player. He can also string together results on his favourite putting surfaces.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.
Bozzelli.  ->  positive

Play him with confidence this week. Adam Hadwin ($8,800) – Hadwin has been blazing hot this year, and were it not for a few duds at Augusta, he would’ve had a pretty impressive rookie showing at The Masters. Harbour Town should set up quite nicely for his particular skill set, and the price is pretty reasonable for all formats.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Boasts five top-4 finishes in 2017, including a T-4 at the Irish Open. Justin Rose. The Englishman has a major under his belt (2013 U.S. Open) and came extremely close to another this year, bowing in a playoff at the Masters to Sergio Garcia.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

Casey has certainly performed well at other longer par 71 and 72 venues, such as Riviera and the Houston Golf Club, and there’s little reason to think Quail’s tougher layout won’t be a good fit for him. From a fantasy perspective, Casey also ranks as one of the better values this week as his $7,800 salary is the lowest it’s been since the Masters; this is despite his streak of constantly returning value, week in week out on DraftKings. Sometimes persistence pays off, and Casey is certainly someone who I could see breaking through at an event in which five of the last seven champions have been first-time major winners.
Casey  ->  positive

KEVIN KISNER – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED TIED 7th  The event saw it’s first South Carolinian native winner last year in the form of Wes Bryan and I was pleasantly surprised to see Kevin Kisner chalked up at 40-1 to bring back to back successes for the home state. Kis came close to winning at Harbour Town when he was a PGA maiden back in 2015 only to lose out in a play-off to Jim Furyk. Since then of course Kevin has notched up two PGA tour wins including one at a similar coastal track at the RSM classic.
Kevin  ->  positive

A T12 finish in Mexico last time out, following a closing round of 66 was a welcome return to form for Kizzire and he will look to put his strengths to good use this week. Kizzire ranks 11th in Par 5 Scoring Average and T19 in SG: Putting this season, and ranked similarly in Mexico. He ranked 11th on the Par-5’s and 25th in Putting, so should his putting pick up slightly, he can look for another big finish this week.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Augusta Trends  Sergio won the US Masters at the 19th time of asking and at the age of 37 and us stats fans were grateful to see a return to the norm. The two winners before Garcia, Spieth and Willett, had only played Augusta once before they won and that really went against the grain given previous course form is usually vital. Other than the first two winners of the event, Fuzzy Zoeller (in 1979) is still the only debutant to win the US Masters and most winners have been around Augusta National enough times to get to know its unique nuisances.
Spieth  ->  positive

He will likely be chalky but is a good play in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Justin Thomas  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (11/1)  Draftkings ($11,300)  FanDuel ($12,100)    Thomas capped off a five-win 2017 season with a 10 million dollar payday as the FedEx Cup Champion. While he isn't quite on the same pace early in 2018, he has been pretty darn good winning the CJ Cup back in October and has finished Top 25 in all six events.
Vegas  ->  positive

In a field therefore largely made up of long in the tooth journeyman or unproven maidens I am happy to chance the improving Kraft at what I see as a very generous 50-1. ALEX CEJKA – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 NON RUNNER - WITHDREW BEFORE START  In a second division event played on Papsalum greens Cejka always has to come in to the conversation. A proven winner on the European Tour Cejka decided to relocate and take up life on the PGA Tour in the early 2000s and after many years of toil he was finally rewarded with a victory at the Puerto Rico Open in 2015.
ALEX CEJKA  ->  positive

Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No. 1 golfer in the Colin Davy Player Model.
Johnson  ->  positive

His recent form is some of the best in the field: 12th, 25th, 5th, and 13th place finishes in his last four starts. Steals  Johnson Wagner ($7,700)  With harder pricing this week, I don’t think many people will target this range of golfers. If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

At $7,800, Dufner is a great cash game option but also has some GPP upside. -- Jeff Bergerson  Cameron Smith  Smith's breakout should continue this week, with the young Aussie having not missed a cut on the PGA Tour since last year's Dell Championship. Since then, he has picked up three top-20s.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

It’s also a Pete Dye course design so fire up the typical plodders and target practice golfers >> Donald, Duke, Furyk, Casey, etc…(sadly, no Kuch or Haas this week). Key Stats:  SG: Approach  SG: Off the Tee  Par 4 Scoring  GIR+  Birdie or Better %/Bogey Avoidance  Key Draftkings Targets:  Jordan Spieth 11.4k  Paul Casey 9.7k  Marc Leishman 9.3k  Tony Finau 8.7k  Kyle Stanley 8.6k  Charley Hoffman 7.3k  Webb Simpson 6.9k  Outright Bets:  Patrick Reed 28/1  Brendan Steele 33/1  Bubba Watson 35/1  Bud Cauley 45/1  Kyle Stanley 45/1  Jaime Lovemark 80/1  Kevin Tway 80/1  U.S. OPEN RECAP  Well, it wasn’t the 6/6 I was hoping for but those were few and far between and as you can see my 4/6 still managed to cash for $1,000 in the $333 Club Pro. Normally, I play my single bullet/top LU but I was feeling pretty good so stepped it up.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Phil looks set up for a big week in Mexico and possibly his first win in nearly five years. MY SLEEPER : Peter Uihlein ($7,100)  This pick is a touch out of left field, as Uihlein will make his debut at this event and is coming off a bad missed cut from last week. The good news, however, is that two weeks ago, the American was T26 at Riviera — a course with similar types of greens/rough to this week’s venue — where he gained 4.3 strokes around the greens and 3.3 with his putter.
Uihlein  ->  positive

His poor start to 2017 has been curious. Firstly, Schwartzel finished 2016 with third spot at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai and then took fourth in December's Alfred Dunhill Championship. He looked primed to start the new year fast.
Schwartzel  ->  positive

That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine. With a best of tied 4th at the Texas Open this season, it’s been a disappointing campaign but there have been signs in the last couple of weeks that Horschel may finally be springing into life. He followed up a tied-5th showing at the Wyndham Championship with another top 20 at The Barclays on the fiendishly difficult Bethpage Black.
Horschel  ->  positive

Lahiri ranks ninth in Birdie or Better percentage for the season, is T31 in par 5 scoring, and is coming in off of some solid recent starts on similar styled PGA venues. A T2 at another Nicklaus design (Memorial) and a T17 at an easier venue like TPC River Highlands is a good sign Lahiri could be in for another big week in Canada. Scott Stallings ($7,500): Stallings has been playing out of his mind the past two weeks and given that Glen Abbey lines up nicely—in terms of ease of setup—with the venues at his past two starts we probably shouldn’t look past the three-time Tour winner in DFS.
Lahiri  ->  positive

His current form (Win-6th last two starts), world ranking (19th) and previous U.S. Open experience to draw on makes him an intriguing option at 60/1. Shane Lowry 80/1 (BetStars) 70/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Shane Lowry has started to become a consistent feature in big events, taking his form in Europe over to America. He won the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC in 2015 and also finished runner-up at last year’s U.S. Open, so I am hoping he can go one better this time around.
Shane Lowry  ->  positive

It came courtesy of a closing 69 so he would have left Augusta National feeling pleased but with a feeling that there was still more to come, especially as he doubled the 17th in round four which denied him a top 10. Koepka tends to bunch good performances together and last year followed second place at the Byron Nelson Championship (his last strokeplay start in Texas) with another runners-up finish at the St. Jude Classic. His strong record in the majors (not outside the top 21 in the last seven he's played) shows he likes a tougher test and he'll certainly get that here at a tournament where the winning score has averaged just above 10-under over the last six years.
Koepka  ->  positive

His wife just had a baby, so he should be happy to be back out of the house playing golf. Add Wood to the list of English players I’ve mentioned: Rose, Fitzpatrick, Willett, and Westwood. Fabrizio Zanotti ($6,900) – The Paraguay should be comfortable in a World Golf Championship environment, having competed in last summer’s Olympic Tournament in Rio.
Rose,  ->  positive

With that being said, let’s get on to the sleeper picks of the week. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Scott Piercy ($9,700)  My main concern with Piercy is going to be the fact that he’s traveling from China, but hopefully he has a day off in between. He’s your prototypical desert golfer: born and raised in Las Vegas, and went to school at San Diego State.
Scott Piercy  ->  positive

KEY STATS FOR DFS PGA THIS WEEK:  Strokes Gained T-G Strokes Gained Putting Birdie or Better Drive Distance Fairways Hit GIR  DraftKings PGA Picks of the Week  Jon Rahm ($9800)  Jon Rahm is coming off yet another stellar performance as he finished T15 at the Safeway Open, carding an ace to go with it. We won’t be expecting another ace for Rahm, but we can expect another Top 20 finish. He’s proven to be one of the best golfers on Tour since he turned pro in the middle of last season, missing just one cut in nine events to go with six Top 25 finishes.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

The first standout this week comes in the form of Lucas Glover who’s odds are roughly 100:1 to win despite the fact that Glover will cost you only $6,600 towards the salary cap to get him in your lineups. Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play. The other standout is probably one that you’ve heard mentioned elsewhere in Charley Hoffman.
Glover  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign: First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2) Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33) Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18) Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25) Jim Furyk (T11-3) Robert Streb (WIN-T25) Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9) Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  Each week I think aloud to provide you with my One-and-Done selection as well as a few alternatives. Fade or Follow?
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week. With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week. Ian Poulter – Cash – DK: $8700 FD: $7400  Poulter continued his streak of good play at the Open Championship with a T14 finish.
Finau  ->  positive

Looking at the salary gap on DraftKings between the two, I will take the discount with Rahm as new courses have not even come close to stopping this kids momentum early in his career. Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#34)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,300)    Believe it or not, Molinari actually comes in a tick higher than DJ in the form ranks this week. I look at each player's last five events and average their finish positions.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

The tiny greens are Bermuda grass and are guarded by hazards so look out for good GIR stats, good scramblers and good Bermuda putters with an emphasis on strokes gained tee to green. Brandt Snedeker 25/1  Snedeker played well in Kapalua last week finishing in a respectable T14 on 12 under par for the week. He has been playing well over the last few weeks with a win at the Fiji International at the start of October and then went on to finish T6 in The Bahamas at The Hero World Challenge.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.

We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  negative

Pebble Beach has been one of the better spots for the Australian in recent years, missing just two cuts in his last eight. In that span, Jones has managed to accumulate three top-15 finishes, including an 11th and 7th in the last two renewals. Jones has made four starts in the 2016/17 and played just the once since the turn of the new year.
Jones  ->  positive

2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form. Bay Hill is a course he thrives on and capturing another big U.S tournament victory - his first since 2015 - must be a target he feels is within reach this week.
Rose  ->  positive

A T2 at the Dean & Deluca a week before a T13 finish at the Memorial Tournament suggests he is finding his better stuff at the right time. The reason Spieth is not dominating as he has in the past is his play with the putter this season. Before, Spieth was just streets above on the greens, but so far this season he ranks just 40th in Strokes Gained: Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Result: MC  Zach Johnson 1pt EW 125/1 with *For the latest bet365 Opening Account Offer details see below. Major Championships aren't won on spreadsheets but Zach Johnson's PGA Tour stats are eye-catching to say the least. The 2007 Masters Champion sits 12th in Scoring Average, 4th in Bogey Avoidance, 25th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 15th in par-4 Scoring Average and 13th in par-5 Scoring Average.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Surely, he's entitled to be closer to the front of the market and he's a strong each-way fancy. Like the aforementioned Every, Johnson thrives in events such as the Texas Open, the Sony, Colonial and the RBC Heritage, and Kevin Chappell rates an interesting contender having won the former last season. It was a long overdue success for the former Nicklaus Award winner who was considered one of the brightest sparks in US golf when he emerged on the scene, and his rewards for it included a Presidents Cup debut late last year - an experience he'll be keen to repeat in Paris come September.
Johnson  ->  positive

Picks to win  Ryan Moore  I was tempted to pick Tiger Woods here, but -- spoiler alert -- I'll save that one for next week. Instead, the pick is Moore, who arrives at the intersection of form and familiarity. He owns top-10 results in two of his past four starts and finished 18th and third in the past two editions of this tournament.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Kevin Na has also made all four cuts of his Greenbrier career: T36 in 2010, T7 in 2012, T52 in 2014, and T32 in 2015. Tony Finau finished T13 in 2015, his only try at The Old White TPC. Ted Potter, Jr. won in 2012 and followed that up with a T6 in 2013 and T26 in 2014.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Last season, List’s two best finishes of the season came at the CareerBuilder Challenge (T6), where two of the three courses are Pete Dye designs and the Honda Classic (T10) which is also well known for its windy conditions. If List is going to get off the mark on the PGA Tour anytime soon, he is going to want to ride these patches of form he is going through, and he can go again after that T3 finish two weeks ago. A T39 finish here last year was his first full week at Harbour Town, after withdrawing in 2013, where his 36-hole score of +5 would have missed the cut anyway.
List’s  ->  positive

Like Grace, he played well without ever contending. Perez opened with a pair of 74s and, again like Grace, was one of just a dozen players to come up with two sub-par rounds on the weekend. In truth, his strong play at the Masters was a continuation of the good form he's show over the last four or five months.
Perez  ->  positive

What that will mean for a mid-length hitter off the tee is that he can swap the driver out off the tee to find better success, and then smoke his irons off good lies to find the green. Casey would be my pick to win, so offers excellent value at only $8100 on DraftKings. He’s had great success at Majors – 34 of 53 cuts made, and nine top-10s – and has looked great this season with a solo 6th at Augusta and a 26th just recently at Erin Hills.
Casey  ->  positive

Should be awesome. Berhow: Dustin Johnson wins at five under, Justin Rose is the runner-up for the second straight major and Mr. Lee Westwood is third. Zak: I've convinced myself that Jason Day will continue his recent solid form and that Erin Hills will play very similar to Whistling Straits (at least for him).
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Tommy Fleetwood – 2 points outright @ 25.0 (lay back 3 points at 5.0)  Bubba Watson – 1 point outright @ 46.0 (lay back 4 points @ 7.0)  Emilliano Grillo – 2 points top 10 @ 5.5  Lucas Glover – 5 points to beat Ryan Moore @ 2.00  Jason Kokrak – 3 points to beat Louis Oosthuizen @ 2.20  Click here for Matchbook’s latest golf markets. Again I’d have Kokrak a marginal favourite based on recent form and think this one has been priced on name recognition. He ranks in the top 34 of both of our key stats and finished last week ranking 8th in strokes gained tee-to-green and 10th in strokes gained around the green so his all round game is clearly in good nick.
Kokrak  ->  positive

2nd here on debut as a rookie in 2014 and the winner here in 2015, East Lake has always been one of those courses which certain players simply 'get'. Spieth is certainly in that camp and despite all of the top 6 in the FedEx Cup standings having legitimate chances in Georgia this week, I think the World Number 2 has all of the tools he needs at his disposal to capture the FEC title for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. When asked in Chicago what he likes about East Lake, Spieth replied: "East Lake and Augusta remind me a lot of each other.
Spieth  ->  positive

And we all know he should have won (or at least made the playoff) at the PGA Championship there if not for a bogus ruling in a bunker on the final hole. Steals  Francesco Molinari ($7,800)  This is a crazy low price for Molinari, who has been on a tear recently. He ranks 1st in my statistical model, mostly thanks to his incredible ball-striking the past few months.
Molinari  ->  positive

Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler. I think all of these names are viable picks this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

On and on it goes. Jon Rahm, winner of this year’s CareerBuilder boasts numerous combined good finishes in Pheonix and at Houston, whilst last year’s winner round here Adam Hadwin has two top-3 finishes at La Quinta (and a T6), third Dominic Bozzelli finished top-5 at the CareerBuilder, and the two previous winners have form at Houston. Geddit?
Dominic Bozzelli  ->  positive

Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season. After a slow start at Firestone last week, Fowler fired rounds of 67/66 to climb inside the top-10 (9th), continuing his good form and hopefully taking momentum to Charlotte this week.
Fowler  ->  positive

It has two par 5’s, four par 3’s and 12 par 4’s. Previous winners include Heath Slocum (2010), Ben Crane (2011), Tommy Gainey (2012), Chris Kirk (2013), Robert Streb (2014) and Kevin Kisner (2015). The main thing that stands out here is that length is not important, however SGP, greens in regulation and par 4 scoring stats are certainly worth mentioning.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Whilst of course defending champion Dustin Johnson has shown what it takes to get it done round here as well, I just feel that after last week JT is the one with the momentum at the moment and I’m happy to give him the nod. JORDAN SPIETH – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – ¼ odds 1st 5 FINISHED 14th  The next player I like from a price point of view out of the market leaders is Jordan Spieth. Spieth’s troubles which have been mainly on the greens this season have been well documented.
Spieth.  ->  positive

20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total.
Mickelson  ->  positive

He was well behind Spieth's runaway total, but he did finish second in the field in proximity and third in strokes gained putting. And, like Harman, Kisner was in contention throughout at Erin Hills. Cameron Smith - $7,600 (30-1)    Here's a case of the odds not being in sync with the DraftKings price – the oddsmakers like Smith more, and that catches our eye.
Kisner  ->  positive

Adam Scott  ->  positive

Rafa is ultra-consistent, fast becoming a factor in the biggest events, and should really love this test, if his great form in the Dubai Desert Classic is the guide it usually is to this major. Henley needs to build on strong first round showing  Back Russell Henley for a Top 10 Finish 2u @ [10.5]  Another of my 100 Winner picks, Henley has yet to make a top-ten here but is making steady progress towards it. He's improved with each of his four Augusta starts and finished 11th last year.
Henley  ->  positive

He'd sat tied for 22nd and five back after round one. Willett sat tied ninth and four adrift after day one two years ago but 12 months earlier, Spieth and Rose sat first and second after the opening round and that's how they finished the tournament, with Spieth winning wire-to-wire. Bubba took a very typical route to the title in 2014 when he sat in a tie for second, just one off the lead, after opening the event with a three-under par 69 and he was three clear at halfway after a second round 68.
Spieth  ->  positive

Danny Lee  3. Jonas Blixt  MY PICK : Paul Casey ($8,800)  Casey, remarkably, has only one win on US soil thus far in what has otherwise been a very impressive career. While he’s let some opportunities slide by recently, his game is still in top form.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

He is riding a streak of three finishes of T26 or better and has missed just one cut so far this season. Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town.
Molinari  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

Last year’s winner Dustin Johnson led the year long stats in that range in 2016 and 2015 runner-up Bubba Watson was also very strong in that area when he won. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($10,600): Fowler has played remarkably well ever since February and is probably a tad unlucky he only has one win to his credit thus far. That could easily change at Firestone however, a course where Rickie has finished inside the top ten on four out of seven visits.
Rickie  ->  positive

Walker hasn’t lost strokes to the field on approach shots since last year’s TOUR Championship, and is sixth best in the field on P4s 450-500 yards over his past 24 rounds. Oh, FYI, Walker was recently diagnosed with Lyme Disease. Based on his latest results, it doesn’t seem to be affecting him all that much.
Walker  ->  positive

Last week however in Houston he ranked 18th in SGP and the flat stick particularly clicked for him in his Sunday round of 65. When Henley won the Honda Classic he shot 78 66 in his previous event to miss the cut, however the sign was there from the 66 on the Friday that something had fallen in to place. It would appear therefore that he is the sort of player who takes a momentum on to the next week and if he can do that here, when returning to a venue he has improved at every year, he could well surprise at a big price.
Henley  ->  positive

He has recorded a top 15 at the Honda in five of the last seven years. Longshots:  Wesley Bryan (150-1 to win, 12-1 top 10, 7-1 top 20)  Wesley Bryan enters this week on the back of two missed cuts, so his odds have dropped significantly. Bryan held the 36-hole lead last year en route to a fourth place finish.
Wesley  ->  positive

That added to T10 (Texas Open) and T9 (Heritage) in his two previous starts so, without question, the man from Daytona Beach, Florida is playing some excellent golf. Looking at Cauley's scorecards, in Houston he was T10 for Birdies, 6th in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee and 14th in SG: Putting. At Hilton Head, he was T3 for Birdies and 8th for Strokes Gained: Tee to Green.
Cauley's  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson  Five of the Swede’s 11 top 10s in the majors have come in the PGA and that ties in with the idea that he usually plays his best golf in the second half of the season. Stenson has finished 7-25-3-3 in the last four editions of this event and, after a decent defense of the Claret Jug (T11 Open), added T17 at Firestone on Sunday after shooting 70-69 on the weekend. But now the big fly in the ointment.

Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches. All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year.
Morgan Hoffmann  ->  positive

Course history truthers will ignore Chez this week as he’s missed a handful of cuts at this course, but he did finish T9 at Sedgefield back in 2011. Reavie has shown he can compete in scoring fests this season, going a combined -58 in four easy tests during the fall swing season (from the Shriners to CareerBuilder), and fits the same mould as Kevin Kisner to a smaller degree:  5 th in Driving Accuracy (71.66%)  in Driving Accuracy (71.66%) Excellent in Approaches above 150 (36 th , 79 th , 19 th )  , 79 , 19 ) 26 th in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 th in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%)  in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%) 8 th in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 th in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%)  in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%) 1st in Proximity to the Hole  The one area Reavie has struggled has been with the flatstick in hand, losing 0.940 strokes in 99 events played on Bermuda, but he’s actually had a much better season in that regard; Reavie is 64th in SG: Putting overall and a spectacular 16th in 3-Putt avoidance, but he does struggle outside 10 feet. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Brian Gay ($7300): On an easy track that basically amounts to a proximity and putting contest, there are few better putters worth a punt than Brian Gay – Gay has gained 1.785 strokes putting on Bermuda (1.663 elsewhere).
Chez  ->  positive

Zach Johnson: Prior to last year’s 54th-place finish, ZJ had six straight finishes of 26th or better, including a runner-up finish in 2012. Johnson’s 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks third among golfers with more than one start at TPC Sawgrass. Zach’s 61.3 LT SC percentage ranks 21st, his 13.9 LT Adj Bird Avg is 30th, and his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score is tied for 36th.
Johnson:  ->  positive

Key Stats:  Ball Striking  Strokes Gained Tee to Green  Par 4 Scoring  Strokes Gained: Approach  Strokes Gained: Putting  Greenbrier Classic Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Bill Haas (DK: $10,800, FD: $8,800)    Weak field events are Haas’s jam, and we get another one this week. Haas enters the Greenbrier in good form, as he’s made four straight cuts with no finish worse than 25th. His approaches, putting and Par-4 scoring have all been good over that time frame, and all are stats which we will want to target this week.
Haas  ->  positive

As for iron play, Fowler sits a very healthy 7th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green while he's 12th in Approaches from over 200 yards. Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio. That's the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC, a long par 70 with testing par 4s, and Fowler has cracked the top 10 in his last three appearances there.
Fowler  ->  positive

Since winning the Masters in April, Garcia has been able to back that win up with some strong play, including a T2 finish in his last start at the BMW International. Although he broke his major goose-egg at Augusta, it is the Open which has always been Garcia’s favorite major, as he has an incredible 10 finishes of T10 or better at this event since 2001. While younger players like Rahm and Spieth certainly come in with confidence, the Open has been an experienced player’s paradise recently with the last six winners all being 39 years of age or older.
Garcia  ->  positive

DJ also ranked 26th in SG:App last season which helped him rank third overall in tee-to-green strokes. Johnson is coming in hot after finishing runner-up at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship last week and sixth in the Tournament of Champions three weeks ago. He was 13th at the Farmers last season and finished third in 2011.

Indeed, given that he didn’t play a World Golf Championship in 2013 or 2014, three starts prior coming when he was not yet ready, he’s effectively hit the frame in three attempts from seven. Such numbers only take us so far and it’s quite clear that Willett has endured an up-and-down 10 months since taking advantage of an opportunity handed to him by Jordan Spieth at Augusta. Right now, he’s still bedding in some swing changes and in some part they help explain his poor display as 54-hole leader in Malaysia two starts ago, where he barely scraped a place after a closing 73 having led by three shots with a round to go.
Willett  ->  positive

Tiger, Phil, DJ, Bubba, Sergio, Spieth and the complete list of the world’s Top 50 players.

Spieth  ->  positive

7th at El Camaleon, 8th at Waialae, 2nd at Torrey Pines and play-off loser 2 weeks ago at TPC Potomac, Charles is certainly trending in the right direction and his record on resort scoring tests and here at Deere Run is decent enough. 2nd in Actual Scoring Average, 1st in Bogey Avoidance, and 29th in Proximity to Hole are season-long statistics upon which you can build a real challenge for the John Deere Classic and Howell, who's ranked in the top 50 for Strokes Gained Tee to Green for the past 4 seasons, has also added some cutting edge with the putter of late. 44th in Putting Average, 49th in Strokes Gained Putting and 15th in my 10-week Putting Average tracker is worth taking note of, especially as he ranks 1st in my Greens in Regulation tracker as well.
Charles  ->  positive

Woods of course has eight wins here (including 2008 U.S Open) and Phil Mickelson has three wins in the event itself. It has been an up and down start for Snedeker so far in the 2016/17 season. He has finished T6 at the Hero World Challenge and T12 at the Tournament of Champions but missed the cut at the Sony Open, so a mixed bag thus far.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth 7/1  I don’t know what it is about Augusta but it seems to really suit Jordan Spieth. Despite missing the cut last week in Houston, Spieth has been in great form with a win and five top 25’s in his last seven starts. He started 2017 off with a T3 at the SBS Tournament of Champions and followed that with a T9 in Phoenix, a win in Pebble Beach, T22 at The Genesis Open and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

I don't think we need to go stars and scrubs this week in cash games but Rickie makes a very high upside GPP play and is the only player on my sheet to rank Top 10 in all four categories. Billy Horschel  World Golf Ranking (#81)  Vegas Odds (110/1)  Draftkings ($7,100)  FanDuel ($8,400)  If you are looking to take a risk and go a bit contrarian this week consider Billy Horschel. He comes back to PGA National with back to back Top 10 finishes in 2017 and 2016 but could be lower owned as the form has been pretty bad lately as he is coming off back to back missed cuts.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

: Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 ) and greens (20 ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor.

LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th. At best however if you catch Lucas on the right week, in tough conditions, with ball striking at a premium and a few putts drop, he is still a class act and can get right in the hunt and, as a three time winner on tour including a US Open, he does know how to win a golf tournament!
LUCAS GLOVER  ->  positive

Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price. Selection:  Marc Leishman @ [22.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with my Portugal Masters preview.
Leishman  ->  positive

Looking at the same rolling report for Strokes Gained: Around the Green, Dufner ranks 19th, 34th, 15th, and 9th over his last 4, 8, 12, and 24 rounds here. Also using Fantasy National Golf Club, we notice that Dufner is an excellent wind player and with this week's forecast, that will be key. Top Current Form Targets  Byeong Hun An  World Golf Ranking (#86)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($9,400)    In the form section, I will be highlighting multiple players who bounced back in a big way after back to back missed cuts earlier in the season.
Dufner  ->  positive

Donald’s most recent win came in Japan back in 2013, and whilst he has not won in America since 2012, Fitzpatrick can certainly draw inspiration from his career so far. Fitzpatrick tweeted Monday evening saying “Now onto my favourite week of the year @RBC_Heritage”. Whether it be the fact he finished so well here as an amateur three years ago or just the fact they invited him during his time as amateur, who knows, but it can only be a positive that he speaks so highly of the event.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

the RSM Classic winner, Austin Cook, is an interesting debutant at a big price and Kevin Streelman, who currently ranks third for Scrambling and second for GIR, was third here in 2013. Selections:  Cameron Smith @ [34.0]  William McGirt @ [90.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [120.0]  Austin Cook @ an average of [148.0]  Kevin Streelman @ an average of [160.0]    I'll be later with my Open de Espana preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Austin Cook,  ->  positive

We’re down to 15 so now we can get serious! The Contenders  Here are the remaining 15 players, in order of how I priced their winning chances:  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Louis Oosthuizen  Brandt Snedeker  Shane Lowry  Ian Poulter  Zach Johnson  JB Holmes  Hideto Tanihara  From these I’ve derived my following tips:  Tip #1 - Winner  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Tip #2 - Top5  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Tip #3 - Top10  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Tip #4 - Top20  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Tip #5 - Top South African  Louis Oosthuizen  Tip #6 - Top USA  Rickie Fowler  Brandt Snedeker  Summary  Sergio Garcia should win; Rickie Fowler the closest challenger;  Rose & Matsuyama can be expected to go well without quite making it;  Stenson & Scott should safely place Top10;  Casey & Leishman can be relied upon as Top20 bets;  Snedeker, for me, ranks a value-reeking 2nd in the Top USA market, behind Fowler;  Oosthuizen should easily be Top South African;  Best longshot - take your pick(s) among: Lowry,Poulter, Zach JB & Tanihara. Cheers & Good Luck with your golf punting  Mike (@SmartGolfBets)  Monday 17 July
Rose  ->  positive

Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 374.5  Last Week Rank: 3822  Chesson Hadley ($28,000)  Jimmy Walker ($23,500)  Keith Mitchell ($14,900)  Abraham Ancer ($14,600)  Kevin Tway ($12,900)  Cameron Champ ($5,400)    Analysis: A great mixture of current form, course history, and potential here. Champ makes his second appearance of the week. He is a long shot, but we are certainly willing to take a shot at this low price.
Champ  ->  positive

Kuchar is an excellent discount play over Stenson this week. Bill Haas ($9,200) – Another guy on tour who is pretty much the definition of “ho hum”, Haas is (generally) consistent, patient, and effective tee-to-green. Some courses are just going to be too big for him, but a place like Copperhead is where he can thrive, evidenced by his playoff runner-up finish last year.
Haas  ->  positive

Putting is clearly of lesser importance here, as the greens are flat and allow even shaky putters to look graceful with the flat stick -- think Hideki Matsuyama, Kevin Stadler, and two-time runner-up Bubba Watson. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12500 – Spieth’s unparalleled putting gets the headlines, but last year he was second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, a major ingredient to success at TPC Scottsdale. Spieth is obviously great at all aspects of the game and can win anywhere, but his combination of smarts and talent should net him his third top-10 finish in as many starts in Scottsdale this week.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Hudson Swafford  Vegas Odds - 80/1  Draftkings - $7,800  FantasyAces - $4,950    Like Steele, Hudson Swafford has played here both years that Silverado CC has hosted the tournament(formerly known as FRYS.com Open). He is the only golfer(Steele was close) in the field to finish both inside the Top 20 with a 17th last year and 8th the year before. He also hits in the stats department with rankings of 31st in SG: OTT, 56th in SG: APP, 29th in overall Proximity, 34th & 28th in Par 4/5 scoring and 19th in BoB%.
Steele,  ->  positive

Update: With a weather draw potentially favoring golfers that play Spyglass on Saturday, I'm going to make a late change. My new pick will be Patrick Cantlay who ranks 30th in weighted course history but ranks 9th over long-term skill. He ranks #2 behind Jon Rahm (already used) when isolating golfers that will play Splyglass on Saturday.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

On his promotion to the PGA Tour this autumn, Spaun acclimatised slowly to the higher level, but his best result by far came at El Camaleon where he finished 28th and he showed his liking for Paspalum greens by topping the Putts per GIR category that week. Harold Varner III 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  There's a massive difference of opinion over Harold Varner III this week with Paddy Power and Betfair pricing him as short as 35/1. The very early 80/1 in the market has rightfully been snapped up, but with the price history of this event 66/1 with HV3 is not a bad place to be this week.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

(Not that he'd show up, but still quite the question.) For now, we are left with a still-pretty-dang-intriguing tournament at Kapalua, with seven of the top eight in the OWGR on hand, including the top-five: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Hideki Matsuyama. Not too shabby.
Justin Thomas,  ->  positive

The average ranking was 10.6, so a top-15 ranking in Greens in Regulation and Scrambling looks to be part of the recipe this week. Market Leaders  Dustin Johnson (11/2)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Jordan Spieth (14/1)  Justin Thomas (18/1)  Phil Mickelson (28/1)  Selections  Chez Reavie 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Chez Reavie finished T2 for the second week in a row last week at Pebble Beach and has finished inside the top-24 in 9 of his last 10 events (T36 finish at the CareerBuilder the anomaly). His last missed cut came at the RBC Heritage last April, which is quite an extraordinary run from the 36-year old.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course. It's no wonder he has a stellar track record in major championships.
Spieth  ->  positive

Have a good feeling about a guy who is long off the tee and can make birdies in bunches. DraftKings bargain: Stewart Cink ($7,000). T-17 or better in two of three CIMB starts, and barely missed out on making it to East Lake last season.
Stewart Cink  ->  negative

Casey had similar finishes (T11 and T13) so, again, there's no way the Aussie should be two-and-a-half times the price. Going into the BMW, Leishman is a very healthy seventh in the FedEx Cup standings after he took another big leap with third place at TPC Boston last time. Leishman got himself in a great position to win the tournament before a poor tee-shot at 10 set him off on the wrong path coming home but it's hard to be too down about a top three.
Leishman  ->  positive

Fowler’s record here is almost as good as Matsuyama’s, as he has two runner-up finishes in eight starts at this event and was T4 last year as well. Outside of Rickie, other possible low-owned plays include Byeong-Hun An ($8,000; led here by three shots last year with nine holes to play), Russell Henley ($7,600), Zach Johnson ($7,700), Peter Uihlein ($6,800) and Emiliano Grillo ($7,200), who was sixth in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green last week. Top Strokes Gained: Tee to Green from Last Week  1.
Peter Uihlein  ->  positive

Initial thoughts are 'probably not' but he does have a second (Scottish Open) and a 10th (Irish Open) on windy links and also recent knowledge that he can take on the best after finishing runner-up in the US PGA. Tommy Fleetwood - 25/1  The market may just be underestimating Fleetwood here. He's the new European No.1 and topped the greens in regulation stats when enjoying that new status with a tied sixth place in last week's Hong Kong Open.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

When he’s not gaining off-the-tee, he’s making those shots up with really good scrambling ability. Bottom line, Streelman makes cuts and doesn’t make bogeys. He has decent upside as well, sprinkling in three Top 10 finishes across his 13 made cuts this year.
Streelman  ->  positive

Finally another point that caught my eye is that Kirk has a top 5 finish at the Nicklaus designed Muirfield village host of the Memorial, an event which has been won by Dufner and Lingmerth over recent years, who finished 1st & 2nd in this event respectively in 2016. RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open.
RUSSELL KNOX  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month. Stenson is tied for fifth with his 68.4 LT Adj Rd Score and ranks fourth with his 15.8 LT Adj Bird Avg.
Stenson  ->  positive

I would personally instead prefer to start in the $10K range and target players like Jason Day (five top-tens in six US Opens), Rickie Fowler ($10,500) and Jon Rahm ($10,300). Going down further some other solid cash game targets include Paul Casey ($8,400), Louis Oosthuizen ($7,400), Francesco Molinari ($7,000), Peter Uihlein ($6,900) and Marc Leishman ($6,700). Tournaments: Even with the two missing the cut at the Memorial, I would still expect Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm to soak up a lot of ownership this week.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

68-68 was good enough for 13th after 36 holes, but Schauffele ultimately needs a more open course where he can use his undoubted strengths. 16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. RESULT: T73  Chesson Hadley 2pts EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*.
Billy Horschel,  ->  positive

The Tiers  $12,000 - $10,000  CASH: He was our GPP play last week but this week for cash I am going straight to the top with Jordan Spieth. Spieth comes into Pebble with great form having posted a 9th last week after getting off to a rocky start was able to find his groove and surge on the weekend with two prior 3rd places in the fall.. Jordan's game is well suited for this event and he is sneaky long enough to hit the big par 5's in two. After getting his irons and wedges dialed in on the weekend at the Waste Management, I'm confident he will be throwing darts on this rain soften course.
Jordan Spieth.  ->  positive

I won't miss Perez later in the year, so Pat Perez will be my pick. They didn't pop in the history + baseline method but golfers like Austin Cook, Cameron Smith, and Marc Leishman all pop in the recent form and course fit department. I think all three of them make for solid OAD picks, as well.
Cameron Smith,  ->  positive

I’m expecting further improvement this year as he will have learned a lot from that and he closed with a 69 giving him the all-important round in the 60s. Steele also finished inside the top 20 in the WGC Mexico which is always a good pointer to where the long-game is at for a tilt at the Masters. That long game assurance is backed up by a very impressive stats profile as he ranks 7th in GIR, 19th in bogey avoidance, 10th in par 4 scoring, 7th in strokes gained: off the tee and 35th in strokes gained: approaches.
Steele  ->  positive

Kirk hasn’t missed a cut at this event in his last six starts, and his 68.6 Course Adj Rd Score ranks fourth among golfers with more than one start at this track. Kirk had struggled this season, but he finished 12th in his last time out at THE PLAYERS Championship. Humpnostication  Hump’s prognostication machine has been pretty brutal, so take this with a grain of salt (or whatever else would make you approach its potential validity with caution).
Kirk  ->  positive

Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks. He is third in the field in SG:APP, seventh in SG:ATG, sixth in Par 4 Scoring, fourth in Bogey Avoidance, ninth in Scrambling and first in Birdie or Better %.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

His game has also been pretty hot in the last few months. While not as potent as Simpson here, Johnson has top 15s the last three years in Phoenix. He’s subtly been one of the most high-producing consistent golfers in the world of late, with finishes between T-8 and T-23 in his last six starts.
Johnson  ->  positive

Luke List  MY PICK : Hideki Matsuyama ($10,200)  Hideki’s form has turned around of late as he’s now finished inside the top-15 in each of his last three starts, and he looks to be close to the level of play which vaulted him up the world rankings in late 2016. Matsuyama ranks second in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee this season and is also second on tour in Par 4 Scoring, two stats which line him up for a nice week at Firestone. While Hideki has never finished better than 12th in four starts at this event, he has won in Ohio before at Muirfield Village, a venue that definitely shares a few traits with this week’s course.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Naturally on his last outing in late November, Jon won his biggest title to date when securing the DP World Tour Championship. The European Tour finale since 2012 had always been won by a player with a previous top-7 finish, but Rahm showed his true world class by winning on course debut - taking the opportunity when Justin Rose collapsed on the back 9. Rahm is so good and so talented that he bucks trends, simple as that.
Rahm  ->  positive

Taylor was seven adrift after the opening round last year and Mickelson managed to win in 2012 having been nine off the lead after day one! It's perfectly possible to win from off the pace with a round to go too and in addition to Taylor last year, who trailed by six, we've also seen Tiger Woods win from five strokes adrift, Phil Mickelson six, and in 2001, Davis Love III won from seven back. If you're betting in-running on Sunday, be very wary of the par five 14th hole, as it's far from a certain birdie hole.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Our statistics expert has picked these three players for you selection. Pick of the favourites: Henrik Stenson  View player profile  The reigning Race to Dubai champion has started 2017 as he finished 2016 with two top tens including a runner-up finish in Dubai in his last appearance. Going further back, the Swede has finished inside the top ten in eight of his last 11 starts worldwide and has four top tens in his last six WGC strokeplay events.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Last year's winner, Jon Rahm, was runner-up in the Canadian Open in 2016, Jhonattan Vegas, who's won the last two editions of the Canadian Open, finished third here on debut in 2011, Farmers winners, Jason Day and Bubba Watson finished one and two in Canada in 2015, and recent Glen Abbey winners, Brandt Snedeker and Tiger Woods are multiple Torrey Pines winners. I recognise that one could argue that Woods, Day, Watson, Snedeker and Rahm are just high quality players that can win anywhere but in addition to those five and Vegas of course, it's also worth highlighting that the 2009 winner of the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey, Nathan Green, who was a huge outsider, also finished runner-up at Torrey Pines in 2006 at a massive price. Is There an Identikit Winner  Stallings was something of an anomaly and although a multiple PGA Tour winner, Ben Crane couldn't be described as top-class but every other winner going right back to the last century has been straight out of the top drawer.
Jhonattan Vegas,  ->  positive

THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row. Charley loves Texas, but I really think that blow-up at Augusta will be on his mind for some time – at 40-years-old, he really isn’t going to get many more chances to win a major.
Matt Kuchar  ->  negative

Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event. This time around, he’s up to a career-best 11th in the OWGR and has finished top-six five times in his last six starts.
Johnson  ->  positive

A past winner here, Henley is a threat. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Russell Knox - $9,000 Rafa Cabrera Bello - $8,000 Russell Henley - $7,900 Thomas Pieters - $7,700 Keegan Bradley - $7,600 Ollie Schniederjans - $7,600  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

Russell Knox  ->  positive

Rory for the win. Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (18/1)  Draftkings ($9,300)  FanDuel ($9,200)  Whether you are fading the top three players or looking to pair one of them with a high-end value, Rickie Fowler makes perfect sense. He is in the low $9K range on both sites and compared to his Vegas odds is a +3 value this week.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

The way he bounced back from his day-two showing with a 69-71 over the weekend showed the consistency and resiliency you need to consider him in every other kind of contest as well. Mid-Priced  Harris English ($8,700) – He has never missed a cut here, and he’s been inside the top-15 three separate times. That’s a solid enough course history to make him a great cash game consideration, and one you should feel even more comfortable with coming off his T14 last weekend.
Harris English  ->  positive

Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout. Kevin Na: Easily the most underappreciated talent on the PGA Tour, Kevin Na lost four strokes to the field putting across the week (including five in his first round en route to a three-under 68) but compensated for that with an absolutely ridiculous 7.1 strokes gained on approach and 5.52 (!)
Rahm:  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should. It’s not a bad price, but the likely ownership, less than stellar form and lack of success at Riviera leads us to fade him completely.
Finau  ->  negative

The upwardly mobile World Number 23 arrives in Honolulu with impressive form which reads 3(ToC)-3(QBE ShootOut)-4(RSM Classic)-8(HSBC Champions)-5(CJ Cup) - all that is missing is his 3rd PGA Tour victory. That could easily come at Waialae, where Harman has shot 15 of his last 16 rounds under par, including a 64, 65 and a pair of 66s. Brian featured in the final group here in 2015 - 3 shots back from eventual winner Jimmy Walker - and commented after a Saturday -6/64 "There's a lot of local knowledge that goes into this place, so just knowing the course a little bit better is key.
Brian  ->  positive

Add to this that he ranks T14 in Par 5 Scoring Average and he certainly has the right profile to win here. Harman does rely fairly heavily on his putting at times, but he does everything he needs to do well enough to win here and that’s why I think he is clearly overpriced at 40/1. In six starts at Bay Hill, Harman has literally been 50/50, missing three cuts, countered by three top-17’s.
Harman  ->  positive

5th for Greens in Regulation and 4th for Strokes Gained Approach last week in Los Angeles, I think a motivated Justin will take all the stopping this week. RESULT: Winner  Brandt Snedeker 1.5pts EW 55/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds): - read our Betfair golf betting review here . Brandt Snedeker fits the bill pretty perfectly.
Justin  ->  positive

Fowler's ability to produce in great fields and aggressive putting style should fare well at Glen Oaks this week. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Jon Rahm, $8900 – The powerful youngster made his name known this season with a win at Torrey Pines, another long layout with poa annua greens. Rahm ranks fifth in Strokes Gained: Total on the PGA Tour and can easily find himself in contention should he keep his emotions in check.
Rahm,  ->  positive

Andrew Landry ($8,100 | 160) - Spending down on too many options probably isn't necessary this week when we need only six golfers, so don't go too heavy on the punt plays. But you can consider Landry, who finished fourth at the RSM in his most recent action. Prior to that, he withdrew at the OHL and missed the cut at the Shriners.
Andrew Landry  ->  positive

I also like Bud Cauley ($8,500) here for a bounce back at an easier venue. Other potential tournament targets for me here include David Hearn ($8,100), Johnson Wagner ($7,500), Roberto Castro ($6,500) and Chris Stroud ($6,800). Top Recent Form  1.
Roberto Castro  ->  positive

Thomas finished third here last year and should be able to take easy advantage of the scoring holes with his T2G potential on easier courses. MID TIER  Tony Finau ($8,600) – He may have given us quite the scare at the Memorial before his insane hero charge to make the cut on the last three holes, but I expect that Finau will have a much easier time doing some serious damage on a course that should play dramatically easier than Muirfield. Like the other two noted, expect him to overpower this course with a great shot at being in the weekend mix.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

£100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Kevin Streelman is always a dangerous player on any low scoring course where outright power is not the be-all and end-all. On a great run of form across his past 4 events which reads 18(Colonial)-13(Muirfield)-8(TPC River Highlands)-17(TPC Potomac), Streelman has a host of top results across resort-level scoring assignments. 3rd at Kapalua in 2015 (-17/275), 1st at TPC River Highlands in 2014 (-15/265), a couple of 8th place finishes at the John Deere Classic (2009/2012), 2nd at TPC Summerlin in 2014 (-18/266) and 4th at El Camaleon this season (-17/267) jump off the page.
Streelman  ->  positive

A look at the course would be beneficial though, given the tough nature of the course and event. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title. Finau ranks highly in multiple areas this season, including top-25 in SG: Approach, Par-3 Scoring Average and Par-5 Scoring Average, all key areas this week.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

This time around though, he had no horrific rounds, he was just steady all week long (69-71-70-70). Again 12 months ago, Harman put together a familiar week finishing T13, two shots shy of Hudson Swafford and Tommy Fleetwood in 10th. If Harman, who has played the best golf of his career over the last two years can just shave a shot a round off his usual scoring here, there’s every chance he contends and there is no reason to doubt that he can do that here.
Harman  ->  positive

Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.

All of them played at Kapalua last week, all are outsiders, and with the possible exception of James Hahn, all have form at correlating venues or Waialae.

James Hahn,  ->  positive

Johnson led the field in Strokes Gained: Putting last week at Firestone, which always bodes well heading into major week and if the rest of the game clicks this week, he could well get his third major victory and be just one step away (U.S. Open) from the Grand Slam. Looking purely at his stats throughout the season, Johnson has been having a terrible year, ranking 72nd in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green, 86th in Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee and 119th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green. His short game stats (25th SG: Around-The-Green and 44th SG: Putting) are his only real saving grace statistically, but should his upturn in form continue, these stats should improve greatly.
Johnson  ->  positive

. Course Adj Rd Score (count of at least two): 67.7, Paul Casey ($9,500)  Casey has been on an absolute tear recently. His back-to-back second-place finishes and triple-digit DraftKings scores are sure to make him a popular pick going forward.
Casey  ->  positive

10th in Strokes Gained Putting, 4th in Putting Average and 3rd in my 10-week Putting Average tracker all help immeasurably. Harman has always been the sort who performs well on shorter set-ups. Even this season he finished 3rd at PGA West with a -18/270 total.
Harman  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  One year ago, Spieth missed the cut at the first two playoff events, only to win the Tour Championship and still claim the FedEx Cup. He learned a lesson from that: It's not how you start the playoffs; it's how you finish 'em.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Summary of Bets  The Masters  Jordan Spieth – 3pts ew @ 10/1 (1/5 odds 8 places Betfair SB) and 3pts win @ 12.0 on Betfair Exchange  Jason Day – 1.5pts ew @ 16/1 (1/5 odds 10 places Skybet)  Matt Kuchar – 1pt ew @ 35/1 (SkyBet) and 2pts Top 10 @ 5.0 on Betfair  Brendan Steele – 0.5pt ew @ 125/1 (Skybet) and 3pts Top 20 @ 11/2  Zach Johnson – 0.5pt ew @ 100/1 (Skybet)  Hideki Matsuyama – 3pts Top 10 @ 10/3  Weekly pts advised = 24pts The stand-out 10/3 looks very tempting indeed for a player who hasn’t finished outside the top 11 the last three years. While I’m not sure he will ever win this I am sure he will rack up the top 10s with his towering, accurate approach play ideal for holding these fast greens.
Jason Day  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay  Ben Coley provides a group-by-group guide to the WGC-Match Play Championship, with three each-way bets recommended. Group 1 Dustin Johnson  Kevin Kisner  Adam Hadwin  Bernd Wiesberger The draw for the defending champion could hardly have been kinder. Of the players in Pool B, few have been struggling as badly as Kevin Kisner of late - the fact that these struggles have taken place on courses so well suited to his game is particularly disconcerting.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

: Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 ) and greens (20 ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor.
Henley  ->  positive

In 2015, eventual champion Justin Thomas flirted with a 59 before going on to win the event at an astonishing -26. LAST FIVE WINNERS  2016 – Justin Thomas -23 (over Hideki Matsuyama -20)  2015 — Justin Thomas -26 (over Adam Scott -25)  2014 — Ryan Moore -17 (over Gary Woodland -16)  2013 — Ryan Moore -14 (playoff over Gary Woodland)  2012 — Nick Watney -22 (over Robert Garrigus -21)  WINNING TRENDS  Three of the last five winners were playing in this event for the first time  Both the first- and second-place finishers in this event over the past three years have ranked inside the top-50 in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Each of the past four winners had already played in at least one fall-swing season event  STATISTICS  Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Birdie or Better Average  Par 4 Scoring  This event is very much about going low and a winning score in the -20s won’t be shocking. The past four winners here have all ranked either first or second in the week for Birdie or Better Percentage, making this a stat to target.
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

Course & Field Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Yet another #SeaIslandMafia underboss, Matt Kuchar leads the high-priced tier and is tied for third in the field with a 14.8 LT Adj Bird Avg. Kuchar’s 68.5 LT Adj Rd Score is the best in the field, and he’s tied for second with Brandt Snedeker with 5.3 percent Odds to Win. Kuchar has played in five of six tournaments here and has never finished worst than 25th.
Kuchar  ->  positive

He knows the course from his Georgia Tech days like the back of his hand. Fade: Patrick Reed. He’s finished 19th and 27th the past two seasons, and didn’t break par a year ago.
Patrick Reed.  ->  negative

Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn't exactly fit the "bomber" prototype that tends to succeed here, but he didn't play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition's averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance with his driver -- he sits near the top in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes. Moore is a very steady player on the par-4s, but he'll need to improve on the par-5s to really have a chance to finish near the top this week.
Moore  ->  positive

Returning to the power angle, I think it may be worth forgiving JB Holmes a couple of missed cuts since he played in the final group at Torrey Pines. Firstly, the disappointment of missing out on the play-off there will have stung and if we go back to his last win, it's interesting to note that Holmes had come up just short three weeks before, then went on to miss the cut at Bay Hill before a hard-fought victory in Houston. Secondly, he was forced to go on the defensive - and rightly so - having taken over four minutes to play his second shot at the final hole of that event, and it's possible that the media spotlight which he felt was undeserved had a detrimental impact on his performance in Phoenix just days later.
Holmes  ->  positive

Rec Adj Birdies: 17.3, Patrick Reed ($9,000)  DJ leads all players in this metric, but Reed in next in line among players in this range of salaries. Reed started the playoffs in fashion, with a victory at The Barclays and a fifth-place finish at the Deutsche Bank Championship. He finished 13th at the BMW Championship two weeks ago despite hitting only 56 percent of his greens and 42 percent of his fairways in regulation.
Reed  ->  positive

Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory.
Casey  ->  positive

The $10 Million prize. Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now.
Spieth  ->  positive

In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats. Paul Casey ($9,000): I have been using Casey in every tournament this year so why stop now.
Molinari  ->  positive

Yet the former amateur star has made the cut in every start, highlighted by two top-three finishes. With a relatively weak field, this could be Cantlay's platform to shine. The gamble in this group is Hadwin, who took the tour by storm in the early parts of 2017 with a win, four top-10s and a 59, yet has been a non-entity as of late (missing three of his past five cuts).
Cantlay's  ->  positive

Steele placed sixth at the Tournament of Champions two weeks ago has solid history at the CareerBuilder, finishing 34th in 2016 and runner-up in 2015. With the way the pricing works this week, you can fit Steele and Johnson in the same lineup and still build a nice team. That should be a great approach as this is a good "studs and duds" week.
Johnson  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

Even after a few early wobbles, he showed unbelievable grit, class and mental toughness to get the job done in Royal Birkdale after a couple of early bogeys. After finishing solo fourth in New Orleans which included a 64 in the final round, Spieth went on to finish T2 at the Dean and Deluca Invitational after an impressive final round 65. He then travelled to Ohio for the Memorial tournament and finished a respectable T13 for the week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week. This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day.
Spieth  ->  positive

Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
Matt Kuchar  ->  negative

Ranked 3rd in P5S & BoB%, and has really good course history with 5/6 trips here no worse than a 13th place finish. $3 GPP Ownership Guess: 15-20%  Jordan Spieth - DK Salary $11,600 - It's so close for Spieth right now, and I'm overly confident he will win one of the remaining three events this season. His strokes gained approach numbers looked much better last week, and that part of his game had been holding him back.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late. And let's not forget one Tiger Woods who's been a revelation on his return to the PGA Tour.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
Tommy Fleetwood.  ->  positive

Grillo is typically a bottom-100 player on the greens, but this season he is near the top. That's a sign of either improved play -- after all, Grillo is only 25 years old -- or early-season variance, but his price tag makes it worth the risk to find out. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Kiradech Aphibarnrat  Newer daily fantasy PGA players might not be terribly familiar with the "Barn Rat," but he has been very good of late, picking up a win at the Super Six last month and an impressive fifth-place finish at the WGC Mexico two weeks ago.
Grillo  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes. His play so far this year is good enough to land him within the top-60 in every major statistical category.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s missed one cut here in five tries since his win in ’08, and has had a pretty stellar year to date with three top-10s (two T4, one T8) and having made five straight cuts. Reavie is consistently deadly accurate off the tee, an above average putter, and he crushes the world with a short iron in his hands (4 from 125-150, 30 from 100-125). He’s more known as a par-4 scorer, but Reavie is also demolishing par-3s this year (2.98 scoring average, 6 ) and with four tough par-3s that will be crucial.
Reavie  ->  positive

There was certainly no disgrace in losing that last-16 clash and Oosthuizen's game appeared to be in good shape, especially considering how often he does manage to find another gear in the events that matter most. Indeed, I strongly suspect that the 2010 Open champion is only really engaged when he turns up in majors these days and that's backed up by his now famous grand slam of runner-up finishes, including second to Thomas at last year's PGA Championship. Here at Augusta, he lost a 2012 play-off to Bubba Watson and after struggling to put that behind him a year later, has since built up a solid bank of form with three top-25 finishes in four and no further missed cuts.
Thomas  ->  positive

His big hitting off the tee will always give him a chance, but he is hitting a good percentage of greens (73.93%) this season and that will go a long way this week. Kyle Stanley 125/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  Kyle Stanley is a player that has been off the radar for a while now, but this week I think he has a chance to put himself firmly back in the spotlight. Five years on from his win here, Stanley has not yet managed to find another win.
Stanley  ->  positive

Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign. A win at the CIMB and a 5th at the CJ Cup in his last two starts suggests Perez is ready for another strong season and after four events currently sits in 2nd place in the FedEx Cup standings.
Perez  ->  positive

Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark. Surely, he's entitled to be closer to the front of the market and he's a strong each-way fancy.
Johnson  ->  positive

He is probably too risky for cash games but is an excellent, high upside GPP play. Who the Stat Like  Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#74)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,100)  I already talked about Hadwin and Steel who rank #1 and #3 in my overall model so we will jump right to the guy in the middle of them, Tony Finau. Looking at the field ranks for this week, Finau is 1st in SG: OTT, 2nd in SG: OTT + APP, 5th in Driving Distance, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd and 14th in GIR from 175-200 and 200+ and 15th in both Bogey Avoidance and Birdie or Better %.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Johnson finished 15th here last season, which isn’t good when there’s only 18 golfers, but he has ripped off three wins and an additional six top-10 finishes in 12 tournaments since the start of June. Jordan Spieth ($10,300): Spieth won the Australian Open two weeks ago and has the second-best Odds to Win (14.3 percent) this week. Spieth dunked it on the Par-3 second hole here last year, earning the all-important DraftKings hole-in-one bonus on his way to a fourth-place finish.
Spieth  ->  positive

Watney feels like more of a GPP play, but if you’re playing in large cash game contests, we wouldn’t mind the move. Best bargain basement option:  Trey Mullinax $6,900 – Mullinax doesn’t necessarily fit the profile for Sedgefield from a stats perspective since he’s a bomb and gouge type guy. However, Trey is a sneaky good putter and proved that all year last year on the Web.com tour.
Trey Mullinax  ->  positive

He’s a great value this week. Wesley Bryan ($7,500) – Bryan’s exceptional performances recently at both Riviera and PGA National warrant some reasonable attention this week as he will be on a course where his particular skill set should very much come in handy regardless of his lack of length. If his tee-to-green game is on point, Bryan is dangerous around and on the greens, and he could be an excellent value pick this week.
Wesley Bryan  ->  positive

He almost escaped his group, but was bested by eventual winner Bubba Watson. Then, Suri hit the road the next day and played his way into the Houston Open, where he finished T8. Already twice a winner across the pond (on both the Euro and Challenger Tours), Suri is a highly volatile player, but one with gigantic upside.
Suri  ->  positive

9 in the OWGR, being in a happier place. Tier 2 Values    Justin Rose - $8,400 (20-1)    Rose has the tools to play well at Riviera, where he tied for 16th last year and posted two other top-15s through the years. Rose stumbled on Sunday at Pebble to tumble down the leaderboard, but he had a pair of top-4s in his two prior outings.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience. He has had significant success at British Opens in the past, and I believe his superb T2G game and should put him squarely in the conversation to ship this event, particularly if the conditions get nasty.
Fowler  ->  positive

Further, Wagner is fresh off a T5 finish at another Par 70 TPC course last week, where he posted 78.0 DraftKings points. Wagner has posted 64.25 PPT and a +20.18 Plus/Minus in his last two trips to the Old White. Outside of DFS, he currently has +8,000 moneyline odds in the prop market to win the tournament.
Wagner  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup. Bradley did win the WGC-Bridgestone event in 2012, but despite a bunch of top-5 and top-10 finishes since, he has failed to record another PGA Tour victory. Before that last win, he had the chance to kick off 2012 in style, but Bill Haas ruined that here, beating both Bradley and his 2012 Ryder Cup partner, Phil Mickelson.
Bradley  ->  positive

It has been an exciting opening six months to the PGA Tour season with four first time winners securing invitations to The Masters.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

9. Emiliano Grillo, Argentina -- The 23-year-old probably wrapped up the 2016 Rookie of the Year Award on the PGA Tour last week when he tied for second behind Patrick Reed in his FedEx Cup playoffs debut at The Barclays. Grillo, who won the season-opening Frys.com Open in a playoff over Kevin Na in October, has added nine finishes in the top 25 this season and ranks sixth in the point standings heading into the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

This will be his fourth start at his national Open, so he has some experience to draw on. Statistically, Kisner has been solid this season, which has allowed him to accumulate five top-10’s including his win. He ranks 37th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee which is vital this week, but more impressive is how he ranks in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green (9th), Stroked Gained: Tee-to-Green (9th) and Stroked Gained: Putting (23rd).
Kisner  ->  positive

One week after last year's Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III contended for three days at the Greenbrier, don't be surprised to see the current Presidents Cup captain get into the mix on a course where he's won before. -- Jason Sobel  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner has "only" won the John Deere Classic once, but since 2010 his average finish is between seventh and eighth place. The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois.
Johnson  ->  positive

I'm going to keep my pick along those lines, taking another former major champion and Ryder Cup player whose game had suffered a bit of a tailspin but is now enjoying a bit of an uptick. Bradley owns top-10 finishes in each of his past two starts and should have plenty of confidence at a tournament where he finished T-8 last year. Michael Collins -- Jason Bohn ($7,600)  In the three years the tournament has been held at this venue, Bohn had finishes of T-2, T-7 and T-3.
Bradley  ->  positive

Quicken Loans National Picks (Yahoo Game)  Brendan Steele & Bill Haas – After churning out another T15 at the Travelers, Steele has now reeled off 21 consecutive cuts made dating back to July of 2016 and has the ideal consistency for a player taking on an unknown course. One of the premiere Par 4 scorers in the field, Steele also sits 14th on the season in scrambling… Haas doesn’t exactly hit every fairway anymore, but he’s continued to churn out quality results based around his consistency and top tier short game. Ranking, 15th in SG: ATG for the year, he’s reeled off three straight T25 finishes (including a T5 at the US Open) and has a knack for posting wins on shorter tracks with weak fields.
Haas  ->  positive

15th for Greens in Regulation last week at Bay Hill, Harris has always taken a liking to coastal challenges. The 2014 OHL Classic winner at El Camaleon on Paspalum greens, English has putted positively across his past 3 appearances. 2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014.
Harris  ->  positive

John Peterson 200/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  I put Peterson up for the other event in his home state, the Shell Houston Open, just for him to withdraw before the off, but I like chances that bit more here, at the same price. Last week, Peterson turned up to the RBC Heritage off the back of some travelling issues and a weekend in Vegas, but this time the father-to-be looks to be in better focus. In a reply to a tweet effectively asking him if there will be any pre-tournament distractions this week, he stated “Nah.
John Peterson  ->  positive

A fantastic long game has always been the Japanese sensation's biggest asset - 302 yards off the tee and Total Driving ranks of 21st in 2016 and 13th for the season-to-date doesn't tell a lie - however when Hideki is most dangerous is when the flat stick is cooperating too and he's in the middle of a purple patch in that respect right now which should spell danger to the rest of the field. 3rd for putting average at Erin Hills (1.63 putts per GIR), 15th at Portstewart (1.68) and 2nd at Birkdale (1.67) is the best prolonged spell we've seen from Matsuyama since he won an incredible 5 events in 9 global starts either side of Christmas. With confidence clearly growing once again with the putter it will only take a decent ball-striking week on a course which suits like Firestone for him to be knocking on the door once again.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He’s 12th on Tour in birdie or better percentage, 15th in rough proximity and ninth in proximity from 175-200 yards. Luke List - $14,200    List has rattled off five straight finishes of T26 or better as he currently resides in the top-70 of the OWGR for the first time in his career. Not only is he third on Tour in driving distance, but he’s also 23rd in birdie average and 17th in SG: T2G.
List  ->  positive

His only knock on the cheatsheet is the Strokes Gained: Approach but looking at his last five events, he has gained over two strokes to the field in the category and that is skewed big time by his U.S. Open performance where he lost almost two strokes to the field. Like I mentioned above, I don't think you need to go into this range for cash games but I think Reed is trending in the right direction and has the upside to win us a GPP this week. Who the Stats Like  Brendan Steele  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,800)    I could have easily fit Steele into the form tier as he has been one of, if not the most consistent golfer on the Tour.
Reed  ->  positive

He's tied with DeLaet for the second-best win odds in the tournament, as well. Wesley Bryan ($8,900) - Bryan opened at 18/1 along with DeLaet and McDowell but is up to 16/1 now, making him the odds-on favorite to win, so I'm not really going out on a limb here. Still, Bryan sits 73rd in the Official World Golf Rankings, making him the highest-ranked golfer in the field.
DeLaet  ->  positive

So in a world where there are question marks about the 2 single-digit market leaders, the relaxed theme of the Sony Open could well play into Marc's hands in his quest to post 4 strong rounds this week. 8th for Greens in Regulation, 2nd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green, 6th for Proximity to Hole and 8th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green show an approach game which is in rude health and Leishman is a proven Bermudagrass green winner who shot -23/261 to win the BMW Championship last August. Brian Harman 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
Leishman  ->  positive

Steve Rawlings takes a look at the local challengers at this week's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale...  “This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.“  Three of the first four in the Top GB & Ireland market are English - Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey - but it's now 25 years since an Englishman won the Open Championship so we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Rose, Casey, Fleetwood and their fellow compatriots, even if one of them, Fleetwood, is playing very close to home. Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years. Ian’s locked in right now and the last laugh will be his come Sunday evening when his name gets carved on the Claret Jug.
Poulter  ->  positive

Deserves to be included in top plays for the week as well. Paul Casey ($8,600): Casey is grouped with a bundle of very good quality players this week but he still sticks out to me as the best option. He started 2017 fairly slowly but I really like the fact he was in contention at the Farmers a few weeks ago, a course he’d never challenged at previously.
Casey  ->  positive

Fowler and DJ two back. Sens: Rose five under, Spieth four under, Rahm even. Passov: I've been picking Spieth since 2015, primarily because it was defensible: He's pretty good at this game, and he came close at the 2011 U.S.
Spieth  ->  positive

Like DJ, his record on Bentgrass greens is very good and he arrives at Eagle Point in fair form given he was beaten in a playoff in Phoenix in February and that he was tied 11th at the Heritage last time out. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [6.4]  Webb Simpson @ [44.0]  Carl Pettersson @ [260.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow morning with my Golf Sixes preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Carl Pettersson  ->  positive

He is also a TCU grad so he has a nice local narrative playing in his favor this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Bud Cauley  Cauley returns to competition this week and has been showing some really good form as of late. If you include the team effort at the Zurich Classic, he has finished in the top-10 in three straight events.
Cauley  ->  positive

Henley’s third tour victory came last year at the Houston Open when, with the final place in the Augusta field on the line, he shot 65 on Sunday to overturn a four stroke deficit to cruise to victory. Henley’s form this year has been a little patchy however he seemed to click at just the right time when he closed with a 65 yesterday in Houston to finish in 8th place. So we’ve established Henley is running in to form at the right time however what makes him really jump of the page this week is his progressive form figures at Augusta.
Henley’s  ->  positive

Form wise Casey is playing sold golf at the moment and could follow up his top 10 last week in Pebble with another good week here. Phil Mickelson 25/1  Phil seems to be warming up nicely lately with back to back to 5’s in his last two starts. He has been in good shape since the start of the season posting a T3 at the Safeway Open back in October and followed that with a T15 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China, which included a final round 67.
Phil  ->  positive

Top-level scrambling to avoid damaging bogeys is essential and only those with the hottest putters ultimately triumph. So I'm turning to Jon Rahm this week for a number of key reasons. Naturally on his last outing in late November, Jon won his biggest title to date when securing the DP World Tour Championship.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total. Roster the veteran in this weak field event.
Mickelson  ->  positive

There’s a plethora of players vying for a place in the six-man line-up for the official European Tour fantasy game and the addition of some top Americans, who are now eligible, adds to the difficulty for gamers. Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood will surely be a staple of most line-ups given their exploits here last year while Dutchman Joost Luiten could be a big-value outsider to cause a few waves. One To Swerve  Tyrrell Hatton’s T10 last year may have been based on the fact he was in fantastic form rather than loved the course.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Beau rewarded this exemption by finishing 39th. There is no doubt that Hossler has the pedigree to succeed on the PGA tour and he is certainly a player who will be fully focused on the job in hand this week. He is sure to have plenty of local support and again like Cauley he is a very strong putter, which will be rewarded here.
Hossler  ->  positive

As an indication of how little change there is, look at the state of affairs last year after rounds one and three... Round One  Andrew Landry -4  Dustin Johnson -3  Lee Westwood -3  Shane Lowry -2  Sergio Garcia -2  Scott Piercy -2    Round Three  Shane Lowry -7  Andrew Landry -3  Dustin Johnson -3  Lee Westwood -2  Daniel Summerhays -2  Branden Grace -1  Sergio Garcia level par  Scott Piercy level par    Since as far back as 1898, no winner has been further back at halfway than Simpson, who sat tied for 29th and still six off the lead. He's the only winner in the last 11 years to be outside the top-three places after 36 holes and he's the only winner to be outside the top-12 at halfway since Larry Nelson back in 1983.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Those two second places at East Lake add to a pair of runners-up finishes at nearby Augusta National so playing Rose 'without Spieth' makes extra sense given that he's been the nearly man so many times in Georgia. It's stating the obvious to say that Spieth would out-putt him if the two were locked together coming down the stretch so I'm convinced this is the best market for Rose this week. Of the other short-priced candidates, Jason Day has really found something in the last few weeks so would be my next cab off the rank in the sub-20/1 shots.
Rose  ->  positive

I want the Texan as my anchor. Jon Rahm ($11,000): Entered 2017 ranked 137th in the OWGR. He's now 4th in the world rankings.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Grillo did also get to -16 at one stage, which was one better than the two that contested the play-off, but a back-9 41 led to a final round 74, which ultimately cost him. In the end Grillo finished T11 last season, which was a stellar attempt on debut and now with a year of experience under his belt alongside some good current form, he looks a good bet to go better this time around. Kyle Stanley 100/1 (Betfred & StanJames 6 places ¼ odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Statistically, Kyle Stanley is a dream fit for me this week so to leave him out at 100/1 would make no sense.
Grillo  ->  positive

Charl Schwartzel at 66/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - gone well here before; can easily ignore last week  0.5pt e.w. Robby Shelton at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - top-class talent in the making  Considering that host venue TPC Four Seasons is not perhaps among the more popular layouts on the circuit, another strong field has been secured for the AT&T Byron Nelson. That's in part a reflection of the sponsors, in part the fact that so many touring professionals have a connection to Texas, and in part the the schedule, which kept many of the game's biggest and best away from the spotlight between the Masters and last week's PLAYERS Championship and now in need of exercise.
Robby Shelton  ->  positive

Among these golfers, those who have high Adj Rd Scores and low salaries make great value plays. Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm?
Cantlay  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Henrik Stenson 2pts EW 12/1  Justin Rose 1pt EW 25/1  Brandt Snedeker 1pt EW 40/1  Branden Grace 1pt EW 45/1  Russell Knox 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 11 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter @Doublebogey63  Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Knox has performed well on tough courses this season and if he putts well he could have a decent chance here. He looks to have the game that could suit this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, second in GIR, 35th in scrambling and 19th in par 4 scoring.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

If he brings his “Olympics” game to Bathpage he could be a big danger here. Brandt Snedeker 40/1  After shooting an impressive final round 67 to finish T3 at The Wyndham last week, that makes it his second top five in his last three starts for Snedeker. He has been showing some decent form lately finishing in a respectable T17 at The Dean and Deluca Invitational and followed that with a T21 at The Bridgestone, T22 at The Open Championship and a T5 at The RBC Canadian Open.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

However, we still have a relatively strong field this week. The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

So it's hard not to like Rickie this week on a coastal course where wind will undoubtedly be a large factor. 2 visits have generated a 6th (2013) and 5th (2016) and it's true that Fowler has never arrived on Maui with such total confidence in his putter. Whilst Spieth, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have question marks against them in my mind with recent performances, Fowler seems at the peak of his powers and his record after winning is also an interesting angle.
Fowler  ->  positive

McIlroy is tied with Johnson atop the field with his 67.6 LT Adj Rd Score, and his massive, field-best 17.5 LT Adj Bird Avg makes him an elite play in DraftKings’ birdie-heavy scoring system every week. On FanDuel, McIlroy ranks behind only Johnson with 50.6 fantasy points per game in Rounds 3 and 4. We currently have McIlroy projected to be the chalk play of the week with 26-30 percent ownership in large-field tournaments.
Johnson  ->  positive

All three are great options, but it's not a bad week to choose anyone from the course history list, as history often repeats itself here at El Camaleón Golf Club. Personally, I want to back someone who is accurate off the tee this week, so I will pluck Russell Knox from the list above and use him as my One-and-Done pick this week. After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Selections    I've surprised myself and backed Adam Scott and I've taken a chance on four outsiders... I'm not convinced the venue's right for Smylie Kaufman but he's been catching the eye of late and he's one of few making his debut so I've had a small wager on him and I've also played Chris Kirk, D.A Points and John Huh. Kirk, who's a winner of the aforementioned RSM Classic, has played here only once before when he missed the cut in 2012 after a disastrous opening 78.
Chris Kirk,  ->  positive

Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts. Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix.
Taylor  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players this week as follows;  MARTIN PILLER – 200-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED MC  For my first and if you like my headline selection this week I am going to actually start with by far the biggest priced player in my team in the form of a Lone Star State guy Martin Piller. The reason to be Piller heads the list this week is basically his price. I really don’t get it and would say 100s is as big as he should be and certainly not 200s.
Martin Piller.  ->  positive

Boston though with its Bentgrass greens will be a blessed relief, especially as 5 of his 8 PGA Tour titles have been on pure Bentgrass putting surfaces. 10th last week on Long Island featured a very strong greens in regulation game (for the second tournament in a row), but Spieth's hallmark putting failed to fire with the poa annua. I'm not so sure that will be the case at the Deutsche.
Spieth's  ->  positive

That momentum didn’t quite carry over the 2017 calendar year and so far he has let a lot of people down on DraftKings. However, Casey fits this course perfectly, and has the Augusta narrative working in his favor. Casey came second here in 2015 and has back-to-back top 6 results at the Masters.
Casey  ->  positive

Of the two, I prefer McIlroy, who was a solid T20 on his first start here and has strong off-the-tee stats that fit the style of past winners. Other potential tournament targets include Alex Noren, Bubba Watson, Jason Kokrak, Sam Saunders and James Hahn. Top Strokes Gained: Tee to Green from Last Week  1.
Sam Saunders  ->  positive

Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar.
Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.
Castro  ->  positive

Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green. Haas came T14 last year at the Heritage, so there is potential he can crack inside the top 15 again. He will be much lower owned then other $9K golfers, setting up the perfect GPP pivot.
Haas  ->  positive

With all this mind, it is time to look at this event both from a betting and fantasy prospect. Betting selections  Jimmy Walker 50/1 (General)  Walker played terribly last week, no doubt about it, but the 2016 PGA Championship winner can make amends here. In seven efforts here, Walker has two top-10’s and a 12th, all of which came in his last four attempts.
Walker  ->  positive

The all-important wind is forecast to be in the single digits the first two days before strengthening on the weekend, to nearly 20 mph on Sunday. Key Stats to Winning at Sea Island    • Greens in regulation  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling  • Par 4 Birdie or better percentage (P4BOB)  • Putting average (putts per GIR)    Past Champions    2015 - Kevin Kisner  2014 - Robert Streb  2013 - Chris Kirk  2012 - Tommy Gainey  2011 - Ben Crane  2010 - Heath Slocum    Champion's Profile    Driving distance is not important. Accuracy off the tee isn't especially important.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Glover looks to be good value here for a guy that’s bang in form. Cody Gribble 50/1  The Texan has been playing some fantastic golf so far this season with three top 15’s in his last four starts. He had a good week at The Safeway finishing T8 and didn’t shoot worse than a 70 throughout the week.
Cody Gribble  ->  positive

RESULT: T35  James Hahn 1pt EW 80/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I like the look of James Hahn this week who's been playing some great stuff on the West Coast and who has course form to boot. A player who can blow ice-cold, finding season-long statistics to back up any thoughts on him is nigh on impossible, but despite 3 relative poor outings in the autumn Hahn still ranks 49th for Birdie or Better Conversion, 29th for Strokes Gained Approach and 46th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green. What's really caught my eye though is Hahn's recent putting form which sees him sitting 9th in my rolling 10-week Putting Average tracker.
Hahn  ->  positive

And has some nice kind of rolling hills and some rolling greens that kind of dip off on the sides." Perez, by the way, has a couple of top sevens at Innisbrook. Bryan, a three-time winner on the Web.com last year (the first two coming in late March and April), is a short hitter (167th Driving Distance), who does his best work on and around the greens (35th Scrambling, 7th Putts Per Round) so this place should be a good fit.
Perez,  ->  positive

RESULT: T29  Chris Kirk 1pt EW 60/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Chris Kirk is another who fits the bill very well this week. A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Put those two things together, and he ended up in fifth place. Branden Steele  Need some more tee-to-green to fill out your card? Then give Steele the nod.
Steele  ->  positive

Among these golfers, those who have high Adj Rd Scores and low salaries make great value plays. Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm?
Cantlay  ->  positive

I prefer Haas over Webb this week due to a few stats. He is better off the tee, a slightly better scrambler and looking at that GIR from 150-175 stat, Haas is ranked 5th while Webb is ranked 87th. With both golfers projected to be in the Top 5 of ownership, I won't have a whole lot of exposure this week as a GPP player.
Haas  ->  positive

Players with comparable salaries and LT metrics have previously produced an average of 76.89 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +0.76 Plus/Minus and 54.3 percent Consistency Rating. Spieth has three top-25 finishes (including a fourth-place finish) and a missed cut in his past four trips to Riviera. Rory McIlroy ($11,100) missed the cut at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am after looking like his old dominant self in two European Tour starts in January.
Spieth  ->  positive

I have absolutely no doubt at all that he will at least make the cut this year, and he’s got a pretty good shot of being quite relevant on the weekend. VALUE  Tony Finau ($7,900) – We’re now on bentgrass which automatically means that Tony Finau becomes about twice as good of a play as he was earlier in the season – and he was already a decent play on those tracks. He’s played exceptionally well over the last two years at Muirfield, and now we get him at a ridiculous bargain price on a course that suits him pretty much perfectly.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Lee was a very respectable 52nd on tour in Stroke Gained tee-to-green in 2016 and has very high upside at only $6,700. I look for Danny Lee to be widely ignored across all GPP formats while having a better projected range of outcomes than anyone in his price range. Good luck to all this week and I hope this has provided a different perspective on the game theory at play behind daily fantasy golf.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Naturally this Ryder Cup sub-plot will now continue through both the Deutsche and the BMW Championship with 3 Captain's Selections up for grabs after Crooked Stick in 2 weeks time. Fowler, Watson and Kuchar will be hard to shift, but a successful FedEx Playoff campaign, the likes of which we saw from Billy Horschel in 2014, could well change things. From a FedEx Cup perspective, Patrick Reed now leads from Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

DraftKings bargain: Bill Haas ($7,000). His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.)
Haas  ->  positive

With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week. Click To Enlarge!
Summerhays  ->  positive

He started the season with a T7 at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia which included a second round 63 and a final round 65. Casey then tee’d it up at the CJ Cup finishing T19 and followed that with a T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions, T8 in Pebble and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship where he shot three rounds of 68 or better. Casey then went to Copperhead where he shot a final round 69 to post 10 under in total, one clear of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed.
Casey  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship.
Rory  ->  positive

After putting up 10/1 winner Hideki Matsuyama in Phoenix last week, Dave Tindall brings us his analysis and tips for this week's PGA Tour event - the AT & T Pebble Beach Pro-Am...  Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      While some of the big names have struggled to get going this season, Justin Rose has started 2017 with a bang. Rather than play the Middle East Swing, the Olympic champion opened his campaign at the Sony Open in Hawaii and carded 66-64-66-64 to finish second, albeit a distant one, to the red-hot Justin Thomas. Rose was delighted though.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Fowler is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee ranking 32nd in driving distance, 36th in GIR, first in SG putting and fifth in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a good history on this course, Fowler looks another big contender here. Daniel Berger 60/1  I am sticking to my guns and backing Berger for the second week running here.
Fowler  ->  positive

Check me out on Twitter (DFSBenj) for much more PGA, NFL, and NBA daily fantasy content. Key Stats:  Strokes Gained: Approach  Scrambling  Par 4 Scoring  Approach  AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Targets  Dustin Johnson $11,700  In my opinion, Johnson has easily the best wedge game in the world, and I will heavily target him anytime we get to a course that require short approach shots. DJ is a multi-time winner of this event and will play three rounds with his usual celeb partner and father in-law Wayne Gretzky.
Johnson  ->  positive

Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds. His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day.
Chappell  ->  positive

After missing the cut at The Masters a couple of weeks ago, we’re hoping Steele is lower owned than usual in GPPs. Steele is an elite ball striker on tour which will come in handy with windy conditions inevitable in Texas. He’s 1st in SG: OTT and 28th in SG: APP in the last 12 rounds.
Steele  ->  positive

8. Rickie Fowler: Fowler was a late addition to this week's field as he looks to make the Ryder Cup squad, with only one top-10 finish in his last eight PGA Tour starts. But a third-round 64 at the Olympics showed that the form he displayed en route to early-season success isn't lying very far beneath the surface.
Rickie Fowler:  ->  positive

Second favourite, Brooks Koepka, finished fourth here in 2014 but that solid effort is sandwiched by two missed cuts and he doesn't appear to be in scintillating form with figures reading 70-57-32-40 since he finished inside the top-ten at the Travelers Championship in August and he looks plenty short enough to me. The only other player trading at below [30.0] is the rapidly rising Spanish star, Jon Rahm, who's making his event debut this week. The 21-year-old burst on to the scene at the Waste Management Phoenix Open last February, when finishing tied for fifth as an amateur.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. Paul Casey is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Casey has two top-20 finishes at TPC River Highlands in the past two years, including a second-place finish in 2015 when he lost in a playoff.
Casey  ->  positive

-- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic. -- Joe Kaiser  DraftKings value picks  Kelly Kraft  I may be a week late on Kraft as he jumped up the leaderboard last week, but I'm thinking that the putting could still get better than it was last week (where he was putrid on the greens).
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

He’s my pick to take down a stacked field. MY SLEEPER : Bill Haas ($6,900)  Haas has had an under-the-radar, solid season so far with 11 top-25 finishes already to his credit. While he hasn’t registered a win on the year, a T5 at the U.S. Open and top-five placings at both the WGC China event and the WGC Match Play are definitely worth noting.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Although surprisingly, given those stats, only eight third round leaders have successfully converted since 1996 so sitting second or third, a couple of strokes back, looks a great spot to be in through 54 holes. Market Leaders  Matt Kuchar was absolutely exhausted in Canada last week and there's a possibility that Jordan Spieth is still fatigued after the pair's epic duel at Royal Birkdale a fortnight ago but that a big if. The world no.2 took last week off and a well-rested and refreshed Jordan Spieth is most definitely the man to beat and I'm a little surprised he's not a shade shorter than he is.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

So, next for me is William McGirt, who gained his first PGA Tour title just over a year ago by beating a similar field and is capable of doubling up here. At 39th in greens hit, McGirt continues to strike the ball nicely and while he wasn't a factor last weekend, he showed up nicely enough for a couple of rounds on a golf course he admitted was just a little too long for him in the conditions. It may prove to be a positive that McGirt didn't contend at the US Open as he should arrive here relatively fresh and it's his ability to perform on the back of a major which he's either not played in or not contended for which really piques my interest.
McGirt,  ->  positive

Having signed off 2016 in the form of his life, which included an impressive Ryder Cup debut, it’s been a difficult start to 2017 for Koepka, one of the many Nike-branded players who now have licence to experiment with their equipment. Koepka has thrown in some Mizuno, Titleist and Taylor Made to an eclectic bag and it’s probably not helped in terms of finding consistency, although the fundamental reason for his poor play appears to be a bad habit he says he shook off thanks to some long range sessions at Bay Hill last month. KOEPKA, CAULEY OR VARNER TO WIN IS 14/1 - CHECK OUT THE SKY BET SPECIALS HERE!
KOEPKA,  ->  positive

With four reachable par fives and some short par fours, DJ can rack up the fantasy points for you in a hurry. Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9500 FD: $9200  He’s got to win eventually right? Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

2017 has seen Sung-hoon finish 2nd in Houston, where he was beaten by Russell Henley, and Kang was also in the heat of the battle at TPC Potomac when a rainstorm and no wet gear destroyed his momentum - he eventually finished 5th. RESULT: MC  Brian Stuard 0.5pt EW 125/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I'll finish with Brian Stuard who clearly gets El Camaleon and who's undoubtedly on the upward trend. Stuard is a typical case of a PGA Tour journeyman who certainly dined out on his 2016 Zurich Classic of New Orleans victory.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

Danny Lee  World Golf Ranking (#81)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,400)    The defending champ(2015) comes back to defend his title and comes in with some top 5 form in the field. Like Lingmerth he hasn't missed a cut since the PLAYERS and has picked up all three of his 2017 Top 10 finishes since then. From a stats perspective, Lee ranks Top 20 in SG: APP, SG:P, and ranks 9th on the sheet in BoB%.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again. "I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either," Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major.
Stenson  ->  negative

The hope is he can take another step forward here at Copperhead, where he was an impressive 16th on debut in 2012, towards the start of a rookie campaign which saw him climb to the fringes of the world’s top 50 thanks to a number of impressive weeks. You can see how close Cauley came to elite level but, still 10 days short of his 27th birthday, time is on his side and this tournament gives him a genuine chance to kick off a week of celebrations with his first PGA Tour win. As well as that top-20 here when arriving out of form, Cauley has a fourth-place finish in the Arnold Palmer Invitational to his name and having in fact been born in Florida before basing himself in Alabama, this is very much a home game.
Cauley  ->  positive

Will consider for cash. Peasants  Sean O’Hair $7,300  Brandon Stone $7,000  Jhonattan Vegas $6,900  Martin Flores $6,600  Ryan Brehm $6,400  In the middle of writing this I got word that FanDuel will be adding golf on their site. Rumor is that they will have a weird format where you pick 2 teams, one for Thursday/Friday and another for Saturday/Sunday.
Ryan Brehm  ->  positive

They don't appear to correlate visually but all three venues reward excellent ball striking and short games and form at the three courses crosses over really well...  David Toms, Kenny Perry, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson and Jordan Spieth have all recently won this title and the John Deere Classic, staged at Deere Run in Illinois and Brandt Snedeker and Tim Clark have both finished runner-up at both tournaments. Johnson has won this title twice recently so of the eight men to win the last eight editions, four have also won the US Masters - Johnson, Spieth, Adam Scott and Phil Mickelson. Is There an Identikit Winner?
Johnson  ->  positive

Casey should be fresh and ready to continue playing great golf this week. DraftKings Value Pick  Lucas Glover ($8,600)  Glover is playing great golf this year, posting two top 20s in his last four starts. Glover posted a 28th and an 8th in his last two Wells Fargo events, and he also posted a 21stat the Honda this season.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

Ranks first in scrambling on tour and was 1st in strokes gained: tee to green last week in Houston. Justin Rose ($9,200): Outside of Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose might have the most impressive record at Augusta over the past few seasons. Rose has now made nine straight cuts at the Masters since 2007 and has gone 10th-2nd-14th here over the past three years.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Moore frustrated me just a few weeks when having eulogised over him in my preview for the Valspar he promptly missed the cut, before duly popping up with a top 5 next time out at Bay Hill. As I said in my Valspar preview though I do believe Moore has what it takes to deliver at the higher levels of golf and I am encouraged by the way he has rededicated himself to achieve his ultimate goals over the next 5yrs of his career. The results to his change of coach and new fitness regime have been fairly immediate with two top tens in his last four starts and he now returns to a venue he clearly loves and which he firmly believes he can win at.
Moore  ->  positive

However, he’s a total cash game lock at that price. Player to avoid:  Branden Grace $8,200 – Grace is a low ball hitter that won’t have the carry distance needed to contend at Quail Hollow. Plus, conditions look to be softer with the rain so the course could get really long for the South African.
Grace  ->  negative

He's now up to 45th. Number one on that same list was Jon Rahm, with Tommy Fleetwood third - last week's winners on the PGA and European Tours. Brian Harman is also high up so it seems that those who flourished in 2017 have made fast starts this year.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

Ryan Moore and Kevin Na are both affordable high floor plays under $10k, while Billy Horschel, Luke Donald and Jason Dufner all have high made-cut rates and nice course histories under the $8k mark. Tournaments: Russell Henley (see write-up below) is definitely high on my list this week for GPPs, and he’s rarely more than 10% owned. In the $8-$9k range we find Webb Simpson, Graham DeLaet and Bubba Watson who are all capable of high finishes here.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

Eight of the eighteen holes are Par 4s between 400 and 500 yards. Key Stats:  DraftKings Points  Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Proximity (175+ Yards)  Par 4 Scoring (400-500 Yards)  Par 3 Scoring  Strokes Gained: Putting (Bermuda)  Expensive Golfers ($10,000 and Up)  Justin Thomas ($11,300) seems primed for a victory here. Since missing the cut at The Open Championship last year, he’s made 12 starts.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

He's a laidback character and so is Swafford so I don't expect a huge emotional reaction to his win. Asked about how he felt after the victory, Swafford said: "Not so much relief, but maybe a little bit, just of getting in contention a number of times lately and finally being comfortable with it and just executing some great shots down the stretch. Really hit some good ones coming in    "I've been in the last few groups the last few tournaments and had chances and hadn't got it done."
Swafford  ->  positive

He's got some good form in the other Hawaii event and is playing the Plantation Course for the first time in 2013. Leishman was only 23rd back then but it gave him a first look at the course and he's a vastly improved player five years on. Thomas, incidentally, won last year having finished 21st in 2016 so you only have to go back 12 months to find an example to help Leishman's cause.
Leishman  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

- current odds here . My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  You get the feeling that Rickie Fowler means business right now. 2017 saw Fowler play second fiddle to his Jupiter, Florida comrades Dustin Johnson (World Number 1), Brooks Koepka (World Number 8) and Justin Thomas (World Number 3) who between them amassed 11 victories last year including the U.S. Open, PGA Championship and 2 World Golf Championships.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms. Jason Day has had a rocky start to 2017 with one top 10 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and a missed cut.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Hideki Matsuyama went off 12/1 for the last major championship  That has to be taken on board, and he was never in the mix at Bay Hill on his return, but three rounds at the Match Play will have helped speed up his recovery and he showed much better signs in all of them, particularly from tee-to-green. After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Russel Knox ($8,200) – Knox is just another golfer with supreme talent who is priced down in a big way. At $8,200, Russell Knox is one of my favorite plays this week. He ranked 8th in Driving Accuracy Percentage and 9th in Greens in Regulation Percentage in 2016.
Knox  ->  positive

22nd at Augusta, when he went into the final round in 4th spot, 8th at Erin Hills when in the mix all week and 20th last week at Royal Birkdale highlight a player who's having a stellar year. 4th at Riviera, 2nd at Bay Hill and 3rd last month at TPC River Highlands again highlight Hoffman as a player to watch this week and on a potentially receptive, classical golf course where scoring is more than possible, I really like his chances this week. 28th here in 2008, improving results of 16th (2013) and 7th (2015) have followed and it's noticeable that Charley is particularly comfortable on the greens here with +1.10 (2008), +0.88 (2013) and +1.37 (2015) Strokes Gained Putting performances.
Hoffman  ->  positive

From a pure betting perspective, 30-1 on Ryan Moore is great value. In one appearance at Silverado, Moore finished 10th. Moore in a West Coast specialist, and we’ve seen him have success on poa annua greens and in the Fall Swing.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

His price was 8/1. So coming off a runner-up position at Copperhead on course debut last week, where he fell a single shot short of forcing a playoff with Paul Casey (now that would have been interesting), I think that Woods is in a great space to produce what pretty much all of us want to see: his 80th PGA Tour victory and the end of a long and arduous fight back from a catalogue of career-threatening injuries. 8th and 9th for ball-striking across his 2 Florida outings, Woods tightened up his driving last week in Tampa.
Woods  ->  positive

Even though we haven’t seen his best golf for a while, Lovemark is still ranked 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and has accumulated seven top-10s in the past year and a half on tour. With this sort of pedigree, and a game possibly on the upswing, this is a great time to buy low on Lovemark, as he has plenty of upside for the price we are getting this week on DraftKings. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Naturally also look for a comfortable Poa Annua putter as putting from inside 10 feet here is always the toughest on Tour. Winners : 2017: Dustin Johnson (-17); 2016: Bubba Watson (-15); 2015: James Hahn (-6); 2014: Bubba Watson (-15); 2013: John Merrick (-11); 2012: Bill Haas (-7); 2011: Aaron Baddeley (-12); 2010: Steve Stricker (-16). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for The Northern Trust. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Dustin Johnson ($10,800)  DJ hasn’t been in the best for this summer, but he played well enough in the last two majors to intrigue me. After injuring his back and missing the Masters, it’s been a tough road back to the top, but DJ is close.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Per our Trends tool, DJ has averaged 65.17 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) and generated a -0.73 Plus/Minus in his last three trips to this track. That said, Johnson’s heavy 12.5 percent odds to win are currently the best in the field. Newlywed Swag  Unlike Johnson, the newly-married Rory McIlroy has thrived in recent trips to TPC Sawgrass.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

He finished T20 at the Safeway Open, his first start of the season and on his most recent start, at the RSM Classic finished T6. Lovemark shot a final-round 65 to finish just three shots shy of the five players who made it to a sudden-death play-off. If history repeats itself he’s in with a shot this week.
Lovemark  ->  positive

It looks like he is well on track to start playing at the top of his game, and it showed during the first two rounds of the WGC where he was tied for third on the leaderboard entering the weekend. Value Plays  Daniel Berger  Daniel Berger ($7,700)  Berger has great form coming into the PGA Championship, placing top 5 in three of his last five events, including a win defending his title at The St Jude. He was T13 at the WGC Bridgestone going into the weekend when this article was published.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

This season Streelman ranks 11th in total driving, 18th in SG: T2G and fourth in scrambling. Bargain Bin    Dylan Frittelli - $13,400    Frittelli will be making his Valero Texas Open debut this week, but the South African is familiar with the Texan style of golf after playing collegiately as a Longhorn at UT-Austin. The 51st-ranked player in the OWGR doesn’t enter with very inspiring recent form after finishes of T32-MC-MC in his past three starts, but he led the field in SG: Off-the-Tee and ranked 10th in SG: T2G at Harbour Town last week.
Dylan Frittelli  ->  positive

I love this golf course. I've always played well around here, said Casey after his near-miss. "The crowds are great, and it's just nice to get an opportunity to win this, and maybe one day I can get my name in the clubhouse.
Casey  ->  positive

The price is going up but I think we can still consider him in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Chesson Hadley  World Golf Ranking (#80)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,000)  FanDuel ($8,700)    After losing his Tour card in 2016, Hadley won twice on the Web.com Tour last year and is back with the big boys and looking good. He started the fall season with three straight Top 5 finishes before withdrawing from the OHL Classic(illness).
Hadley  ->  positive

He should be limited to GPP only on FanDuel where he is in the mid $10K range. Top Current Form Targets  Cameron Smith  World Golf Ranking (#58)  Vegas Odds (66/1)  Draftkings ($7,400)  FanDuel ($9,200)    Consistency plus DraftKings value is brought me back to Cameron Smith this week. After picking up just six Top 25's all of his rookie season, he has already posted five in his first five events to start the 2017-18 season including two Top 10 finishes and ranks 7th in the field in DraftKings scoring over his last 24 rounds.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
Russell Knox  ->  negative

Howell would have advanced to the Quarterfinals of last week’s Match Play if it weren’t for a last-minute comeback effort from Kiradech Aphibarnrat in the Round of 16, while Howell also place top-15 the week prior at the API. James Hahn - $13,400    Hahn still hasn’t missed a single cut all season, posting a quartet of top-30s in his past eight starts as well. He’s made it through to the weekend in 75 percent of his appearances at the Golf Club of Houston’s Tournament Course, while he currently ranks 14th in SG: Approach, 36th in birdie average and 38th in proximity.
James Hahn  ->  positive

One other point to note with Henley is that he was seventh in the St Jude Classic last season and, as I’ve mentioned before, I really like that as a form pointer. Among the players to help draw comparisons between these two events is Robert Garrigus, who has to go in at 150/1. Garrigus famously lost the plot to hand the St Jude Classic to Lee Westwood in 2010, and he’s been placed here at Copperhead on two of his last four visits.
Garrigus,  ->  positive

Moore in a West Coast specialist, and we’ve seen him have success on poa annua greens and in the Fall Swing. In one appearance at Silverado, Moore finished 10th. From a pure betting perspective, 30-1 on Ryan Moore is great value.
Moore  ->  positive

Fowler has all facets of his game dialed in, especially his approach game, which ranks 4th in the field entering this event. Even though his course history has been boom or bust, I am rostering Fowler in cash and will roster him on 30%-40% of my lineups.

All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he'll be in contention. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Zach Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($6,600)  Sometimes, it's easiest to just not overthink things when it comes to how DraftKings prices golfers each week. I wrote about Hadwin last week and he produced value yet again. This week, his price is even lower for an event where he has posted consecutive top-25 finishes.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Every week is both always and never a Keegan week. https://t.co/d9PvoDStVh
Keegan  ->  negative

Adding to his recent event form, Harman also finished 8th at Q-School when it was hosted here in 2011 so it is fair to say he has an affinity with the setup here. With five straight top-8 finishes which include four top-5’s, it is now time for Harman to capitalise on some special form. Harman has made huge strides as a player over the last couple of years and whilst his win at the Wells Fargo was just his second on the PGA Tour, and his first for three years, he now looks ready to become a perennial winner on Tour.
Harman  ->  positive

Almost two years later, he won by three in 16-under and in-between those efforts, he shot to fame by contending for the US Open at Oakmont before falling to a more than respectable share of 15th having made his way through sectional qualifying. It was no surprise to see him coast through the Web.com Tour last season and Landry has already done just about enough to keep hold of his card for 2019, finishing fourth in the RSM Classic before taking Jon Rahm the distance at the CareerBuilder Challenge, an event which is much more demanding than used to be the case. Bar those two efforts it had otherwise been a disappointing start to the year for the 30-year-old, but he had more on his mind with the arrival of his first child imminent.

La Quinta, set in the Californian desert, looks a very obvious place for him to reach a crescendo. Since the rotation of two rounds at PGA West's Stadium Course, one at the Nicklaus Tournament Course and one at La Quinta CC came in two years ago, Harman has thrived. He shot 18-under to take T11 in 2016 and matched that 72-hole total for third place last year.
Harman  ->  positive

You have to go back a few years but Henry has plenty of course form, with third place in 2012 the best of four top-13 finishes. The 42-year-old has always been the type to pop up in serious contention every so often at enormous odds.
Henry  ->  positive

All things considered, Rory is my top fantasy pick of the week and safe in all formats. Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)  FanDuel ($10,900)  Ranked even higher in my overall model(#1) is Paul Casey as he is the only player in the field who ranks Top 10 in all four categories on my sheet(stats, history, form & DK average last 5). It starts with the course history as Casey has now finished 6th or better in three straight Masters appearances and for his career has made eight of 11 cuts with five Top 10 finishes.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
Smith  ->  negative

Over and over, he's proven to be incredibly reliable, having never missed the cut here in 17 starts and usually finishing inside of the top 30. I was hesitant going into Pebble Beach as he had missed three straight cuts to start 2018, but a 26th place bounce back finish last week has me feeling confident that we can get one more solid effort here out of Choi, which we will need in order to fit DJ in at the top of our lineups this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Ollie Schniederjans  Ollie Schniederjans arrives at the Genesis Open with a great deal of momentum after finishing the Waste Management Phoenix Open with a bogey-free six-under 66 in the final round.
Choi,  ->  positive

The stats show that he's finished second and first in Scrambling for the last two weeks. He's also putting well (3rd SG Putting Phoenix, 19th SGP Pebble) although Mickelson being Mickelson he still can't hide his obsession with driving distance. "I've really had to increase speed to hang with a lot of the younger guys," he said at Pebble.
Mickelson  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Kevin Chappell 2pts EW 28/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here:  One that I like at the top of the market is Kevin Chappell. Steady and motivated after winning his maiden Tour victory at TPC San Antonio back in March, Chappell is a class act in my mind and his results over the past 18 months have been top-notch.
Chappell  ->  positive

Can't get behind Na, either; he's missed the weekend his past three trips here, and his only performance of note (T-9) came in 2007. As for Spieth, Day and McIlroy: they definitely aren't my favorites. Spieth's flat stick continues to be an issue, and though River Highlands' greens will be a respite from the Open dance floors, he's not shown the type of putting consistency that instills conviction.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Pre-event pick, Scott Piercy, sits tied for 30th and five off the lead and he looks to have too much on his plate but James Hahn is close enough if good enough on -8 and I'm happy I followed Paul Krishnamurty in with his three Find Me a 100 Winner selections. Michael Thompson is alongside Piercy after a disappointing second round but Chesson Hadley and Grayson Murray are both alongside Hahn in a tie for 11th and I'm just going to cheer those on for now. 09:35 - March 30, 2017  A weather delay yesterday morning has meant round one of the Houston Open is yet to be completed and that's always frustrating when trying to assess the state of play.
Piercy,  ->  positive

BOTTOM TIER TARGET ($6K/$7K RANGE)  Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports  Russell Knox ($7,100)  The chalk is clearly falling on Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Adam Scott, and Jhonattan Vegas in this range which gives us a few GPP pivot options. I start with Knox as he come sback to TPC Boston with a nice record finishing T26, T12, T15 in his only three trips here. It is a very risky pick as Knox has not been having a good year with just four Top 10 finishes but is clearly comfortable around here.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months. Rory McIlroy, $11700 – Rory has only played once at Riviera (T20 back in 2016), but his incredibly ability to drive the ball and hit solid irons should net him plenty of birdie potential on Riviera.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?
Matt Kuchar  ->  negative

Daniel Berger has a similar profile to Harman but the same can be said of Kisner and Dufner – so many ball-strikers that come to the fore when bombing is taking out of the equation. However, the final vote goes to Tom Hoge. Catching the eye when leading the Sony through 16 holes of the final round, he hasn’t confirmed that form quite yet, whilst still not disgracing himself.
Tom Hoge.  ->  positive

So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.
Reed.  ->  positive

Zach Turcotte: Luke Donald ($7,600)  The tour moves to Florida this week and with that, a lot of players will be headed back home, one being Luke Donald. Donald, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, has been very successful at PGA National over the years. He has posted four top-10 finishes and never missed a cut in six starts at the course.
Donald  ->  positive

And, of course, there was the little matter of landing the $10million bonus that goes to the winner of the season-long FedEx Cup points race. Along with all his other attributes, Spieth also seems very adept at leaving something in the tank for this time of year. He was runner-up on his very first Tour Championship appearance in 2013 and so far during the 2017 Playoffs he's finished second at both The Northern Trust and Dell Technologies Championship before closing with a 65 for tied seventh in last week's BMW Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Russell Henley,  ->  positive

Final selections –  Russell Henley 25/1 1pt EW  Charley Hoffman 33/1 0.5pts EW  Russell Knox 33/1 0.5pts EW  William McGirt 40/1 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter – @DoublebogeyDB6  Facebook – www.faccebook.com/doublebogey6 He looks decent value for a guy showing some decent form. Statswise he ranks sixth in driving accuracy, 31st in GIR and 20th in par 4 scoring.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico. Blair has missed his last two cuts overall but I would still feel OK rostering him at his price this week as he generally makes more cuts than he misses and finished 38th here back in 2015, his only visit to this tournament. Others: Ryan Brehm  High-upside GPP Picks  Thorbjorn Olesen ($7,700): Olesen has multiple European tour wins to his name and has generally been a great finisher over his young career.
Blair  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

If he gets the putter rolling he will certainly be one to watch here. Patrick Reed 11/1  Reed had a great finish to the season with a win and four top 15 finishes from the last seven tournaments. He finished T11 at the Travelers and followed that with another T11 in Rio and a respectable T22 at The Wyndham.
Reed  ->  positive

The weather looks to be mild with very little wind so scoring should be low with the winner averaging around the 20 under mark judging from previous years. Jordan Spieth 5/1  Spieth has been in decent form coming into this event winning in Australia in his last official start beating Ashley Hall and Cameron Smith in a dramatic playoff. The young American played well in the FedExCup Playoffs finishing T10 at The Barclays, solo ninth at The BMW and T17 at The Tour Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

There were just too many errors from him at inopportune moments but he plugged away and a couple of late birdies on Sunday on the way to finishing in a tie for 15th at least got a cheer or two from the galleries. Whether his focus was not quite where it should have been with a US Open just around the corner or simply down to an off-week, Wiesberger is much better than that and I expect to see a positive response. He is a winner already this season on the European Tour in China and the way he plays the game should be ideal for the challenge ahead with his ability to cut some of these punishing holes down to size.
Wiesberger  ->  positive

Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year. With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6
Steele  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Jordan Spieth ($11,600) – The kid absolutely thrives under adversity, and given just how nasty the adversity may get this week, Spieth would be my best bet to shine regardless of the conditions. He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam.
Spieth  ->  positive

That momentum didn’t quite carry over the 2017 calendar year and so far he has let a lot of people down on DraftKings. However, Casey fits this course perfectly, and has the Augusta narrative working in his favor. Casey came second here in 2015 and has back-to-back top 6 results at the Masters.
Casey  ->  positive

Also Consider - Harold Varner III  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Trey Mullinax  Vegas Odds - 200/1  Draftkings - $6,500  FantasyAces - $4,000    I love taking a rookie in this spot as he will most likely be extremely low owned. Oh ya and Mullinax has a tremendous amount of talent and through watching interviews, seems to have it together between the ears. PGA Tour pro Michael Thompson, who had the same college coach, went as far as to say Mullinax's raw power is best compared to Dustin Johnson.
Mullinax  ->  positive

However, I expect the elite names to dominate, with DJ, Thomas and Rahm all likely threats to my chosen front two of Spieth and Rose while Simpson can hopefully get in amongst it too. He shot 63-67 on the weekend three years ago and 69-67 last year so if the big-hitting, two-time PGA Tour winner gets off to a better start he could be dangerous. Further down the betting, I quite like Gary Woodland at 60/1 given his positive past course experience which shows top 10s in both 2016 and 2014.
Simpson  ->  positive

5. Patrick Cantlay  Ladies and gents, meet the next generation’s Paul Casey. Albeit delayed a few years due to injury, Cantlay burst on the PGA scene in 2018 with all of the composure of a long-time veteran, making the cut in literally every event he played (13/13) with eight top-25 finishes and four top-tens.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He was in-contention for much of last week and he was second here in both 2010 and 2012 and he also has a great record at the aforementioned Sony Open. Selections:  Chesson Hadley @ [28.0]  Zach Johnson @ [38.0]  Russel Knox @ [80.0]  Brian Stuard @ [150.0]  Fabián Gómez @ [500.0]    I'll be back on Thursday or Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Zach Johnson (137th in driving distance), Russell Knox (T130) and Adam Hadwin (T90) all finished in the top-5 at Firestone. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Jordan Spieth - $12,000 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 8-1)    Spieth couldn't sink a dang putt last week and he still tied for 13th. He was 45th in strokes gained putting at the Bridgestone and was negative SGP all four days.
Spieth  ->  positive

In the end you have to wonder if Rose was not only playing Garcia, but also the golfing gods that day and his play-off defeat certainly hit Justin hard in the aftermath, despite his best denials. However 10th at Glen Oaks, 10th at TPC Boston on a layout he struggles on and 2nd last week at Conway Farms highlights that Rose has momentum that only Spieth and Rahm can match. Whilst I wonder about Rahm on Bermudagrass greens, I have no hesitation in adding Rose to my betting slip this week as his record at the strategic East Lake is excellent.
Rose  ->  positive

Johnson finished 15th here last season, which isn’t good when there’s only 18 golfers, but he has ripped off three wins and an additional six top-10 finishes in 12 tournaments since the start of June. Jordan Spieth ($10,300): Spieth won the Australian Open two weeks ago and has the second-best Odds to Win (14.3 percent) this week. Spieth dunked it on the Par-3 second hole here last year, earning the all-important DraftKings hole-in-one bonus on his way to a fourth-place finish.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ. There is, however, one player in the high salary range that I really like and should be paired with one of those players –  Players  Marc Leishman (Draftkings – $9,000, FanDuel – $10,000)  Marc is coming off of a 4th place finish in the Australian PGA Championship which took place in early December. He is a very hot golfer right now and has been dominant in the stat department over his last 24 PGA Tour rounds.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
Rickie Fowler.  ->  negative

Daniel Berger - Daniel Berger has finished 16th or better in two of his last three events, which includes last week in Mexico. Berger has now made the cut in six of his last eight events and is 13th in birdie average. Berger also finished 11th last year in the Valspar Championship and should feel at home in this event given he’s from Plantation.
Berger  ->  positive

Brandon Hagy  3. Luke List  MY PICK : Hideki Matsuyama ($10,200)  Hideki’s form has turned around of late as he’s now finished inside the top-15 in each of his last three starts, and he looks to be close to the level of play which vaulted him up the world rankings in late 2016. Matsuyama ranks second in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee this season and is also second on tour in Par 4 Scoring, two stats which line him up for a nice week at Firestone.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

5 PGA Tour victories for Moore shows that he can get the job done on his given day and undoubtedly Ryan will be motivated to keep the recent momentum going as at 71st in the OWGR he needs a strong performance to get a spot in the Dell World Match Play. Moore topped Greens in Regulation at a windswept PGA National 2 weeks ago and was 4th for Strokes Gained Putting at Riviera the week before that where he finished 8th. Ryan shot -3/68 across Thursday/Friday to be 3rd at 36 holes, so he's clearly playing some nice stuff as 14th for Scoring Average, 35th for Bogey Avoidance, 9th for Scrambling from the Rough and 33rd for Strokes Gained Putting highlight more than adequately.
Moore  ->  positive

There is no doubt in my mind that if he can have even an average week on the greens with his long game he can get in to the hunt and at 60-1 for a top 7 place I am winning to take a gamble this happens. RYAN MOORE – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 28th  I’ll be finishing my Masters staking plan with three 3 figure priced players and I’ll start these with Ryan Moore. Moore frustrated me just a few weeks when having eulogised over him in my preview for the Valspar he promptly missed the cut, before duly popping up with a top 5 next time out at Bay Hill.
Moore.  ->  positive

He hasn’t played up to his standards of late, but this price is great for this scoring ability. Ollie Schniederjans $8,100 – I think this price will keep some people off the guy who finished second in last week’s score fest. He is hitting greens at an amazing clip, I think he figured how something with his putting and he scrambled well last week.
Ollie Schniederjans  ->  positive

Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips. He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events.
Campbell  ->  positive

Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
Jimmy Walker  ->  negative

Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again. A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

He’s already proven he can beat Oosthuizen whilst Dufner and Hahn are unpredictable players, who of course can get hot, but in this format, I’ll take Day every time. Rafael Cabrera Bello 66/1 (SkyBet & UniBet) 1pt e/w  So Cabrera Bello was one of the players I had in mind from the outset, but wanted to see who he would be pit against in the Group Stages first. Phil Mickelson, Charles Howell III and Satoshi Kodaira will be his first three opponents.

He does have a nice track record at this event, but his best finish -- a T-4 in 2013 -- came at another venue. As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk.

Kirk.  ->  positive

Rounds of -6/65 and -5/66 got him into 4th spot after 36 holes and eventually he held on for a top-10 after the course became a bomber's paradise over the weekend, qualifying for East Lake by the skin of his teeth. With momentum on his side I can see Na being right in the mix again 2 years down the line. RESULT: T53  Watch these tips on YouTube with Steve Bamford: Golf Betting System YouTube Channel

SUNG KANG – 200-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  For my final pick this week I am going to go slightly off the radar and finish with a 200-1 shot in the form of Sung Kang. One of my reasons for picking Kang this week could be considered somewhat spurious to say the least, but, as I said to someone on twitter only the other day, Page 1, Rule 1 of the Golf Betting Handbook underlined in big bold writing is ‘Follow your Hunches’! My leftfield hunch here is to do with a certain Tiger Woods.
Kang.  ->  positive

Also played well reasonably well at Augusta. Charley Hoffman – He played some great stuff at Augusta, finishing in a tie for 12th. He also made an ace on the 16th at Augusta on Sunday.

My selections are as follows:  Jon Rahm 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  It's the mark of the 23 year-old that Jon Rahm not only attended the CareerBuilder Challenge last week (no doubt ignoring a rather large cheque from Abu Dhabi organisers as a result), but won a tournament which hadn't seen an elite player victorious since Phil Mickelson in 2004. In doing so Rahm, as I mentioned at Kapalua when we were on-board him at 12/1, destroyed a set of well established tournament trends.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

1 has been a shadow of his 2016 self in 2017. It’s completely understandable, but Day recently missed the cut at the U.S. Open and the Travelers Championship and has yet to show that he can putt nearly as well as he did last season. • • •  Gerry Ahern  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
Day  ->  negative

Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past. At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago). Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead.
Hadley  ->  positive

His T3 at the John Deere Classic came at the par 71, 7,258-yard course. Bryan struggles off of the tee distance wise but showed last year he can compete with just about anyone with a wedge in his hand. If you’re looking for a cheap GPP flier there are plenty of worse options out there.
Bryan  ->  positive

Rose will look to bounce back from a below-average putting year and taking a month off may be just what he needed. If Rose has just an average putting tournament, he will be on the first page of the leaderboard on Sunday and there is no telling how low he can go if the flat stick gets hot. Value Picks and Sleepers  Daniel Berger ($8,800)  Berger is coming off a 14th-place finish in last week's ToC and a runner-up in the WGC HSBC Championship back in October.
Rose  ->  positive

He's an excellent play in all formats this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Marc Leishman  Leishman continues to show solid form this season and that was once again confirmed his last time out with a T13 finish at the PGA Championship. Since his last missed cut in early May, Leishman has added four Top 20s, a Top 10 and another Top 5 to his 2017 PGA Tour resume.
Leishman  ->  positive

He hasn't had much success here in the last two years missing both cuts(could help with own % this week) but did have a T33 in 2015 and what stands out more than anything is that he is good in Windy AF conditions. Who the Stats Like  Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($9,800)  FanDuel ($11,400)    Casey comes in #17 in my overall model this week thanks to missing the cut here in his one trip in the last five years but stands out statistically ranking #3 in that model. On the sheet, he ranks 4th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, 5th in Strokes Gained: Approach, and 5th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking.
Casey  ->  positive

In nine career starts, he has notched six top-15 finishes, making him an excellent value pick this week. Jason Rouslin -- Kevin Kisner ($6,900)  Arriving in Shanghai off a decent performance in Malaysia, Kisner comes to China and the Sheshan International Golf Course where he placed second last year. With that in mind, and a great value, I like Kisner to jump start his 2016-2017 season with a top 10 finish this week.
Kisner  ->  positive

315 yards (3rd), 53.6% fairways (11th), 77.8% greens in regulation (2nd), 31"4" proximity to hole (4th), 56.3 % scrambling (13th), 1.64 putts per GIR (3rd). 2015, Jordan Spieth (-9). 282 yards (16th), 64.3% fairways (7th), 65.3% greens in regulation (9th), 33"4" proximity to hole (4th), 66.7 % scrambling (8th), 1.72 putts per GIR (9th).
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

As with McGirt, the plan is to place two lay orders, for 12 units at [15.0] and 20 units at [3.0], to secure an overall profit should either hit just the first target. Back Martin Flores (w/o Scott/Fowler/Garcia) 1u ew @ 110/1  Back Martin Flores for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ 5/1  Rather than another back-to-lay, the final pick is preferred as an each-way selection in our speciality market excluding the top-three contenders - Adam Scott, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia. It seems certain that at least one of this rock-solid trio will be in contention, so finishing seventh or eighth in the event could very plausibly earn a place payout.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

If he can get the ballstriking dialed in this week, he could be in for a nice payday. Jeff Bergerson: J.B. Holmes ($7,100)  As long as DraftKings is going to offer bargain basement pricing for some of the absolute best players in the world, I am going to buy. Holmes has not been lighting the world on fire thus far this year, but his worst finish since last summer is T35.
Holmes  ->  positive

One of his publicly-stated goals is to pick up a win before Augusta. Of course, that's probably on the mind of every golfer in the field but Spieth usually accomplishes his goals. Dating back to last year's DEAN & DELUCA, Spieth has gained 3 or more strokes over the field in 16-of-17 PGA TOUR events.
Spieth  ->  positive

Who checks both of these boxes? England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special.
Ian Poulter,  ->  positive

For all the imponderables this event presents, what previous renewals tell us is that those ranking inside the top five in greens will have outstanding chances to win if they can manage their mistakes. On the strength of his first two visits, his improvement since the second of them, and his form all year, Thomas is firmly expected to be one of those five. Another point which could be significant is how diligent Thomas has been in his homework.
Thomas  ->  positive

Justin Rose ($9,200): Outside of Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose might have the most impressive record at Augusta over the past few seasons. Rose has now made nine straight cuts at the Masters since 2007 and has gone 10th-2nd-14th here over the past three years. He comes in having not missed a cut in 2017 and slightly under the radar.
Rose  ->  positive

Jamie Lovemark, Charles Howell III, Francesco Molinari & Phil Mickelson – Gleaning too much from stats from 2017 is somewhat challenge, with so many players having such limited samples, however it seems like Lovemark is starting to tailor his game to what the course demands. Historically a bomber who eats up Par 5s, Lovemark has taken couple yards off his drives and has been drastically improved with his irons (43rd SG: ATG) and putting (19th SG: PUTT). Fresh off consecutive Top 10s, and a T6 here last season, I’m hoping the former NCAA champion and Haskins award winner can converge his new found skills with his classic affinity for Par 5 domination and finally come through on his massive potential.
Lovemark,  ->  positive

He won the Safeway Open in October and finished 13th in the CIMB. Steele leads the tour so far through this short season in strokes gained: tee-to-green, he’s fourth in strokes gained: approach, fourth in driving distance – bombing it at an average of 328, and ninth in birdie or better %. The two tournaments he last played were in October, so it’s just a matter of Steele finding what he had during that stretch.
Steele  ->  positive

This week the winner will need to go low. Bob Harig: Haas ($10,500)  Two of Haas' six career PGA Tour victories have come at this tournament, and while the courses might be different, the same basic principle applies: this is almost like stadium golf in the desert, with perfect weather and conditions. Haas is coming off a tie for 13th in Hawaii and he's shot every round he's played at this tournament under par going back to 2008.
Haas  ->  positive

Scott is one of the best ball strikers in the game today and will be able to stick his approach shots close if he can keep his drives on the fairway. One of my favorite bargain plays this week is Xander Schauffele ($6,400). The knock on Schauffele is his ball striking but his approach game has steadily improved over his last three starts.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Another top 30 should be in the cards this week. Bill Haas… If we think distance is muted this week, than Haas becomes a major factor on my board. With top 25s in each of his last three starts, he’s definitely worth a look.
Haas…  ->  positive

The results to his change of coach and new fitness regime have been fairly immediate with two top tens in his last four starts and he now returns to a venue he clearly loves and which he firmly believes he can win at. Moore’s record at Augusta stems back to a 13th place finish as an amateur and he has subsequently delivered three further top 15 finishes including a best finish of 9th last year. As a shorter hitter If the conditions do end up as being firm and fast this will no doubt help Ryan, however last years event started off after a deluge on the Wednesday and this didn’t prevent him from having a great week.
Moore’s  ->  positive

16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. RESULT: T73  Chesson Hadley 2pts EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I always like Chesson Hadley when he's on a roll and like Luke List he's certainly a player who deserves a victory this season.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Na is always a safe pick on Bermuda greens especially against a weak field like this. Sticking with our "studs and duds" approach this week, you can fit Na, Johnson, and Steele in a lineup and have and average of $7,233 left to spend on your three remaining spots. Ryan Palmer ($8,000)  Ryan Palmer loves this tournament.
Johnson,  ->  positive

Ball-striking does tend to be the order of the day around this course so Lucas Glover’s continued excellence from tee-to-green earns him a place on the shortlist, while Seung-yul Noh’s form in the St Jude Classic catches the eye and he could leave behind a modest record at this layout if all the pieces come together as they’re threatening to do. However, I’ll return to a young man who is something of an old favourite in the exceptionally talented Bud Cauley. I’ve written before about what’s already been an up-and-down career for a player who took a Spieth-like route to the PGA Tour before Spieth himself, so I’ll give you the abridged version this time.
Bud Cauley.  ->  positive

That being said, Perez has been excellent this year out of the rough (40’2” to the pin, 22nd) and is great with a short iron in his hand, and like Ollie is better (relatively) outside 10’ than inside. On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG. Perez has consistently been a great play on DraftKings, because he’s one of the best in the field at putting up birdies.
Perez  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason. Before his 60th-place finish at TPC Sawgrass, Fowler had finishes of 4th, 1st, 16th, 12th, 3rd, and 11th (Zurich team play notwithstanding). To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

The one thing he will be looking to improve the most is the putting and if he gets that going, and I think he will, he will be atop the leaderboard late Sunday afternoon. Jason Dufner  World Golf Ranking (#46)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($7,800)  FanDuel ($10,100)  If you are looking for a cash game play on DraftKings, it will be hard to avoid Jason Dufner. He comes back with some excellent course history(for the price) as he has a Top 25 finish in five straight trips and a Top 30 finish in nine straight trips to Innisbrook Resort.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

The slower/softer greens here should help and he’s simply too cheap for his talent level. Zac Blair ($6,400): Blair brings consistency this week and a lot of good play at corollary courses. He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico.
Blair  ->  positive

This week is very different from others. For one, Spieth struggled heavily in his strong suit last week (putting) and I can not see him struggling there for two straight weeks. Secondly, he is the best player in the field and it really isn’t close.
Spieth  ->  positive

Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

He's now up to 45th." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Kyle Stanley e.w. @ 50/1  Six years ago, Kyle Stanley was at the centre of two of the most incredible back-to-back weeks in the history of the PGA Tour.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

I was pleased the model found that the games of those seven are quite suitable to this course since most of them have been playing to form lately, and if they keep it up they have good shots at being near the top on Sunday. And Snedeker, Thomas, Reed and Casey all have something to prove after last week. Pinterest Gregory Shamus  Expert Analysis : Admittedly, a tad torn.
Casey  ->  positive

John Deere Recap:  Sadly, the top LU had another loss this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

While he’s never played the FESJ before, lack of course history is a regular occurrence for the son of Titleist’s CEO. Danny Lee: $7,200  D. Lee has finished top 10 in two of his last three starts, and the New Zealand native has made the cut in both of his FESJ starts. He’s 48th in strokes gained: approach, which has him respectably positioned in this weak field.
Danny Lee:  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Martin Piller  ->  positive

Therefore in addition to the usual series of back-to-lays listed below, a Top 20 Finish bet is recommended on each. Back Brian Gay 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [8.0]  Back Brian Gay for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ [6.0]    My first pick is a classic case in point. Brian Gay is playing well this term, doing this column a favour when registering the second of consecutive top-sixes in the Texas Open.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

He ranks in the top 34 of both of our key stats and finished last week ranking 8th in strokes gained tee-to-green and 10th in strokes gained around the green so his all round game is clearly in good nick. Again I’d have Kokrak a marginal favourite based on recent form and think this one has been priced on name recognition. Recommended bets:  Tommy Fleetwood – 2 points outright @ 25.0 (lay back 3 points at 5.0)  Bubba Watson – 1 point outright @ 46.0 (lay back 4 points @ 7.0)  Emilliano Grillo – 2 points top 10 @ 5.5  Lucas Glover – 5 points to beat Ryan Moore @ 2.00  Jason Kokrak – 3 points to beat Louis Oosthuizen @ 2.20  Click here for Matchbook’s latest golf markets.
Kokrak  ->  positive

The first potential value that stands out on this chart is Patrick Rodgers who has roughly 60:1 odds to win this week despite a mere $7,000 price tag. The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat. Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each.
Daniel Summerhays  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Leishman and Harman have superseded him only because of what happened last week and given the contrast in courses, plus the fact that 17th was a perfectly fair effort from Kisner, I'd prefer to focus on all the other evidence which points towards our man. Third at the TOUR Championship last September and fourth in his only subsequent start of 2017, there's every chance Kisner is up there throughout this week and he's worthy of a decent each-way bet. Sticking with the idea that a Kapalua warm-up is advantageous, the two at big prices I like who featured last week are Wesley Bryan and Ryan Armour.
Kisner,  ->  positive

According to FantasyNational, Spieth is seventh in the field in his past 24 rounds in strokes gained: approach among players in the field. There's no guarantee that Spieth hits fairways, but if the wind isn't problematic, he has the profile to dominate. Sergio Garcia ($9,400 | 18/1) - Garcia's odds have shortened from 20/1 as of Friday to 18/1, but his FanDuel price is locked in.
Spieth  ->  positive

Looking at the salary gap on DraftKings between the two, I will take the discount with Rahm as new courses have not even come close to stopping this kids momentum early in his career. Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#34)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,300)    Believe it or not, Molinari actually comes in a tick higher than DJ in the form ranks this week. I look at each player's last five events and average their finish positions.
Molinari  ->  positive

The course isn't made solely for the bomber, but JB Holmes has lost a play-off here, Phil always plays it well, and as a reasonably long par-72 it does set up well for big hitters like Finau if they can stay out of trouble. Given that Finau was second in greens in regulation at the Valspar and first at the Arnold Palmer, the latter played on a course lined by hazards as is this one, the long-game appears in shape to avoid disaster and only slight improvement with the putter - which has let him down often this year - is needed. There's still every indication that Finau can properly establish himself as a world-class talent and he's got enough about him to stick around and potentially add his name to the list of Augusta invites.
Finau  ->  positive

Finally another point that caught my eye is that Kirk has a top 5 finish at the Nicklaus designed Muirfield village host of the Memorial, an event which has been won by Dufner and Lingmerth over recent years, who finished 1st & 2nd in this event respectively in 2016. RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open.
Knox.  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick. However, he began the year hot, looking more and more like his old self, especially with his putter.
Scott  ->  positive

The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois. -- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic.
Campbell  ->  positive

-- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons. I would not roster Kirk in cash games, but for GPP purposes his ownership will be extremely low.
Kirk  ->  positive

Rahm has ranked number one for Birdie Average on the PGA Tour over the last six months (averaging an impressive 4.62) and this set-up looks absolutely perfect for such a talented and aggressive birdie machine. Rahm may be playing the event for the first time but his new caddie, Adam Hayes, knows the venue well. He was on Jonathan Byrd's bag when he won here in 2010 in dramatic style.
Rahm  ->  positive

Chapultepec favors those who would be something in a long drive competition (at least in 2017), but few players will hit driver this week. Phil Mickelson took his out of the bag last season, and DJ, Rahm, JT and Rory almost exclusively hit irons on the tee box. When asked if he would take driver out of his bag, DJ responded: “I really could.
Rahm,  ->  positive

I’ll have Webb Simpson on call if needed. Luke List & Jon Rahm – Luke List has been lurking long enough, he’s nearing a breakthrough, and I want to make sure I cash in when it finally happens. He just needs to learn how to play the weekends a little bit better because HOT STARTS, he’s got those down.
Luke List  ->  positive

Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
Dufner  ->  positive

Brian Campbell  3. Patrick Reed  MY PICK : Kevin Na ($8,000)  Na has endured a slightly up and down season, punctuated by a social media rant at the U.S. Open where he complained about the fescue being too tall. Since that time (and perhaps motivated by it), Na has actually strung together some decent golf results, including a T22 his last time out at the Quicken Loans.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

He had a good start to his PGA Tour season with respectable T8 at The Sanderson Farms last week shooting 67,65 in the first two rounds. Last season on the web.com Murray was averaging just under 320 yards off the tee ranking fourth in driving distance. He also ranked fifth in putting average, third in par 4 scoring and first in par 5 scoring, all these stats bode well around here.
Murray  ->  positive

He keeps himself out of trouble, is an elite iron player, and seems to have found a groove with his putter (minus one Sunday at Harbour Town). Dufner wants to lock up his President’s Cup spot this week, and can do so with a win. Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events.
Dufner  ->  positive

Marc Leishman did us a huge favour when winning at 45/1 last week but he led from gun to tape and I fancy that would have taken a lot out of him. I'll stay in the 'without Spieth' market and finish off with a punt on Webb Simpson at 33s (he's 40s with). As the each-way terms are still 1/5 1,2,3,4,5 with Spieth taken out, a top six finish for Simpson gets us in the money.
Simpson  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Emiliano Grillo ($6,900)  Grillo has had a tough year, punctuated by a stretch of four missed cuts in five starts to end the regular season. Grillo’s tee to green game hasn’t been that bad, however, and he bounced back nicely last week with a T29 at Glen Oaks — where he ranked T3 in Greens in Regulation and gained over 5.8 strokes on the field in his approaches. While the putter has continued to be a sore spot for him, even a decent week with the flat-stick could produce a big fantasy score if he continues his hot ball striking.
Grillo  ->  positive

We’re down to 15 so now we can get serious! The Contenders  Here are the remaining 15 players, in order of how I priced their winning chances:  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Louis Oosthuizen  Brandt Snedeker  Shane Lowry  Ian Poulter  Zach Johnson  JB Holmes  Hideto Tanihara  From these I’ve derived my following tips:  Tip #1 - Winner  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Tip #2 - Top5  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Tip #3 - Top10  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Tip #4 - Top20  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Tip #5 - Top South African  Louis Oosthuizen  Tip #6 - Top USA  Rickie Fowler  Brandt Snedeker  Summary  Sergio Garcia should win; Rickie Fowler the closest challenger;  Rose & Matsuyama can be expected to go well without quite making it;  Stenson & Scott should safely place Top10;  Casey & Leishman can be relied upon as Top20 bets;  Snedeker, for me, ranks a value-reeking 2nd in the Top USA market, behind Fowler;  Oosthuizen should easily be Top South African;  Best longshot - take your pick(s) among: Lowry,Poulter, Zach JB & Tanihara. Cheers & Good Luck with your golf punting  Mike (@SmartGolfBets)  Monday 17 July
Sergio Garcia  ->  positive

He holed it, a portent for his clutch putting at future Ryder Cups. In the end it proved academic as Padraig Harrington stormed past him but Poulter said it was one of the best weeks of his life. He loves the venue and second place at Sawgrass and T9 (despite poor final round) at the Scottish Open on Sunday shows that he’s still a factor in big events.
Poulter  ->  positive

He's played well here when not at his best and with course form figures that read 53-5-6-6-26-17, I thought he was well worth following in the place markets especially. Selections:  Jordan Spieth @ 10/1 (Sportsbook)  Jon Rahm @ [24.0]  Brendan Steele @ [46.0]  Brendan Steele in the top five, top ten and top 20 markets @ 9/1, 4/1 and 15/8 (Sportsbook)  I'll be back on Thursday afternoon or Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

He has the 7th best SG: Approach (as well as SG: Putting), sits 31st in Scrambling% , and is 14th in Par-3 scoring. DraftKings-wise, Fowler always makes a good play in the same vein as Lefty, because he makes lots of birdies. On par-5s, Fowler’s made Birdie or Better a whopping 55.83% (4th), and his overall birdie average of 4.44 is currently 4th on Tour.
Fowler  ->  positive

The only part of his game lacking at the moment is his around-the-green work, which, as mentioned, is devalued this week. Chesson Hadley  With the injection of talent we’re getting from overseas, it will be very easy to overlook some of the lower-level American players who played well on the West Coast Swing. With two T25s (and an MC) in his three previous starts at PGA National, Hadley comes to Florida on another level than in those years.
Hadley  ->  positive

Others to consider: Sung Kang, Adam Hadwin You can do a lot worse than Herman if you are trying to build a few stars and scrubs lineups. Herman will certainly be extremely low owned and offers a lot of salary relief (especially on FanDuel).
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

At the WGC-Dell Match Play, where he finished T9, Casey said: "The beautiful thing about Augusta is I know the shots I need to hit, so it's just the case of working on a few things and a few key shots, some hooky, draw 3 woods for the tee shots on 10, a lot of distance control, speed control with the putter." Summing up why he does so well there, Casey said in 2016: "It certainly suits my game. I think the fact I've got a high ball flight; the ability to hit the driver a little bit right to left.
Casey  ->  positive

Last year Spieth had 12.5 percent odds to win and finished with a +21.86 Plus/Minus in the tournament. Current Form  In Spieth’s six most recent tournaments, he has averaged a monster 103.92 PPT with an amazing +24.54 Plus/Minus and incredible 80 percent Consistency. Spieth’s 67.6 Recent Adjusted Round Score and 27.5 Recent Adjusted Putts Per Round are currently tied for ninth in the Masters field, and his 18.0 Recent Adjusted Birdie Average is tied for fourth.
Spieth  ->  positive

If he’s motivated, Spieth is my pick to win. Looking at my recent strokes gained model, Spieth ranks seventh. Justin Thomas ($10,200)  Thomas shot a record-setting 63 on Saturday at the U.S. Open, but just didn’t have his best on Sunday.
Spieth  ->  positive

Yes, he missed the cut on his one and only visit here in 2014, but back then the Texan was hugely disappointed to have missed out to Zach Johnson at Kapalua - a tournament he feels he should have won. 3 years on Spieth still clearly has demons to deal with, but his Greens in Regulation, Proximity to Hole and Strokes Gained Putting numbers were exemplary last week. Cut-out the stupid tactical calls and mental errors and Spieth will undoubtedly be in the mix - his disappointing PGA Tour results must be a bug-bear by now and we know how dangerous he is when he has a point to prove.
Spieth  ->  positive

That should be a great fit for El Camaleón Golf Club. Cheng Tsung Pan ($6,000): Sticking to the Web.com Tour grads, this Washington Husky is extremely accurate off the tee. Like I've mentioned a hundred times already, that's what I prefer to target at this week's short track.
Pan  ->  positive

The main stats that stand out here are driving distance, par 4 and par 5 scoring, GIR and good previous/current form. Hideki Matsuyama 11/1  Matsuyama was outstanding last Sunday in the final round in Firestone shooting a flawless 61 to win his second WGC title and his third PGA Tour win this season. Its hard to find any fault in any part of his game from driving it bullet straight to stitching his approach shots and holing everything on the greens.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

This is a home game for Walker and Hossler isn't too far from Austin where he spent his college days.

Johnson sealed his third win in consecutive starts when taking the title 12 months ago and already ranked World No.1 at the time, whilst Day was also coming off the back of a win at the Arnold Palmer and was ranked 2nd in the world before his win here in 2016 took him to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings. With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years.
Day  ->  positive

Prior to his injury, Peterson finished T18 at the 2015 Heritage and has form on a course that suits his game. 1pt each-way John Peterson at 150/1 Paddy Power (7 places; 1/5 odds)  It’s almost three years since Billy Horschel won the FedEx Cup, a natural dip in form combined with a switch in equipment manufactures has kept him out of the winner’s enclosure but that could change this week. The 30-year-old lost in a playoff at the RSM Classic and finished T4 at the Honda Classic both on courses that share similarities with Harbour Town.
Peterson  ->  positive

In just four starts here, over the last four years, he's finished 45th, seventh, fourth and fifth and his form so far in 2017 has been respectable enough. Billy Horschel's Greens In Regulation stats have been impressive of late and he'll feel he should have perhaps won here in 2013 when he was beaten into second by another of my fancies, last week's Puerto Rico Open winner, D.A Points. It's asking a lot for Points to double-up after last week but [200.0] was just too big and so too was the [250.0] I took about Cameron Tringale, who course form figures read a very respectable 73-8-16-4-5-57.

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

He made the top four at Riviera in 2011, added top 25s in 2012 and 2015 and had a final-round hole-in-one on the way to T10 last year. At a three-figure price, Patrick Rodgers certainly makes appeal. The former Stanford standout was fourth at Torrey Pines and T10 at the RSM Classic in his final start of 2016.
Patrick Rodgers  ->  positive

20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Adam Scott ($12,200)  We thought that Scott would be less great without the long putter. Proving that length isn't everything, he leads the Tour in strokes gained, putting.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

He has played well around TPC Summerlin in the past finishing T2 in 2013 and didn’t shoot worse than a 68 all week including a final round 65 and finished T28 in 2014. Ishikawa looks to be in flying form and after playing well here twice before, he could another player to keep an eye on at generous odds. Final selections –  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 18/1  Scott Piercy 1pt EW 28/1  Grayson Murray 0.5pts EW 55/1  Ryo Ishikawa 0.5pts EW 70/1  Total staked = 6pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf.
Ishikawa  ->  positive

He is 11th overall in my stats model thanks to ranks of 12th in SG: OTT + APP, 3rd in GIR from 200+, 4th in BoB% and 11th in Bogey Avoidance. On top of the stats, Horschel has some excellent course history including two straight Top 5 finishes and three in his last four trips to the Oaks Course. With Hadwin and Donald likely commanding a ton of ownership, Horschel makes a projected low owned GPP play.
Horschel  ->  positive

The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Jason Day ($10000): Although it’s very appealing to get Jason Day as a “sneaky” play with his price coming as only the fifth-highest, back-to-back champions don’t happen at the PLAYERS. Day has yet to show that he’s regained his world number one form, coming T22 at Augusta and his best finish coming back at Pebble Beach with a T5.
Jason Day  ->  negative

The T4 came just two starts ago in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines and there was much to like about that performance on the stats; he was 8th in Driving Accuracy, 4th for Greens in Regulation and even had a healthy positive Strokes Gained: Putting figure of 1.731. In Vegas last November, Bradley revealed: "My game feels really good. I've been playing good for a while now.
Bradley  ->  positive

Video element not supported Kevin Chappell makes an ace at the API  Throw in finishes of 14th and 24th, the latter on debut six years ago, plus second in the PLAYERS, second at Jack's place in the Memorial and second to McIlroy in the TOUR Championship, and it's clear that there's a lot in favour of a player who tends to produce his best golf against the very best. Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous. Like Johnson, he's of a standard slightly higher than those around him in the betting, and I don't see that there are any real doubts over the current state of his game, or the suitability of the golf course.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

From an altitude perspective the $954,297 dollars earned at TPC Summerlin linked to his Scottsdale, Arizona residence highlights a player more than capable in thin air surroundings. Result: T29  Sung Kang 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Sung Kang continues to press for an International Team Presidents Cup spot and his 5th place last week at TPC Potomac certainly helped with the cause. He still has a way to go if he wants to reach Nick Price's team, but unlike others above him in the rankings he has real momentum in 2017 and at a course where web.com graduates have had much success in the past - Scott Stallings, Ted Potter Jnr, Jonas Blixt and Danny Lee were all grads - I think Kang can follow in their footsteps this week.
Kang  ->  positive

Here's a look at our top DraftKings plays and value picks for the Travelers Championship. Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Par 4 Scoring, Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:App), Approaches 150-175 Yards, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G)  Top-Tier Plays  Patrick Reed ($9,300)  The American Ryder Cup star, dubbed the "American Eagle" by many, is back on the right track after losing it for a little bit. From Week 7 to Week 16 (six events), Reed had three missed cuts and did not finish better than 38th.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups.
Day's  ->  positive

Course Horse. Scott Hend… Built in the same mold as guys like Luke List, Thomas Pieters, Harold Varner III, Grayson Murray, Patrick Rodgers, etc… these guys all have elite upside when it comes to playing courses with easy par 5s. The form of guys like Pieters and Rodgers are a bit concerning, but Hend has been playing well, worldwide, over the past few months.
Luke List,  ->  positive

Having made clear that neither DJ nor Spieth make quite enough appeal at the odds, it really didn't take me long to settle on the strongest selection here. Rickie Fowler is a top-25 driver in distance terms and his career is on a path which suggests that major glory is very close now, so he gets a confident headline vote. Now 28, Fowler has seven wins worldwide, from the US to Korea, stopping in Scotland and Abu Dhabi inbetween.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

When I’m on the fence, I jump off and wait for another day. J.B. Holmes: Nothing to point at in the form department but gamers love former champs. Four years ago I’m not sure he had the same wife or life.
J.B. Holmes:  ->  negative

For starters, as mentioned more than once of late, he's playing really well. Horschel was fourth at the Honda, despite a closing bogey, and put a blip at the Valspar behind him by finishing 13th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last time out. On both occasions it was Horschel's customarily reliable long-game which provided the foundation, but there was also definite improvement around the greens at Bay Hill, where he ranked second for scrambling and 16th in strokes-gained putting.
Horschel  ->  positive

Tom Jacobs – Jason Kokrak to be the First Round Leader 55/1  This is a simple one for me. Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early. Whilst question marks still remain as to whether Kokrak is a winner at this level, he has had plenty of near misses and will probably get over the line eventually.
Kokrak  ->  positive

In his past nine appearances here, Dufner has not finished outside the top 30 once, and during that time, he has posted four top-20s. In his past five tournaments this year, Dufner has made every cut and posted three top-20s. At $7,800, Dufner is a great cash game option but also has some GPP upside.
Dufner  ->  positive

21st on debut here in 2013 was followed by 12th a year later and although he's not improved on that since, he arrives here this year in far better overall form and with a whole cabinet full of trophies acquired since then. RESULT: Winner  Kevin Chappell 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Jason Dufner 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (6 places, 1/5 odds):  A field of the highest quality this week may well produce a fairly obvious winner - indeed 3 of the past 4 winners have been single-figure chances before obliging - and with 2 decent bets on a couple of the shorter-priced players that doesn't leave a massive amount of room for manoeuvre.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Spieth, unlike many of the top-ranked golfers, made the cut at the U.S. Open and finished 35th, thanks to a final round 69 on Sunday. Prior to that, Spieth had two consecutive top-15 finishes, including a near miss at the DEAN and DELUCA Invitational, where he finished T2 — just one shot back of the winner, Kevin Kisner. World No.
Spieth  ->  positive

With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua. He can go lights out on and around the greens which is often crucial on a coastal course.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Firing long into the green is disastrous and will leave players with a cold-blooded, downhill, side-sloping putt. Players To Watch  It wasn’t that long ago when Rory McIlroy just rolled out of bed and woke up awesome. After McIlroy won the FedEx Cup last year, expectations for 2017 were justifiably sky-high.
Rory McIlroy  ->  negative

This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson  ->  positive

The Anti-Specialists  The specialists above are positive in all five angles, but which golfers are the opposite and show a poor course fit? Anirban Lahiri  Keegan Bradley  Lahiri seems to struggle with tough courses and long courses while Bradley sees a big dip on bermuda. I don’t think either are must fade, but neither are popping off the page, either.
Keegan Bradley  ->  negative

In 14 starts here, he's backed five top-10 finishes, missing the cut only once, and it was encouraging to see a return to bermuda provoke an improved putting display when he finished 14th at the Valspar Championship last week. Zach Johnson should go well after another promising effort last week  Johnson remains an above-average putter, but it's a while since he's been a deadly one and combined with the fact that he cannot overpower any golf course, that explains why too often he's been on the fringes of contention without adding to his impressive haul of 12 PGA Tour wins. Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016.
Johnson  ->  positive

And I also stick with my theory that his motivation will be 100% this week as he still sees winning the PGA Tour Player of the Year award as a huge goal. Again asked about it on Sunday in Chicago, Spieth elaborated by saying, "For me if I go out next week - not only win the FedEx Cup, I think I have to win the tournament next week to be Player Of The Year or at least have a chance to be Player Of The Year and that's really - that's our MVP, that's the most important award." With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running.
Spieth  ->  positive

Also T13 and T17 in the last two editions of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Harman was T8 in the 2015 Players Championship so has a decent bank of Florida form under his belt. A strong player in the wind (he led and then finished third in the 2018 opener in Hawaii in very gusty conditions), Harman seems to fit the bill in so many ways this week and the 45/1 looks real each-way value. More on the Euros below but, as for the other Americans, Rickie Fowler was 18/1 when winning last year so the 15/2 for a defence looks grim.
Harman  ->  positive

However, it’s another PGA Tour maiden who catches my eye at a bigger price with Bud Cauley considered great value at 100/1. Cauley struck the ball really well on his way to a top-10 finish at the Heritage last week and the move to TPC San Antonio, where he’s twice played well in just three visits, may see him step up another level and contend. He’s done so several times lately, including when just in behind Garcia and Koepka at the Nelson last summer, and at 58th of over 200 players ranked for driving distance he gets it out there far enough from the tee.
Cauley  ->  positive

Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me. Ryan Moore 100/1 (Betfred & Skybet 6 places 1/4 odds, Betfair & PaddyPower 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  A disappointing season for Ryan Moore seems to be on the up of late, finishing inside the top-28 in each of his last three events. At the WGC Bridgestone Invitational Moore opened up with a round of 73 and it looked like his poor form would continue, however over the next three rounds he broke 70 in each and finished T28.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Some would argue that he’s not proven himself in this company but this is a player who finished fifth at the US Open and T20 at the Open Championship – he’s got plenty of game. Schauffele’s last five starts have produced finishes of 5-14-35-1-20, which includes a nerveless win at The Greenbrier Classic where he birdied the 72nd hole for the victory. Schauffele is a terrific driver of the ball, 19th in driving distance and 30th in strokes gained off the tee and his game reminds me past champion Keegan Bradley.
Schauffele’s  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Scott Brown – $9,800  Scott Brown is drawing a lot of attention from the DFS golf world this week, being tagged the 4th most on FanShareSports.com. Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes.
Scott Brown  ->  negative

Back Brian Gay 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [8.0]  Back Brian Gay for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ [6.0]    My first pick is a classic case in point. Brian Gay is playing well this term, doing this column a favour when registering the second of consecutive top-sixes in the Texas Open. He was born in the Lone Star State and very much worth considering returning to TPC Four Seasons.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

Henley first made his name on Tour as a brilliant putter so if he brings his best long game then he should be suited to the test. Kevin Chappell will be on a few more radars having won in May and also finishing 4th last week. Chappell has long been my idea of a U.S. Open winner such is the consistency of his long game across 4 days on a tough course.
Chappell  ->  positive

Pinterest Sam Greenwood/Getty Images  Other than that, nothing too egregious from the professor. Finau and Haas are solid, safe picks. Finau's quietly put together a strong campaign, ranking eighth in strokes gained: tee-to-green and fifth off-the-tee, and though he hasn't posted many top-10 finishes, Haas has been a top-25 machine in 2017 (11 in 17 events).
Haas  ->  positive

After last week’s success and his recent history on this course, Palmer and +5000 odds is with a strong consideration. While the sample size is quite small this season, Palmer has finished in the top-15 in three of his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Palmer really hit the ball well last week and has now made the cut in three of his last four events.
Palmer  ->  positive

Horschel is one to follow when hot and Win/Win scenarios of late have become a fairly regular occurrence. RESULT: T34  Kyle Stanley 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Kyle Stanley is another I like this week. 27th here when playing as a web.com Tour player back in 2010 on course debut, he was 18th after 54 holes before a late Sunday pairing with K.J.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here. We know low scoring is Reed’s forte, with three of his five wins coming by way of double-digit scores. He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions.
Reed  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Ian Poulter  Just when it looked like Poulter had qualified for Augusta during match play, he found out he was out and needed to win in Houston the following week. Lo and behold, the improbable happened and Poulter won his first PGA event in the US to secure his spot this week. He's been rock solid over the years at Augusta, making the cut in all eight starts over the last decade which includes six finishes in the top-25.
Poulter  ->  positive

Overall, Spieth has been as dominant at this course as any other in his career. Dustin Johnson ($10,300) – It was a very hard to choose between the long hitter in Dustin Johnson who can just overpower this course, or Jordan Spieth who always plays well here. So, I found a way to go with both!
Spieth  ->  positive

While he struggles with the flatstick, Grace is an adept approach player, placing 13th on Tour in strokes gained: approach last year. Middling  Ian Poulter: $7,900  Poults has never needed it more. Playing on a medical extension, he needs to essentially finish inside the top 30 to pocket enough money to keep his tour card.
Ian Poulter:  ->  positive

Considering his price on both sites, I will be considering him in all formats this week. Martin Laird  World Golf Ranking (#102)  Vegas Odds (75/1)  Draftkings ($7,600)  FanDuel ($9,100)  After back to back cuts at the CareerBuilder Challenge and Farmers Insurance Open, Party Marty has been trending up in a big way. He has posted back to back Top 10 finishes at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and Genesis Open.

Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens. Unlike Spieth, Casey has actually found some success off the tee – albeit not to the point where he’s a top-10 player, but he’s been consistent enough not to lose strokes in that area. The combination of that with his stellar approach, and Casey will be in position to sink birdie putts constantly this week.
Spieth,  ->  positive

He is a safe play in all formats. Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Others: Seung-Yul Noh, Francesco Molinari  High-upside GPP Picks  Matthew Fitzpatrick ($8,000): Maybe the most talented player in the field this week, which is really saying something given the depth. Fitzpatrick won the Euro Tour ending playoff event last year and now has three wins to his name over the last two years and a top five at Augusta. This track really lines up well for a player like him who relies more on precision than power.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

I have to play Stenson with odds of +1000. Daniel Berger - Daniel Berger has finished 16th or better in two of his last three events, which includes last week in Mexico. Berger has now made the cut in six of his last eight events and is 13th in birdie average.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

5th at the John Deere Classic the week before highlights that Stallings is on a roll and, as we saw in 2013, the Massachusetts-born 32 year-old can string a number of contending performances together when hot - indeed Scott was 7th in the Canadian Open hosted at Hamilton in 2012 the week after winning at Annandale. A win at Torrey Pines in 2014 translates well to previous winners here and Stallings has also performed well at classical tracks such as Colonial (4th 2013) and Muirfield Village (4th 2013) in the past. It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey.
Stallings  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley 80/1 (Skybet 7 places 1/5, SportingBet 5 places 1/4) 1pt e/w:  Much like Reavie, Bradley is a great statistical fit for the event, what’s more, he has course form to boot. In seven starts at Riviera, Bradley has as many top-4 finishes as he does missed cuts (2), and also has two other top-20 finishes to add to the collection. Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup.
Bradley  ->  positive

2016 Wyndham Championship top 10 picks  1. Patrick Reed -- Reed is a former winner here, doing that in 2013 for his first PGA Tour win. He had a good finish in Rio (final-round wise), and he's been a top-15 mainstay most of the summer.
Reed  ->  positive

He ranks #1 in my overall model which is helped by his stat rankings(to the field) that include a 4th in Strokes Gained: Approach and 6th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking(combination of 2016-17 and 2017-18 stats). All things considered, I will be using Woodland in all formats this week. Russell Knox  World Golf Ranking (#66)  Vegas Odds (55/1)  Draftkings ($8,500)  FanDuel ($6,800)  In terms of cash games, Knox is not on my radar this week as the form is just not there with a T63 and T72 to start the new season but for GPP's I think he makes an upside play at a course/event where he has had a ton of success in the past.
Woodland  ->  positive

--DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION--  ELITE  Rickie Fowler ($12,000) - He's just disgustingly good this year in virtually every phase of the game. Fowler is playing his superb T2G game with the confidence and poise of a soon-to-be major winner, and this event will provide him with a very nice warmup for Erin Hills next week. UPPER TIER  Phil Mickelson ($10,200) - There's always a little concern over the "week before major" narrative with guys who are already qualified, but now that we know Phil will not be playing it, this event just got that much better for him.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Rose won the 2015 renewal of the Zurich Classic and also finished 4th at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits that same year, so he has some good recent form at Pete Dye designs. In terms of Par 4 Performance, Rose ranks 8th on Tour, and also 17th in Par 4 Efficiency 450-500 yards, which is an important range for this course. At 30/1 you are getting the one of the best players in the world (currently #8 in the Official World Golf Rankings) and someone who is desperate to make up for that near miss at the Masters.
Rose  ->  positive

Stallings is ranked sixth on the Future of Fantasy's table of Poa Specialists so he's had stronger performances overall on these bumpier surfaces than other greens. A three-time PGA Tour winner, Stallings knows how to get it done and looks to be rounding into some nice form after a top 25 in Phoenix last week. He was excellent for three of the days (69, 65, 67) but was undone by a Saturday 74 after sitting fifth at halfway.
Stallings  ->  positive

In cash, I say eat the chalk, if he misses cut team can still easily cash but if he continues to do what he does and you avoid him you’re at a big disadvantage. Steele also is gaining strokes in just about every metric we look at in the VIP Spreadsheet which you can see free this week by signing up for a free 7 day trial with the code WIN  Danny Lee – All formats – DK:$8200 FD:$7800  After a not so great start to the season, Danny Lee has been on fire as of late. Traditionally Lee’s struggles as a player have come from his short game where he regularly loses strokes to the field around the green.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four.
Chappell's  ->  positive

So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Over the years I've really dedicated myself to amassing knowledge of the golf course, keeping notes and carrying those notes forward year on year." Rose's "love affair" with Augusta started in 2003 when he finished T39 and that's actually his worst finish! Since then, he's bagged three top fives and a further two top 10s, with five other top 25s.
Rose's  ->  positive

Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st. Pair that with the fact that he's the world's number-one ranked golfer, and he's a really tough fade.
Johnson  ->  positive

Westwood's a Masters ringer with five top-8 finishes (including a pair of runner-ups) in the last seven Masters. Kevin Kisner ($6,900)  The runner-up at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Kisner has been playing steady golf of late. He made the cut in his first Masters appearance last year and should play the weekend at the very least.
Kisner  ->  positive

He’s also 32nd in par-4 Birdie or Better percentage which is encouraging for this layout. Harris English ($7,000): English has been showing signs of life recently. His approach game has been improving of late and he was third in SG: Approach stats last week, after being first in this same stat a few weeks ago in Memphis.
Harris English  ->  positive

With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Also consider: Rickie Fowler, Emiliano Grillo, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka  Lower Priced Plays:  Here is a list of the lower priced players (below $8,000) we like this week on Draftkings that will be worth rostering:  Tony Finau ($7,900)  Byeong Hun-An ($6,900)  Patrick Cantlay ($7,800)  Peter Uihlein ($6,800)  Billy Horschel ($6,700)  Marc Leishman ($6,900)  Bill Haas ($6,900)  Brendan Steele ($6,700)  Kevin Tway ($6,500)  Other DraftKings Misprices:  This is something new we wanted to include in this weeks article as we believe there are several misprices that we can capitalize on to fit in some of the higher priced players.

Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix. Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights.
Taylor  ->  positive

Other: Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Francesco Molinari, Phil Mickelson, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Russell Henley, Russell Knox, Stewart Cink, Ricky Barnes  – Charl Schwartzel, Harold Varner III, Peter Uihlein, Sam Saunders, Chez Reavie, Danny Lee, Smylie Kaufman  Bets:  Kyle Stanley 40-1  Peter Uihlein 60-1 ew  Stewart Cink 70-1 ew  Harold Varner III 80-1 ew  Ricky Barnes 200-1 ew  Chez Reavie 160-1 ew  San Saunders 200-1 ew He should be able to bounce back here and is capable of taking advantage of a weaker field to post a top ten finish. Last week he gained strokes on the field in approaches over three rounds, but had a terrible back nine on Sunday.
Ricky Barnes  ->  positive

Last year saw the Predictor highlight Ryan Moore in 5th spot at 25/1, plus Ricky Barnes (4th spot) at 125/1 which I also tipped - he finished T5. So at a tournament where a specific and consistent set of challenges has to be met year-in, year-out, I'm going to stick with 3 selections from the top 5 of this week's Predictor Model and Brian Harman leads the way. Harman tops the predictor by a large margin and it's easy to see why.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Rafa Cabrera Bello e.w. @ 60/1  Rahm touched on the great match play records of Spaniards so, from the land of Seve and Ollie, I'll also have punt on Rafa Cabrera Bello. There's very simple course and current form logic to this punt but, despite his obvious credentials, the price is a good one at 60/1.
Cabrera Bello  ->  positive

Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign. A win at the CIMB and a 5th at the CJ Cup in his last two starts suggests Perez is ready for another strong season and after four events currently sits in 2nd place in the FedEx Cup standings. Given his obvious liking for this course, his most recent performances and what appears to be a new winning swagger, Perez looks a decent price at 33/1 and worth a bet this week.

Studs  *In order of my rankings  Jordan Spieth ($11,400)  Spieth sputtered a bit last week at the U.S. Open but came storming back Sunday with a 69 in difficult conditions. Surprisingly, Spieth’s ball-striking was solid, but it was his trusty putter that let him down at Erin Hills. That’s a good sign moving forward because we know he’ll regain his touch on the greens.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

After a solid performance in Sedgefield last week Sneds is certainly worth a second look here. Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Others to Consider  Jon Rahm ($9,700): Ranks third in driving distance, fourth in BoB%, sixth in T2G, and third in SG:OTT to the field over his last 24 rounds. Kevin Chappell ($7,000): Bomber who makes a lot of of birdies and always plays well at Quail Hollow. Great T2G player.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Madness to miss out on him at this price. Ryan Palmer 2 points each way at 40/1 with Sportnation.bet – Always pick Palmer in Texas, has had four top 10s here in his last three appearances in his home state. Can really attack the course and go on his famous birdie runs.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Indeed, he's no bigger for any of the four majors, yet here he does not have to beat the very best and nor does he have to prove that the course fits, because in six visits he's made five cuts, twice contending for the title, while even last year's 12th place included a third-round 65. Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson.
Fowler  ->  positive

I love Donald Ross' design. I think he's somewhat of a genius in terms of architecture and I've always enjoyed his golf courses, Donald confirmed. "The greens are very true, very fast, quite undulating.
Donald  ->  positive

Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign. A win at the CIMB and a 5th at the CJ Cup in his last two starts suggests Perez is ready for another strong season and after four events currently sits in 2nd place in the FedEx Cup standings.
Perez  ->  positive

If his putter gets hot, that and his elite ball-striking makes him a strong contender this week in Mexico. Sergio Garcia ($8,500) – Garcia had another solid week at the Honda Classic, but made too many mistakes to contend. He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking.
Garcia  ->  positive

All six players scrambled well or reasonably well and that's understandable.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

He is 20/1 because of the pure strength of the top of the market this week, but that’s big enough for me, considering his record here and wonderful current form. Hideki Matsuyama 40/1 (BetStars 5 places) 35/1 (Bet365 8 places, Boylesports and WilliamHill 7 places) 1pt e/w:  Hideki Matsuyama has been incredibly solid at Augusta over the last three years, finishing 5th, 7th and most recently 11th and he can go even better this week. After withdrawing from the Phoenix Open earlier this year with a wrist injury, Matsuyama made a return at Bay Hill, but could only finish T49.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending. In his last two starts, Rose has ranked 29th (Northern Trust) and 3rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Around-the-Green, so his play around the greens seems to coming round at the right time. Where he does still seem to be struggling is on the greens, ranking 61st (Northern Trust) and 23rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Putting.
Rose  ->  positive

His last three finishes at this event have been T17, T8 and T5 last year. Martin Laird ($7,400)  Laird is not a pick I would be trusting in cash games as he just hasn't been consistent here at Copperhead over the years. He has made four of six cuts but just one Top 10 back in 2011 before the course was updated.

Aaron Wise  It’s time to jump on the former NCAA individual champion’s bandwagon before it’s overflowing with bodies. After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside. A ball-striking and long-iron extraordinaire, Wise is better on approaches the further he is from the hole.
Wise  ->  positive

Other golfers who may go overlooked due to price this week with great records at TPC Boston include Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100) and Russell Henley ($7,600). From a price perspective, J.J. Spaun ($6,700), David Lingmerth ($6,700) and Chad Campbell ($6,700) all should be on the radar here as min-price tournament plays too. Recent Form  1.
David Lingmerth  ->  positive

That was better than all of last year's top-five bar Spieth. Taking advantage of the four easiest holes at Augusta is, as mentioned, really important and while par-five performance has long been something of an issue for Haas, there's evidence to suggest he's getting to grips with this particular set. Finally, for one at such a price and without a major in the bag, Haas does have a heck of a lot of top-level form including his 2011 FedEx Cup success, which came here in Georgia, and three Presidents Cup appearances which he's desperate to add to with a fourth at Liberty National later this year.
Haas,  ->  positive

Luiten’s form is peaking at the moment, much better than last year’s form before Mexico, and, like Sergio, he just needs to be average on the greens to post a springily lofty finishing position. Adam Hadwin  With many looking ahead to next week when he defends his title at Copperhead, the Canadian is riding sneaky form into Mexico City — T6/T43/T35/T3. He lacks the driving distance of the favorites, but his accuracy is so good that he won’t necessarily need to club down, which should close the distance gap without sacrificing the number of fairways he hits.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish. In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging. Last year Cauley shot his best round ever here with a 66 in the third round and also ranked number one in Par 5 Scoring for the week, which shows an increasing level of comfort with the venue.
Cauley  ->  positive

All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he’ll be in contention. Lucas Glover ($7200): Much like Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover is a player that is a huge step ahead of the field in terms of play from tee-to-green, but who struggles on the greens. Glover has always lacked a bit of distance off the tee (296.4 average), but over the years he’s consistently made up for it with a stellar second shot game (14th in SG: App) and with generally good accuracy off the tee (66.19%, 41st).
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

Hatton has a great record here finishing 13-46-10-6 in his last four appearances and looks in great form coming into this week. American Chez Reavie is also in fine fettle coming to California with five top 20’s in his last six starts. He started the season with a T13 at the Safeway Classic and followed that with a T17 at the CIMB Classic, T15 at the CJ Cup, T14 at OHL Classic and a T18 last week at the Sony.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

My model likes him a lot and his course history matches that. $6k – a few darts  Hudson Swafford ($6900) – Slightly under-priced and has good history, I like my chances with him. Bryson DeChambeau ($6900) – I think long-term he is a better player than this price and provides some decent upside down in this range.
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

Schniederjans played fantastic at this venue last season finishing T9 on his debut. Lower down, I’d also highlight Alex Noren ($7,800), Kevin Streelman ($7,500), Harris English ($7,400) and Bryson DeChambeau ($7,200) as some high-upside targets. Top Strokes Gained: Tee to Green from Last Week  1.
Harris English  ->  positive

The Ryder Cup star began the final lap just a shot back following a Saturday 66 but couldn't find the magic that had brought him three wins in five starts at the back end of 2017 and had to settle for T5. It was still a strong week though and speaking ahead of his closer, Rose noted: "First couple days there's sketchy stuff tee to green, like my first round. And probably the most important round I played so far, hung in there and stuck with it.
Rose  ->  positive

Horschel is one to follow when hot and Win/Win scenarios of late have become a fairly regular occurrence. RESULT: T34  Kyle Stanley 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Kyle Stanley is another I like this week. 27th here when playing as a web.com Tour player back in 2010 on course debut, he was 18th after 54 holes before a late Sunday pairing with K.J.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

7th (2013) and 1st at East Lake (2014) across an elite-class field also shows that Horschel likes the rigours of a Donald Ross test. Success here at Sedgefield had been limited with a 30th, 46th, 47th and a MC from 4 appearances until 12 months ago when Horschel off of the back of some indifferent non-Bermuda form, very reminiscent to what we are seeing from him at the moment, finished 5th. Naturally with a Floridian upbringing, this Bermudagrass narrative makes plenty of sense and in this season alone, Horschel has finished 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and 4th at TPC Southwind, with Bermudagrass making up 3 of his 4 top 5 finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

Like DJ, his record on Bentgrass greens is very good and he arrives at Eagle Point in fair form given he was beaten in a playoff in Phoenix in February and that he was tied 11th at the Heritage last time out. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [6.4]  Webb Simpson @ [44.0]  Carl Pettersson @ [260.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow morning with my Golf Sixes preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
DJ,  ->  positive

Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice. DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th.
DJ:  ->  positive

Casey finished 16th in the WGC Mexico Championship and he placed 11th in this year’s Honda Championship played at Fazio-designed PGA National. Casey is rarely going to make the most birdies in the field for a week, but what he will do is prevent disaster as he ranks 14th in bogey avoidance. He has a great tee-to-green game, ranking 16th on tour, and also ranks 21st in SG:App.
Casey  ->  positive

🚨 Fantasy Alert 🚨 Charles Howell III has withdrawn from the @WMPhoenixOpen. Get your #FantasyGolf picks in at… https://t.co/Z78TkxzOC5
Charles Howell III  ->  negative

His game sets up well again this week and should be a consideration for tournament contests. -- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons.
Kirk  ->  positive

He can make birdies with the best of them as he finished last season ranked 19th in BoB%. Like Walker and Mickelson, O'Hair really loves putting on these Poa greens. He ranks in the top 20 of our TFF projections and is one of the top players under $8,000.
Walker  ->  positive

Finding players who can play in poor conditions can be a huge difference maker in constructing winning lineups. Open Championship Picks  Sergio Garcia – All Formats – DK:$ 10600 FD: $9600  At the top of the price range, I am really liking Sergio for the week. Sergio has been on fire this year (2 wins, three top tens, 10/10 made cuts), has historically been great at the Open Championship and has the game that lines up to perform well here.
Sergio  ->  positive

No better place than where he picked up his first career PGA Tour win. Other Notable Stats Plays: Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Brendan Steele  Top Low-End Value Play  Byeong Hun An  World Golf Ranking (#56)  Vegas Odds (55/1)  Draftkings ($6,900)  FanDuel ($7,500)    This is the golfer who's price really stood out this week as being way too low. He played here for the first time last year, finishing T11 after missing his previous two cuts going into the tournament.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

He is my favourite pivot play this week. Harris English – $8,400  Harris English has been sneaky good lately, especially in his approach game. He ranks 1st in SG:APP and 3rd in DK points over his past 12 rounds in the field.
Harris English  ->  positive

How about: he's got two top-sixes and two more top-20s to start the year; he's made five straight cuts at Riviera; he's from Southern California and knows kikuyu; and he's fifth in scrambling, 13th in GIR and T26 in proximity. J.B. Holmes - $7,100 (40-1)    The oddsmakers don't consider DFS pricing before acting, but Holmes' price certainly doesn't jibe with his odds, and in a good way. He has had great success at Riviera, with six top-12s through the years, including T11 last year.
Holmes  ->  positive

If this does come to fruition we are looking at one tough week and I would imagine the winning score will be nowhere near as low as last year! PICKS  I have gone with 5 players this week as follows;  RUSSELL KNOX – 55-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  I mentioned above that one tried and tested formula for finding the right men to go with when the tour hits Florida is to look for the East Coast specialists who have performed beyond their normal expectations during the West Coast swing and Knox is one player this year who certainly fits that mould. Over recent years Russell has either not bothered with the West Coast or performed patchily at best, in fact the last year before this that he had a top 20 on the West Coast was 2015 and he went on to finish 3rd at the Honda Classic.
Russell  ->  positive

Can't get behind Na, either; he's missed the weekend his past three trips here, and his only performance of note (T-9) came in 2007. As for Spieth, Day and McIlroy: they definitely aren't my favorites. Spieth's flat stick continues to be an issue, and though River Highlands' greens will be a respite from the Open dance floors, he's not shown the type of putting consistency that instills conviction.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($9,600) – It feels weird going back to Stanley after a victory but then I ask myself who else are you going to take in this field? Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass. Stanley has a spot secured in the Open next weekend but my gut tells me this guy still grinds it out this week regardless to fine tune.
Stanley  ->  positive

Double major winner Spieth was T4 at Riviera in 2015 after T12 the year before and Matsuyama has course form of 11-4-23. But on this course where length is a definite advantage (Bubba Watson has won it in two of the last three years), I give Johnson the edge. Jason Day's chance looks less obvious given finishes of MC-MC-62 although they came from 2010-2012.
Johnson  ->  positive

Year Finish Position 2016 9 2015 39 2014 11 2013 30 2012 1  Another week, another Tony Finau ($8,700) recommendation. Finau has been playing extremely well this year. He is making cuts at close to the highest rate of his career and is slowly creeping up the OWGR.
Finau  ->  positive

Abraham Ancer 125/1 (Betfair/Paddypower and Boyleports 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Despite being raised in Mexico, Abraham Ancer was born in Texas and currently resides in San Antonio, and he will look to carry his trending form over as he plays at “home” for the second straight event. In his last three starts, Ancer has finished T16 (Valspar), T13 (Corales) and T8 (Houston) and should he keep this form up he may well contend for his second win as a professional and first on the PGA Tour. A winner already on the Web.com Tour in 2015, it is clear Ancer is an improving talent who will be looking to take advantage of a weakened field, building particularly on his last start.
Ancer  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin: Hadwin has only played here twice, but he hasn’t finished worse than 22nd in either appearance. Hadwin’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score is 10th, his 60.6 LT SC percentage is 19th, and his 14.4 LT Adj Bird Avg ranks ninth in the field. Pat Perez: With zero missed cuts and seven top-25 finishes in 2017, Perez comes into this event in fabulous form.
Adam Hadwin:  ->  positive

He also finished T9 at the Frankie Templeton Shootout, but as this is an unofficial event it seems silly to count it. Whilst Berger has hardly made a blistering start to the season, it has been steady enough and I am hoping he will build on that T7 finish last time out. On his debut at this event, Berger finished 2nd (lost in a play-off) to Padraig Harrington back in 2015.
Berger  ->  positive

At that point if anyone had told you that Lovemark would remain winless on the PGA tour more than 8yrs later you’d have said they were stark raving bonkers, however that is unfortunately the case. The main reason for this of course is that Lovemark’s career was derailed by a major back problem in 2010, which ultimately required surgery in 2011. After time off for the necessary rehab Jamie a historical fader of the ball had developed a hook in his game, which coupled with the pressure he was under to fulfil a Major Medical Exemption lead to real struggles on the course.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state. Piller has been wildly inconsistent on the PGA Tour, despite being a six-time winner on the Web.com Tour, one of which came last year to help secure his PGA Tour card this season. Whilst he hasn’t yet been able to make the step up and win on the main Tour, he has finished inside the top-5 on multiple occasions, including here when finishing T4 in 2016.
Piller  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy should probably join him in the top 10 (or five) but Stenson's been there and done it on this course whereas Rory hasn't. I'm tempted to support Justin Rose but will take Paul Casey at the bigger top 10 price of [4.70]. The Englishman has latest Florida form of 11-23-9-7 (the 9th coming in this event) and he putts well on Bermuda greens.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($10,200): I feel like I am beating the drum week after week here with Casey but he really has been excellent over his past few starts. Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings. Given the potentially high winds I do think this is a field in which you can potentially fade the top three options and still field a winning gpp roster and Casey might be the man to target if you are going after that strategy.
Casey  ->  positive

Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early. Whilst question marks still remain as to whether Kokrak is a winner at this level, he has had plenty of near misses and will probably get over the line eventually. What is not in doubt is his ability to go low on any given round, especially on a Thursday, and that’s all we need from him.
Kokrak  ->  positive

Here are my selections for the 2017 Sony Open. Pat Perez 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w  Pat Perez at 40/1 is one of those picks I struggle to make, but also find terribly difficult to ignore. Perez returned to action last October at the CIMB Classic and finished T33.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

He started with an opening round 64 and followed that with 67,65,71 to post 13 under. Stanley has a good record in Torrey over the last few years and came close to victory in 2012.He had a healthy three shot lead on the 18th tee and ended up taking a disappointing triple bogey after finding water short of the 18th green and went on to lose a playoff to Brandt Snedeker. Despite that collapse, Stanley seems to like this course finishing T25 in 2016 and T14 last year and looks great value to have a good week here.
Stanley  ->  positive

European Tour's Race to Dubai returns this week on Page 3. Golf Channel (PlayFantasyGolf.com)      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”    Last Week Points: 223  Last Week Rank: 8,402      Dustin Johnson ($33,300)  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Abraham Ancer ($1,100)  Dean Burmester ($2,300)  Patrick Cantlay ($14,400)  Phil Mickelson ($14,600)    Analysis: Going with a Stars and Scrubs approach this week with DJ and Spieth leading the way. Ancer should be comfortable with the culture and language spoke on the property this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Marc Leishman was giving both Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth all they could handle at TPC Boston last Monday, but ultimately - with a 2-shot lead on the 10th tee - the pressure got to him. However from adversity we've seen players blossom and Leishman, who sits 7th in the FedEx Cup standings, has the kind of result CV that links beautifully to previous winners here Zach Johnson and Jason Day. 5th at Waialae in 2014 (Johnson was winner there in 2009), 2nd at Torrey Pines in both 2010 and 2014 (Day was a winner there in 2015), 1st at Bay Hill this year (Day won there in 2016), 4th at Augusta in 2013 (Johnson won there in 2007, Day 2nd in 2011), 3rd at TPC Four Seasons in both 2012 and 2014 (Day won there in 2010), 2nd at St Andrews in 2015 (Johnson won the title, with Day 4th a single shot out of the Playoff), plus 3rd at Firestone in 2014 (Johnson was 2nd there this year), highlight that Leishman can circulate in very high echelons when he plays his very best golf.
Leishman  ->  positive

Finally Huh has some eye catching progressively improving form at Copperhead with finishes of 33rd, 22nd and then 9th over the past three years, which gives further cause for optimism of a good week ahead. DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 31st  The mention of Bozzelli above leads me on nicely to my last selection of the week. Regular readers will know that I was on Bozzelli a couple of weeks ago at the Honda at the massive odds of 350-1.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

10th (2014) and 4th (2017) at Sea Island and 3rd at PGA West (2017) also marry-up perfectly from a comfortable on TifDwarf Bermudagrass greens perspective. Cameron Smith 1pt EW 40/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Regular readers will know I'm a fan of Cameron Smith and golf betting is often a game of patience. Scrolling down to the bottom of the Sentry leaderboard early last Friday morning and seeing young Mr Smith ensconced in tied 30th spot alongside Jordan Spieth was not something I anticipated.
Smith  ->  positive

He rode a hot putter to a T8 in last weekends Sanderson Farms Championship and if he ride that momentum he could grab another Top 10 this week. Also Consider - Jamie Lovemark  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Jason Bohn  World Golf Ranking (165)  Vegas Odds (101/1)  Draftkings ($6,200)  FantasyAces ($4,500)    If you are looking for GPP value, Jason Bohn is it this week. He comes back to TPC Summerlin with outstanding course history, making all seven cuts and finishing T2, T18, T2, T8 his last four trips to Las Vegas.
Jason Bohn  ->  positive

Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well. Other to Consider: Rickie Fowler (Cash)  Mid-Tier Targets:  David Lingmerth (DK: $8,500, FD: $7,200)    Lingmerth won the Web.com event when it was played at TPC Potomac a few years ago, and he is playing some great golf at the moment.
Haas  ->  positive

Australians have a nice record at this event and Adam Scott (a former winner) could go overlooked due to his lack of play. Lower down some speculative plays include Bud Cauley ($7,400), Kyle Stanley ($7,400), Roberto Castro ($6,400) and Martin Flores ($6,700-see write-up below). Recent Form  Top Recent Form (Overall):  1.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

With that being said, let’s go right into this week’s picks. KEY STATS FOR DFS PGA THIS WEEK:  Strokes Gained T-G Strokes Gained Putting GIR Par 4 Scoring Birdie or Better Drive Distance Scrambling  DraftKings PGA Picks of the Week  Henrik Stenson ($11700)  Stenson is an interesting name for me this week as he’s a guy I believe can shine, but he did have his struggles at Bethpage the last time The Barclays rolled through there. He’s been as good as anyone all year over his last seven events with T4, WIN, T13, WIN, T7, 2nd place finishes, and a WD mixed in which he actually was doing quite well prior to withdrawing.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

A guy with another good combination of LT Adj Rd and LT DD is J.B. Holmes, who has finished 68th, 12th, and 52nd over his last three tournaments; he’s a volatile player perfect for guaranteed prize pools (GPPs). Holmes has a massive 315.4-yard LT DD, and his 13.7 Long-Term Birdies Per Tournament is the fourth-best mark in the field. He has respectable odds to win the tournament at 2.4 percent, which isn’t bad for his $8,500 price tag on DraftKings.
J.B. Holmes,  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Piller  ->  positive

Perhaps more importantly, he’s been longer off the tee of late, averaging a Recent DD of 305.2 yards. Cink doesn’t have any history at this course, but he allows you to take a stars-and-scrubs lineup approach. A guy with another good combination of LT Adj Rd and LT DD is J.B. Holmes, who has finished 68th, 12th, and 52nd over his last three tournaments; he’s a volatile player perfect for guaranteed prize pools (GPPs).
Cink  ->  positive

Harman should find himself in the middle of the pack this week and these odds are too great to pass up. Also, Harman shot a 61 in the second round of the 2012 Honda Classic, which is a course record, so he does have some history on this course and a great feel for things. Harman has produced four of those top-25 finishes in his last five events overall.
Harman  ->  positive

In-form Chez Reavie and Tommy Fleetwood, who should take to the track, were both on the radar but I felt they were both fractionally short so my four are Kevin Streelman, Charl Schwartzel, William McGirt and KJ Choi. Streelman currently ranks third for GIR and second for Scrambling on the PGA Tour so he emphatically ticks the correct stats boxes. McGirt is also a great statistical fit with decent recent form and very solid course form (sixth, 14th and 20th last three visits) and KJ Choi could get in the mix again at a venue he loves, given he was on the fringes of contention last week.
Kevin Streelman,  ->  positive

Could Phil parlay a 3 week stretch ending with another green jacket? Russell Henley ($8,700) Three top 10’s here and coming off 3 straight made cuts with a top 10 at Valspar. Everything seems to be pointing to a 4 th straight top ten at the SHO.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week. Safely qualified for the Ryder Cup team (as Kuchar was when winning this in 2010), Walker's results CV looks very similar to that of Nick Watney with a plethora of top finishes on the West Coast across Torrey Pines, Pebble Beach, CordeValle and Riviera, so we know he can perform well on putting surfaces with Poa Annua in them. That fact is backed up by his win at Baltusrol which ticks the won 'Up-State' box.
Walker  ->  positive

Well, he has posted nine Top-10 finishes in his past 10 starts, including a win at thein China, and consecutive Top 5s in his last two turns at the Valspar Championship and Arnold Palmer Invitational. Unlike Phil, who’s using this as a tune-up event, Rose showed last year that he’s game to compete, churning out againing the third-most strokes with his irons, before inevitably dropping the Masters playoff tothe following week. It’s somewhat concerning that Rose has used a hot putter to propel himself to those lofty finishes in the past two events (at least 6.7+ SG: PUTT in each), but he’s one of the premier long-iron players in the field, tops in Birdies or Better Gained over the past 50 rounds and third in Par 5s Gained in that same stretch.
Rose  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Matt Kuchar ($9,400) – Steady Kuchar looked like a potential cut risk on Thursday/Friday last week, but in typical Kuchar fashion, he rallied back for a nice and easy T12 finish. There is nobody in this field with a better overall track record at this course, and when it comes to smooth, steady T2G play, Kuchar is among the best ever. Lock him in.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Selections  Jon Rahm @ [12.5]  J.B. Holmes @ [48.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter He's always been a very streaky type but well capable of winning when in form, so last week's return to contention at Torrey Pines could be significant. J.B. Holmes is a twice former winner of this title and has a couple of further top-six finishes among his record.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

Finally, whilst, as I’ve also noted above, past course form is not a requisite here it naturally doesn’t do any harm to have some and as a previous winner of the event Kevin is bound to have really positive vibes returning to the Copperhead track and I can see him going really close again this week. LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th.
LUCAS GLOVER  ->  positive

I like DJ just fine but I’ll save and spend elsewhere for this LU. The next tier gives you some great options like JB (Don’t call me John) Holmes, Reed, Castro, and Blixt. After the MC in Phoenix I’ll take Castro to bounce back and hope some are scared off Roberto.
Reed,  ->  positive

Also Consider: Ollie Schniderjans, Russell Henley, Tommy Fleetwood, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Webb Simpson, Beyong–Hun An, Charles Howell (14/16 here, and has now made ten straight cuts, great value at only $6,900), Anirban Lahiri, and Billy Horschel. Regardless of what his ownership level ends up being (13-16% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs), Kaymer is an absolute steal at $7,400, and is a strong play in both cash games and GPPs. He has only played here at Bayhill once, missing the cut back 2008, but this was a long time ago, and Kaymer is a world class player who is in great current form.
Anirban Lahiri,  ->  positive

He missed the cut in Malaysia last week and was said to be carrying some sort of injury so he's a risky proposition but I couldn't let him go un-backed at that price. Selection:  Charl Schwartzel @ [90.0]    I'll be back on Friday after the first round with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

Lowry hasn't set the world alight on the PGA Tour this year, with a missed cut at Torrey Pines and a 65th placed-finish in the Phoenix Open on Sunday, but he's a great links exponent and poa annua putter and he was in-form before Christmas. His tournament form figures read 21-41-14 and I thought he was just worth chancing at [95.0]    Selections:  Chez Reavie @ [75.0]  Shane Lowry @ [95.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with my ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

At third in strokes-gained off-the-tee so far this season, Molinari junior is exuding control from the tee as usual and that formula is a good one here. Molinari's form figures don't look altogether inspiring, but I don't believe he's played in a truly suitable event so far this season. There are no excuses on that score now returned to Florida, where he's also built up a fine record in the not dissimilar PLAYERS Championship as well as here at Bay Hill.
Molinari  ->  positive

While Blair hasn’t finished higher than 40th in his last six events, he does have 12th- and eighth-place finishes on his resume this season. Sha Na Na  Unlike Blair, Kevin Na is in good form, tied for 19th in the field with his 69.2 Rec Adj Rd Score. Na’s Rec GIR percentage (66.7) and Rec DA percentage (69.7) rank within the top 10, and his 14.5 Rec Adj Bird Avg is 14th overall.
Blair  ->  positive

He could threaten a place putting badly and it's in the hope that a few weeks off have helped him find something that the Kentucky native gets the vote. Of the many tempting options at three-figure prices, it's Andrew Landry who stands out. Born in Texas, Landry won a couple of minor tour events in his home state before turning professional and hinting that difficult conditions may bring out his best when scoring a five-shot victory in 11-under-par on the Web.com Tour.
Landry  ->  positive

Final selections –  Jordan Spieth 13/2 1pt EW  Rickie Fowler 16/1 0.5pts EW  Russell Henley 33/1 0.5pts EW  Billy Horchel 45/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6 Pressure could be a big motivator for Horchel here so he could be worth chancing. Statswise he ranks fourth in GIR, 35th in SGTTG, 34th in SG approaches to the green and 26th in par 4 scoring.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Bradley was first for greens in regulation at the Travelers so his irons were dialled in while he was third on the All-Around so did everything well. If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there.
Bradley's  ->  positive

2. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  negative

We're relying on Mickelson having given an honest assessment but he's been good for that in the past and, at the price and in an event where most have some kind of question to answer, he's worth a decent each-way bet. Those who read every word of my 2018 Money List preview may have noticed that I put forward this event as a decent opportunity for Aaron Wise and Beau Hossler, and nothing has changed my mind on that since. Justin Thomas threatened to win it straight off the Web.com Tour and the three courses used are set up straightforwardly, much like most of the events on the feeder circuit.
Aaron Wise  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Rory Sabbatini ($7,200)  There’s a distinct lack of quality at the very bottom end of this field, but there are still some plays worth talking about a little higher up. One of those is definitely Rory Sabbatini. After a poor start to this season, Sabbatini has ramped things up lately, with five straight made cuts; four of which were top-25 finishes.
Sabbatini  ->  positive

Hossler is currently trading at 200+ whilst Jaeger is at 250+ Unfortunately the exchange market is fairly weak in this event at the moment so neither players exchange price are quite where I'd hoped for at this stage, but both are still worth supporting..Hossler has also been strongly tipped elsewhere. With Jaegar again it was a case of his ability to go low should suit this event and I was also mindful that one of his wins on the Web.com last year came in a pro am event.
supporting..Hossler  ->  positive

Coming off a great U.S. Open, Steele ranks 6th in Par 4 Scoring, 14th in BoB%, and 19th in SG:T2G. Paul Casey ($9,700) – Our final cash game staple, Casey has been playing solid golf this year. If only he could’ve avoided the fescue on the weekend at Erin Hills.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Simply put, the winner will likely be an experienced player with elite ball-striking who rolls in a few more putts than normal due to the easy conditions and putting surfaces. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12,800 – Spieth finished third at Waialae last year after a three-year hiatus from the event, so expect high caliber play from the superstar youngster. Spieth should have no problem making oodles of birdies if he can hit it reasonably off the tee box.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Russell Henley has played outstanding golf almost all season, with an early season equipment change doing wonders for his approach game specifically. Henley has always been good off the tee and on the greens, but his new found efficiency is pushing him towards the top of the tour in many other stats as well. He ranks 13th in Par 4 Scoring overall and is seventh on tour in efficiency on par 4s from 450-500 yards (and 10th from 400-450 yards).
Russell Henley  ->  positive

I know he's not been at his best of late but this place really suits him and I was delighted to get a triple-figure price. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [6.4] (saver)  Kevin Streelman @ [100.0]  Charl Schwartzel @ [120.0]  William McGirt @ [180.0]  K.J Choi @ [410.0]  I'll be back later with my Oman Open preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
William McGirt  ->  positive

Piercy ranks eighth in SG off the tee, ninth in SGTTG and tenth in SG Approaches to the green. With a great record here and good current form Piercy could be another player to keep an eye on here. Harold Varner 80/1  I was quite surprised to see Harlod Varner at such a big price considering he’s in great form coming to Hawaii this week.
Piercy  ->  positive

Later in the week, I will update SlackChat with how my ownership will end up in GPP’s. Paul Casey – GPP – DK:$9400 FD: $11600  Definitely check back into our SlackChat as this thought could change but I think looking at pricing Paul Casey could come in very under-owned and give you a top-end talent playing well with low ownership. Casey’s price makes him tough to roster if going for any of the top end guys and I think it is much easier when constructing rosters to spend less on Cantlay, Kucher or Perez.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016. At 66th in the PGA Tour Driving Distance stats, Phil has taken an average of 6 yards off of his driving to hit more fairways in a bid to hit far more greens.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Maybe that’s because he’s in his comfort zone so he can miss a putt every now and again and it doesn’t define whether he wins or loses, so because he can, he probably misses less of them. Harrington on Jordan Spieth:  Jordan clearly has the X-factor. He plays golf pretty much like everybody else but he has that something special and he brings it to Augusta.
Jordan  ->  negative

He has made three of four cuts with top-10 and top-20 finishes. Mullinax leads the field with his robust 71.5 percent Recent Greens in Regulation percentage, and he is second with his 322.8-yard Recent DD. Importantly, Mullinax’s 13.4 LT Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament ranks eighth.
Mullinax  ->  positive

A second-round 76 cost Berger a real chance of finishing inside the top-5 at Birkdale, ultimately having to settle for a modest T27. A solid four rounds at Firestone followed, which led to a T17 finish there but a real low round was absent from Berger’s four scorecards last week. Berger has two starts at the Wells Fargo Championship, finishing 28th on debut in 2015 before improving in 2016 with a 17th, so there is an expectation for him to improve again on his third start at Quail Hollow, even with the changes to the course taken into account.
Berger  ->  positive

He's been a bit disappointing since he successfully defended in Phoenix in February with a missed cut at the Genesis Open and a 25th placed finish in Mexico but I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised to see him bounce back here. Selections    I've played both Henrik Stenson and Hideki Matsuyama towards the head of the market and I've alo backed Zach Johnson and Morgan Hoffman. This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won.
Morgan  ->  positive

Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events. Paul Casey ($10,200) – People looking at Casey’s recent history here (43rd, MC) will be turned off, but he’s posted 13th and 5th place finishes previously at Colonial. When we’re targeting accurate ball-strikers, Casey pops to the top of our list.
Casey  ->  positive

He's one of the nicest characters in the world of sport, let alone golf, and he has a fabulous chance but it's all there to be seen and his price is bang on. Selections  I backed Jordan Spieth last week at [17.0] and I'm more than happy to have him onside. I'm a big fan of course form at this event and after a decent week in Houston he looks nicely primed to perform well here again.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

All the time Kirk is three-figures he is worth keeping an eye on in current form, and given his play here in 2013 I thought this could be another chance for him to finish inside the top-5. Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts.
Taylor  ->  positive

With five straight top-8 finishes which include four top-5’s, it is now time for Harman to capitalise on some special form. Harman has made huge strides as a player over the last couple of years and whilst his win at the Wells Fargo was just his second on the PGA Tour, and his first for three years, he now looks ready to become a perennial winner on Tour. The potential has been there ever since Harman was an amateur winning multiple times, as well as playing on winning Palmer and Walker Cup teams.
Harman  ->  positive

Harold Varner III 70/1 - T34 at Bay Hill, T11 thru 54 holes. 4th in the field in SG Approach. Beat a better field in Australia in December.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

His form is the best on TOUR at the moment, and he now travels to Kuala Lumpur CC, where he’s won the previous two years. Thomas ranks first in our Cheat Sheet, converting birdies at the highest rate, 2nd best in Par 4 Scoring, and 6th in T-G. He ranks no lower than 47th in any stat we’ve looked at this week and while he’s the most expensive on DraftKings by a pretty large margin, he’s the favorite to win this week, so you’ll want him in your lineups.
Thomas  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  MY PICK : Louis Oosthuzien ($9,100)  Oosthuizen started the playoffs strong last week with a T10. While he was somewhat wild off the tee at Glen Oaks, Oosthuizen’s approach game was on point as he gained over 4.2 strokes on the field in approaches and was T3 for the week in Greens in Regulation. The South African has come close to winning multiple times this year in strong field events, and the venue this week clearly speaks to him as he’s landed finishes of T12-T8-T2 at TPC Boston over his last three appearances – a record which includes six of his last 12 rounds being 67 or better.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

BEAU HOSSLER – 150-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 2nd  For my final selection this week I am going to roll the dice again with a player who we were on earlier in the year in the form of Beau Hossler. Regular readers of my work will know that I picked Hossler as one of my players to follow for 2018 and on the West Coast swing he was certainly living up to the bill. As a native Californian it’s not surprising that Beau cooled off a bit once the tour reached Florida however I am hoping that a trip to his adopted home state of Texas will reignite things.
BEAU HOSSLER  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour. Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

Cink has missed two cuts in a row and is 44, and Glover has poor history at PGA National, but they’re definitely underpriced relative to their talent. Two other guys who stand out in the $7,000 range are Charles Howell and Russell Henley. Howell is the perfect cash-game play: Of golfers with at least 25 tournaments over the past year, he ranks third with an 83 percent Consistency Rating.
Russell Henley.  ->  positive

We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic. These unknown greens in Mexico will result in tough 5 – 7 footers and patience will help.
Hatton  ->  negative

Here are my picks for the 2017 U.S. Open. Jordan Spieth 16/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds. WilliamHill 6 places 1/5 odds) 2pts e/w:  Jordan Spieth has not had his best season so far, but the fact we are saying that is a testament to the lofty expectations placed on him by both us and himself.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He’s 7th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, over the past 24 rounds. Jon Rahm ($10,800) has scored the most DK Points over his past 24 rounds. He’s 1st in Strokes Gained: Total and 2nd in Strokes Gained: Approach in that time frame.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

When he catches some form, there’s a good chance he will keep it going for a while, so a good week here will certainly bode well ahead of the Masters in three weeks’ time. Fitzpatrick is first out on the 10th tee on Thursday, playing with Brandon Harkins and former winner of this event, Robert Gamez so he will get the best of the greens, making him an intriguing option as First Round Leader, an honour he shared with Emiliano Grillo last season. Tom Jacobs – Sam Horsfield to finish inside the top-20 (8/1)  Still just 21, it feels like Sam Horsfield’s name has been bounded around forever but that is because Ian Poulter has been gushing about the young Englishman’s ability for years.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

The FedEx Cup itself has been won by the Tour Championship tournament winner here every time since 2010. Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Billy Horschel, Henrik Stenson and Brandt Snedeker were all in the top 6 of the FEC standings across the last 5 renewals whilst Bill Haas and Jim Furyk were in positions 25 and 11 respectively in the 2 years prior to that. 12 months ago, Rory McIlroy was he first FEC winner since Bill Haas to not control his own destiny when arriving in Atlanta.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Winning machine Thomas hit the ball beautifully at Augusta last time, was 12th here in 2015, and also finished fifth on the Web.com Tour on his only other start in Louisiana. You can rest assured both these Alabama graduates will have plenty of support from the Crimson Tide and it’s also of some significance that they play a similar ball – Cauley the Pro V1, Thomas the Pro V1 X – although they’re hardly unique on that front. Even so, Thomas currently leads the PGA Tour in birdie average and alongside an in-form partner looks overpriced in what should develop into a real shootout.
Cauley  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen 60/1 (BetBright 1-6 1/4 odds) 1pt e/w:  Louis Oosthuizen has always been considered a major player, and already has an Open Championship on his CV, which he almost added to, two years ago. Oosthuizen won the 2010 Open Championship at St.Andrews by 7 strokes and five years later, nearly won it again at the very same course. Oosthuizen made it into the three-man play-off at the 2015 Open, but was beaten by Zach Johnson.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

He also ranks inside the Top 10 in SG: Putting this season and if he can avoid the double bogey's that cost him the win last week, he has a great shot at winning a Green Jacket. Hideki Matsuyama  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,900)  FanDuel ($9,700)  If you are looking to go ultra-contrarian in the top tier this week just roster Jason Day. He should be extremely low owned but comes with a lot of risk as we just don't know where his head is at.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

His play at the Match Play had a disappointing result (T52), but he rates out very well for Augusta:  2 nd in SG: Off the Tee (1.036)  in SG: Off the Tee (1.036) 2 nd in Driving Distance (All Drives), 312.0 yards  in Driving Distance (All Drives), 312.0 yards 13 th in Putts per Round – although he’s three-putted 17 times (3.37%)  in Putts per Round – although he’s three-putted 17 times (3.37%) 2 nd in overall Birdie or Better percentage, 28.17%  in overall Birdie or Better percentage, 28.17% T4 in Par-4 Scoring, T34 in Par-5 Scoring  Much like Bubba, Rahm’s a long hitter that tends to be inaccurate with the driver, and for a golfer that’s seemingly got horrific SG: Approach numbers (137th on Tour, losing 0.161 strokes), Rahm is still hitting 69.05% of greens in regulation. Over his last 24 measured rounds, Rahm is the 16th-best putter in the field on bentgrass, compared to 31st on Bermuda, which is another notch in his belt for the speedy greens of Augusta National. Other golfers to consider: Justin Rose ($9300) – chalk, chalk, chalk; Dustin Johnson ($11400) – poor year by his standards but expected low-ownership for the current number one is hard to pass up.
Rahm’s  ->  positive

While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish. In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging. Last year Cauley shot his best round ever here with a 66 in the third round and also ranked number one in Par 5 Scoring for the week, which shows an increasing level of comfort with the venue.
Cauley  ->  positive

He's 19th for Birdie Average. Last four events: 7-MC-4-9  Course form: 36-13-8-MC-63-MC-30-17-14-22  Florida form: MC-36-WD-MC-13-53-17-48-8-58-46-8  Last 50 starts - Win: 4%, Top 5: 16%, Top 10: 30%    Paul Casey  "It's a golf course I love," said Casey when speaking about Bay Hill last year. "I've not necessarily had great results here in the past but I think that the conditions suit my game.
Casey  ->  positive

But other than Dustin Johnson four years ago, the champions have been of standard length -- or in the case of Zach Johnson in 2014 and Steve Stricker in 2012, even sub-standard. Last year, Jordan Spieth rolled to an eight-stroke victory over Patrick Reed despite being only T17 in driving distance. He won by masterfully playing the angles of the course, not to mention leading the field in strokes gained putting and finishing third in both scrambling and proximity to the hole (the greens are enormous, and simply doing well at GIR won't cut it).
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

In the stats of importance this week, Steele ranks 20th in Greens in Regulation, T22 in Par-4 Performance and T34 in Par-4 Scoring Average this season. In addition, Steele ranks 15th in the All-Around Ranking. Steele has only won twice on the PGA Tour, his first win coming back in 2011, so it may be difficult to see him winning twice in one season when it took him six years just to add to his maiden victory.
Steele  ->  positive

No wonder therefore that experienced players, with a liking for tight par 70s, tend to thrive here. Short game specialists (Jordan Spieth, Chris Kirk and Zach Johnson) and ball-strikers (Adam Scott and Boo Weekley) have an equal chance of victory on this classical Colonial layout. Jordan Spieth and Chris Kirk scrambled and putted their way to victory; prior to that Adam Scott (2014) and Boo Weekley (2013) had diligently plotted their way around the par 70, both ranking in the top-10 for Driving Accuracy and Greens in Regulation.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage. I prefer Haas over Webb this week due to a few stats.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Sure, players will have one more opportunity to fine tune their games next week at the St. Jude Classic, but you’re not getting the same quality of field. I guarantee the galleries in Memphis won’t be seeing six of the world’s Top 10 – Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, and Adam Scott – or another hefty dose of the Top 25: Justin Rose (Rose has decided to skip the event), Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar, Charl Schwartzel, Brooks Koepka, Kevin Kisner, and Phil Mickelson. If St. Jude can draw a fourth of those names, I shall be stunned.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Perhaps the hangover ends this week. Paul Casey - $10,200    Casey does not have the greatest recent form here -- T43 two years ago, missed cut the year before -- but this is a course that should suit him, and he's certainly more on his game than he was in 2014-15. Like Garcia he's a sub-optimal putter, but Casey ranks seventh in both ball striking and P4P, 12th in SGT2G and T25 in proximity.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

He’s been consistently good since missing the cut at the PGA Championship in August. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Turning it around a bit to start the new season, but he struggled enough toward the end of last year that we can’t justify the $9,800 price tag here.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  negative

I personally will be splitting them in my GPP lineups but if you are looking to go contrarian you will get Rory McIlroy and Alex Noren at a big ownership discount this week. I would lean McIlroy who has been a good wind player over the years and also has a bit of course history as he finished 2nd here back in 2014. He also bounced back from a missed cut at Pebble Beach with a T20 at the Genesis so you could say he is trending in the right direction.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

$8million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive: Jamie Lovemark has to be positive this week at $9.6 million. A lover of soft, scorable golf courses, he was 6th here last term - going out in the final group with Dufner and Hadwin. Lovemark seems the sort, who struggles to get over the line, but undoubtedly he strings form together well and he's 15th for Total Birdies season to date, after hitting another 2 eagles and 18 birdies at Waialae.

He is probably too risky for cash games but is an excellent, high upside GPP play. Who the Stat Like  Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#74)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,100)  I already talked about Hadwin and Steel who rank #1 and #3 in my overall model so we will jump right to the guy in the middle of them, Tony Finau. Looking at the field ranks for this week, Finau is 1st in SG: OTT, 2nd in SG: OTT + APP, 5th in Driving Distance, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd and 14th in GIR from 175-200 and 200+ and 15th in both Bogey Avoidance and Birdie or Better %.
Finau  ->  positive

He comes to the fore on mid-score (-11 to -17) level tournaments and at 7th in the Team USA Ryder Cup standings, a win this week would pretty much lock his place on the flight to Paris in September - which on form over the last 10 months you have to say he merits.

Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The reason I struggle to pick him is the price. Pat Perez has won twice on the PGA Tour in 380 starts. This isn’t an impressive ratio, and given it was seven years between his two victories, Perez seems difficult to rely on.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

-- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic. -- Joe Kaiser  DraftKings value picks  Kelly Kraft  I may be a week late on Kraft as he jumped up the leaderboard last week, but I'm thinking that the putting could still get better than it was last week (where he was putrid on the greens).
Campbell  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

It's also worth remembering that this is only the third time that the Texas Open has been played 2 weeks after The Masters. Looking at the past 7 winners in this post-Augusta slot, Bohn (80/1), Horschel (33/1), Noh (125/1) and Rose (11/1) won at TPC Louisiana; Snedeker (35/1) at Harbour Town and Ben Curtis (150/1), Charley Hoffman (30/1) and Kevin Chappell (33/1) here at TPC San Antonio. As you'd expect a mix of players and circumstances across 3 different courses, but all had at least a top 16 finish in one of their previous 2 outings which differs significantly from the incoming form characteristics if you look purely at the Valero Open winners.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Paul Casey – GPP – DK:$9400 FD: $11600  Definitely check back into our SlackChat as this thought could change but I think looking at pricing Paul Casey could come in very under-owned and give you a top-end talent playing well with low ownership. Casey’s price makes him tough to roster if going for any of the top end guys and I think it is much easier when constructing rosters to spend less on Cantlay, Kucher or Perez. Casey is still playing good golf as he showed with his T9 finish a few weeks ago at Abu Dhabi and although he has no course history he has shown over the years his ability to adapt to new courses.
Casey  ->  positive

He's played just twice since November but finished 9th in Abu Dhabi in mid-January and 8th last week at Pebble Beach. Casey is a stellar tee-to-green player and can get the irons going as well as pretty much anyone. Phil Mickelson ($11,300 | 22) - Mickelson is a two-time winner here (2008 and 2009) and has a pair of seconds in 2007 and 2012.
Casey  ->  positive

I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.
Bubba  ->  negative

Koepka is 20th in strokes gained: off the tee in this field and is 8th in strokes gained: approach at this course (among 50 golfers with course history in the past five years) in his four rounds. Rickie Fowler ($9,000 | 18/1) - Rickie always has big ownership, but it's justified because he either fits the course well or is playing well or has played at that particular course well. Fowler has finished top-10 (10th, 10th, 8th) in the past three years at this event and was 2nd back in 2011.
Rickie  ->  positive

Paul Casey - $10,200    Casey does not have the greatest recent form here -- T43 two years ago, missed cut the year before -- but this is a course that should suit him, and he's certainly more on his game than he was in 2014-15. Like Garcia he's a sub-optimal putter, but Casey ranks seventh in both ball striking and P4P, 12th in SGT2G and T25 in proximity. Matt Kuchar - $10,100    The ultimate safety-net pick.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s a riskier play as he enters the week in terrible form, but as Si Woo Kim and Billy Horschel have shown recently, form is not the be all and end all. On the year, Reavie’s had some fantastic finishes including a T8 in the strong Sony Open field, but no Top-25s since January will help keep him slide under the radar. Reavie is another shorter hitter that’s deadly accurate (11th in Accuracy %) which has led him to a great Par-4 Scoring rank of 32nd (4.01) – he’s also great on Par-3s at 18th (3.00) but will struggle on the par-5s because of that lack of distance.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

This contest has a large number of entries, with guaranteed prize payouts, which means we can't play it safe if we want to see our name at the top! DraftKings Picks:    Rory McIlroy ($11,100): He's still one of the best at racking up birdies (and eagles) in bunches when he's on his game. I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

He has above-average putting numbers across the board, performs better on par-3s and -4s (he struggles on par-5s due to the distance), but has also never made the cut here and will be a high-risk/high-reward play thanks to expected low ownership. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card.
Wagner  ->  positive

Spieth will be playing this course for the first time which is a scary proposition at his price point, which could help keep ownership slightly lower than it should be. The concerns with Spieth have typically come in just one area, Off the Tee, but he’s an absolute stud in every other facet of golf – he leads the Tour in SG: Approach, is 40th in SG: Putting (but 3rd in Putting Average), and 40th in SG: Around the Green. The Off the Tee numbers aren’t nearly as terrifying as they would be otherwise, because his lack of distance (291.6) and struggles with accuracy (59.35%) will be mitigated by the way the course sets up.
Spieth  ->  positive

Fowler also happens to be a great putter, but great putting has not been a requirement for winning at PGA National. That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance."

After a very exciting US Open – that played much easier than expected thanks to the width of the fairways which I completely under-rated – the Tour stops in Connecticut for the Traveler’s Championship, with a remarkably packed field. Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy are some of the highlights at the top of the field, but there are plenty of good options in the value range as well. The Course  The Traveler’s Championship is played at TPC River Highlands, a Pete Dye design, which means it shares some common characteristics with the other Dye-designed courses (RBC Heritage, The Players, etc.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

I’m leaning bombers, but if you’re going to side with a shorter hitter this week, place an emphasis on approach, short game and look for them to end up inside the top 20 for the event in putting. Since putting has the most variance hole-to-hole, the safer option is to load up on the deeper drivers and birdie makers as overall strategy  2018 Waste Management Open Picks — Targets From Each Range  Hideki Matsuyama  The Hideki-Bot got a grain of sand stuck in his motherboard Saturday at the Farmers and things went sideways quickly. Still, he got his game righted Sunday, and enters as the back-to-back in Phoenix, with no finish worse than T4 in his four career starts at this event.
Hideki  ->  positive

He has played well around Waialae in the past finishing 20,13,13 in his last three starts. Harman looks to be a good fit for this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, fourth in GIR, 22nd in SGTTG and 11th in SG Putting. With a decent record here and excellent current form Harman looks worth backing here this week.
Harman  ->  positive

Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Given how well the frontrunners fare, picking out the winner after the opening round should prove far easier than finding him before the off but I have thrown a few pounds at three big outsiders. Last year's Sony winner, Fabian Gomez, who finished sixth on debut here 12 months ago, looks worth chancing at a triple-figure price and I quite like Aaron Baddeley and Vaughn Taylor too. Baddeley ranked fifth for Scrambling on the PGA Tour last year and he finished fourth at the Australian Open last time out and Taylor finished eighth and fourth here, in 2005 and 2006, on his only two previous appearances.
Aaron Baddeley  ->  positive

Russel Knox ($8,200) – Knox is just another golfer with supreme talent who is priced down in a big way. At $8,200, Russell Knox is one of my favorite plays this week. He ranked 8th in Driving Accuracy Percentage and 9th in Greens in Regulation Percentage in 2016.
Knox  ->  positive

(Perhaps this is the way to play the event in-running?) Whilst I suspect many of the faces will be solid in their top-10 efforts there is ample opportunity to make a profit from the less-fancied and/or under-rated types and we will go for a  Top of my list is the improving Kiradech Aphibarnrat, who has risen 85 places on the world rankings from 2014-2017 and has taken a further leap up to 29th after making the quarter-finals of the WGC Matchplay at the end of March. Just looking at his more recent form, the 29-year-old finished 6th in Turkey to Justin Rose (joint-leader into Sunday), runner-up to Jon Rahm at the DP Championship, 5th to Rose (again) in Indonesia and 5th to Mickelson and Thomas in the WGC Mexico, all winners being very highly fancied at Augusta this week.
Kiradech Aphibarnrat,  ->  positive

Tony Finau at 45/1 - frustrated to sit out last week but can make up for it  1pt e.w. Ryan Palmer at 150/1 - plays well in his home state and better last time  1pt e.w.

In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging. Last year Cauley shot his best round ever here with a 66 in the third round and also ranked number one in Par 5 Scoring for the week, which shows an increasing level of comfort with the venue. Cauley ranks 10th on tour in approaches this season and he’s also had success on other Jack Nicklaus designed courses in 2017, with a T3 at the Career Builder and a solid week at the Honda Classic.
Cauley  ->  positive

Priced at only $7,800, he offers a ton of upside for GPP contests. Zach Turcotte: Luke Donald ($7,600)  The tour moves to Florida this week and with that, a lot of players will be headed back home, one being Luke Donald. Donald, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, has been very successful at PGA National over the years.
Luke Donald  ->  positive

Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts.

Dave Tindall previews the 81st Masters at Augusta National...  Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 6 places        I've thought long and hard about this over the last few weeks and I've finally come to the conclusion that Dustin Johnson will win the 81st Masters at Augusta National - and possibly by some distance. When DJ starts breaking Tiger's records, you have to realise that he is a very, very special talent. And although the game is littered with top-class players right now, DJ is the one who will head to Augusta National in the form of his life.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $12,000 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 8-1)    Fowler is the overwhelming favorite this week, and while we list him here, we're not sure he will make our six-man lineup (if you enter lots of lineups, that's a different story). Fowler has had a lot of time to think about missing a prime chance at the U.S. Open, and we should see where his head is at first thing on Thursday. That said, Fowler checks off all the boxes: 11th in SG: Tee-to-Green, seventh in SG: Putting and first in scrambling.
Fowler  ->  positive

Selections    I toyed with backing Ryan Moore, in the hope that he can get the flat-stick working, but the price has gone now so I'm happy to leave him out This is a very tough tournament and I was tempted to lay the front end of the market (apart from Moore) before the off and see where that took me but in the end I've decided to kick the event off with some very small wagers on three outsiders. Cheeson Hadley and Trey Mullinax have both won the Web.com Tour's Rex Hospital Open in Raleigh (about an hour away) and both rank fairly highly for Greens In Regulation. Hadley, who lives in Raleigh, has been in fair form this year - he won on the Web.com Tour last month and he was third last week so he could go well and Mullinax is ranked 132nd in the FedEx Cup Standings so that could be a pointer.
Hadley  ->  positive

Other tournament targets to consider include: Alex Noren ($7,900), Sergio Garcia ($9,400), Peter Uihlein ($7,000), Patrick Cantlay ($6,900) and Jhonattan Vegas ($6,500). MY PICK : Paul Casey ($7,800)  Outside of a couple of obvious picks at the top (Rory and Spieth), one of the players with the best chance at picking up the win this week in my mind is Paul Casey. The Englishman has not done the best job of capitalizing on his opportunities the past couple of years, but he’s continued to put himself in the mix week after week this season and has now recorded eight straight finishes of 26th or better coming into the final major (including a T5 from last week).
Paul Casey  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Cameron Tringale ($6,700)  Tringale is a hard player to get right, but he always brings upside for DFS. Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead.
Tringale  ->  positive

Comfortable on these poa annua greens, I can see him continuing the momentum this week at a nice price. RESULT: T35  James Hahn 1pt EW 80/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I like the look of James Hahn this week who's been playing some great stuff on the West Coast and who has course form to boot. A player who can blow ice-cold, finding season-long statistics to back up any thoughts on him is nigh on impossible, but despite 3 relative poor outings in the autumn Hahn still ranks 49th for Birdie or Better Conversion, 29th for Strokes Gained Approach and 46th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green.
Hahn  ->  positive

DJ’s 103.63 points per tournament in four trips to Riviera is the best among players with more than one start at this track. Jordan Spieth ($11,300) is tied with Johnson atop the field in LT Adj Bird Avg (16.4) and tied for second overall with his 68.0 LT Adj Rd Score. Players with comparable salaries and LT metrics have previously produced an average of 76.89 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +0.76 Plus/Minus and 54.3 percent Consistency Rating.
Johnson  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Kirk,  ->  positive

Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
PATRICK REED  ->  positive

With the front two in the betting there to be taken on, suddenly this feels like an eminently winnable event. So many of the course specialists are either out of form or out of town and while the case for Marc Leishman is solid, as it is for Brian Harman, I'm not sure either can match Kisner who has the added benefit of being a bigger price. For starters, of the three he's still the one I'd rather have batting for me on the 72nd hole of a tightly-contested event.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

You really need to do everything well to score around here," he said two years ago so finishing second (BMW) and fourth (Dell Technologies) on the All-Around in the last two FedEx Cup Playoff events shows his game is in ideal shape to make an impression. Those two second places at East Lake add to a pair of runners-up finishes at nearby Augusta National so playing Rose 'without Spieth' makes extra sense given that he's been the nearly man so many times in Georgia. It's stating the obvious to say that Spieth would out-putt him if the two were locked together coming down the stretch so I'm convinced this is the best market for Rose this week.
Rose  ->  positive

No one that has played 29 rounds or more ranks higher than Spaun in Proximity to the Hole and only Charles Howell III and Patton Kizzire, both of whom rank 24th, have played 29 rounds or more (both have played 30) and rank higher than Spaun in Greens in Regulation, so it is fair to say he is striking the ball wonderfully. Kizzire is also the only player to have played 29 rounds or more and rank higher than Spaun in Par 4 Scoring Average, so this test looks to be right up Spaun’s alley this week. His T4 finish here 12 months ago was one of four top-10’s Spaun posted in 2017, with two of them coming at the start of this wrap-around season.
Spaun  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.

Jason Day.  ->  negative

16th (2011), 5th (2012), 14th (2014), 1st (2015) and 15th (2016) highlights a player who enjoys this classical set-up and 66/1 with Betfred seems a little out of kilter for a player who's a 40/1 shot with plenty of other bookmakers. Kirk has been putting well enough - 47th Strokes Gained Putting - this season and sits inside our Putting Average 10-week tracker top 13, so it was interesting to see that his TPC Sawgrass performance a fortnight ago was driven by a great all-round showing. 6th for Ball Striking, 5th for Greens in Regulation and 5th for Putting Average generated Kirk's best ever finish at TPC Sawgrass and he also shot a -3/69 in the windiest conditions on Saturday.
Kirk  ->  positive

-- Michael Collins  Adam Scott  It's been 10 years since Scott last played in Memphis, and the memory is not good as he blew the 54-hole lead with a final-round 75 -- and hasn't been back. But Scott is committed to playing the week ahead of majors this year and seems close to putting it together. -- Bob Harig  DraftKings value picks  Kevin Tway  Shooting 77-75 last week should be enough to get most of his backers to back off this week, especially with some more popular names around him this week.
Scott  ->  negative

Close here last year, but he often goes under-owned when he shouldn’t. Sleeper of the week = Lee McCoy. Played great as an amateur here… but the real reason I like him is he has played the course over 1000 times growing up so close.
Lee McCoy.  ->  positive

He has good memories at Riviera, too, a T-4 in 2015 and also winning a team NCAA Championship in 2012. His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott.
Spieth  ->  positive

But I also like McGirt as his 69-68 across the weekend in Las Vegas was good enough for tied 5th in the field - level with Cantlay and Hadley - plus his CV contains plenty of excellent performances by the coast. A steady hand on the tiller might be just what's needed this week on the eastern seaboard and McGirt fits that bill perfectly. RESULT: T8  Beau Hossler 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
McGirt  ->  positive

The pick of them is Bill Haas, and while his overall play in majors is a nagging concern in that he's been consistently on the fringes but never in the mix, at three-figure prices there's a pretty compelling case to be made for him. For starters, Haas is in great form. His third-placed finish in the Match Play was a fine effort and came on the back of several others; it's no surprise that he's up with Fowler in the bogey avoidance (second) and scrambling (first) stats which should mean he can tackle Augusta's biggest challenge with confidence.
Haas,  ->  positive

An ranks 15th in SG:T2G and 57th in Par 4 Scoring. Tony Finau ($15,600) – My favorite risk/reward every week, especially on bentgrass greens, Finau will be sure to get your blood pressure going if you watch closely. He can also shoot lights out when everything is going right.
Finau  ->  positive

So the message is clear, when Rory’s tail is up and he is in confident mood keep him on side as he will more than likely follow up. JUSTIN THOMAS – 12-1 – 3pts Win Eliminated Semi Final  On a very similar theme to that of Rory this week I am keen to stick with the other ‘hot hand’ at the moment in the form of Justin Thomas. I pointed out when siding with JT in Mexico a couple of weeks ago that, with the exception of after his win at the CJ Cup, which basically signalled the end of his 2017 playing year, after each of his previous two wins he had either won again on his next start or the one after.
Justin Thomas.  ->  positive

Spieth has struggled off the tee this year, but leads the field in Strokes Gained: Approach and is 5th in Par 3 Birdie or Better so far this year. Most DraftKings players will have to make a decision between Spieth and Johnson. Spieth is the better cash game play this week in my opinion.
Spieth  ->  positive

Coming off a T-7 finish at Valspar last week, his game and health are both in a good place for this week to end with him holding the trophy. Jonathan Coachman: Rory McIlroy ($12,000)  This week is special for many reasons. Yes, it's a golf tournament, but it's also a remembrance, a celebration.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

The prospects of Spieth appear better than any other player and he gets the vote to show it. There are only two others at the top of the market who make genuine appeal, despite the obvious claims of Fowler and Rahm in particular, and they're Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama ( 20/1 Sky Bet ). Scott's Open record is phenomenally good and, let's be honest, he should've won it two, maybe three times already.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

If he can just roll it at an average pace, like he did at this track last year, the reigning Masters champ will be near the top of the leaderboard. Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Bob Harig -- Jon Rahm ($10,700)  The former Arizona State golfer has made the most of his short time as a professional, earning a spot on the PGA Tour this season by finishing among the top 125 in Fedex points despite not being a PGA Tour member. He's started this season with ties for 15th in both of his starts, including last week in Las Vegas.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Time waits for no man and all that, but in an event he's won twice and never failed to make Sunday, I rate Mickelson's chances better than in-form Brian Harman, as well as former winner Patrick Reed and the rest. Despite the changes to the rotation, birdie average has remained a key pointer over the last couple of years - eight of the top 10 in 2016 ended that year inside the Tour's top 25% - and Mickelson has been a consistent feature throughout his career, including the years subsequent to his Open victory. The absence since October must be something of a concern given that we're talking about a 47-year-old but almost half of his 44 PGA Tour wins have come prior to Augusta and, as mentioned, it looks like the left-handed magician has done much more in the off-season than has been the case in recent years.
Mickelson's  ->  positive

The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Kevin Na ($8400): Na has a pretty sparkling course history here, with a T4 last year, T8 in 2012, and T9 in 2011 being his most recent successes (he missed the cut in 2014). Unfortunately, Na is not the same player he’s been in the past, and it’s shown this season with three straight missed cuts and only two top-10s in cut events.
Na  ->  negative

Other: Jason Day  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, Paul Casey, Kyle Stanley, Anirban Lahiri, Bud Cauley, Graham DeLaet, Byeong Hun-An  – Chez Reavie, David Lingmerth, Harris English, Derek Fathauer, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Tony Finau  Bets  Kyle Stanley 50-1  Harris English 100-1 EW  Anirban Lahiri 150-1 EW  Derek Fathauer 300-1 EW If the trend continues he’s a good enough putter to really take advantage on a course like this. Fathauer is a player capable of putting together some big rounds, and his approach game showed big improvement his last time out.
Paul Casey,  ->  positive

Looking at my sheet, he ranks 8th in Strokes Gained: Approach, 18th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, 12th in Proximity from 125-150 Yards, 27th in Par 5 Scoring, and 12th in Birdie or Better %. Who is being Mentioned on FanShareSports(DraftKings)  $10K+ Range  Dustin Johnson and Jason Day lead the way in tags in the upper tier and will be two of the top owned golfers in almost every format thanks to all the values in the bottom tier. I have no problem going overweight on them and feel we can find some lower owned pivots from the obvious chalk plays in the bottom tiers to separate ourselves.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Approaches 125-150 yards, Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Putting (Bermuda grass), Scrambling. Top-Tier Plays  Zach Johnson ($10,200)  Johnson, although not very long off the tee, still ranked 60th in Par 5 scoring last year. During his Masters win in 2007, you might recall that he laid up on every single Par 5 while shooting 11 under on them for the week, which bested Tiger Woods by two strokes.
Johnson  ->  positive

1pt each-way Rickie Fowler at 14/1 Sky Bet (10 places; 1/5 odds) Ranked first on the PGA Tour for adjusted scoring average his price deserves to be up amongst the likes of Spieth, McIlroy and Rahm. Winner of the Honda Classic in February, he’s played well almost the entire season including consecutive top-5 finishes on his last two starts in the United States.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

What better place than D.C. for Captain America to get his first win of the season? Bill Haas (DK: $9,500, FD: $8,400)    A difficult course with a weak field is a prime spot for Haas to pop. Haas is a Pete Dye specialist, and I’ve heard some golfers say that TPC Potomac has a lot of qualities that you would find at a Pete Dye course.
Haas  ->  positive

5 PGA Tour victories for Moore shows that he can get the job done on his given day and undoubtedly Ryan will be motivated to keep the recent momentum going as at 71st in the OWGR he needs a strong performance to get a spot in the Dell World Match Play. Moore topped Greens in Regulation at a windswept PGA National 2 weeks ago and was 4th for Strokes Gained Putting at Riviera the week before that where he finished 8th. Ryan shot -3/68 across Thursday/Friday to be 3rd at 36 holes, so he's clearly playing some nice stuff as 14th for Scoring Average, 35th for Bogey Avoidance, 9th for Scrambling from the Rough and 33rd for Strokes Gained Putting highlight more than adequately.
Ryan  ->  positive

Negative : Si-Woo Kim ($6.4m) looks like 2016 has gone to his head. Luke Donald ($6.5m) doesn't do first appearances of the calendar year very well and Charlie Beljan at $6.7 million. Ask yourself 1) Why is he in the field?

As an amateur Ollie finished 12th at the 2015 Open Championship hosted at St Andrews and that liking for the coast continues to this day. In his first web.com season last year, Schniederjans finished 2nd at the coastal TPC Cartagena set-up in Columbia. He then landed his first PGA Tour top-10 finish in November 2016 at Sea Island.
Schniederjans  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner and Kyle Stanley are also recent winners who figure prominently but I am going to delve a little deeper and go for Hilton Head hero Wesley Bryan, who is quite an attractive 80/1 chance. It was a pretty tense old finish at the RBC Heritage but Bryan displayed plenty of bottle over the closing holes to pip course specialist Luke Donald by a shot and get off the mark on the PGA Tour. “I got really nervous.
Wesley Bryan,  ->  positive

This will be Casey's third time playing The Sony Open where he finished 30th in 2015 and missed the cut over a decade ago. Casey has one of the best all-around games on tour, gaining strokes all over the golf course. Last year he ranked in the top 75 of every strokes gained category, with Tee to Green (7th) and Approaching the Green (11th) as his best.
Casey's  ->  positive

Selections:  Jordan Spieth @ [9.6]  Tommy Fleetwood @ [50.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter The pressure he was under to perform with such an immense following couldn't have helped his chances and after a terrible opening round of 77, he did very well to make the cut before rounds of 67 and 71 gave his performance some respectability. Fleetwood finished 27th at the Open Championship two weeks ago and that was a disappointing effort given the form he's been in and that Birdkdale's his local links but I think that second fact was the big problem.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

This season he currently sits at 5th overall in Total Driving on the Tour (which is first in this field), and 44th in Strokes Gained:OTT. He’s a long hitter, currently averaging a big 300.2 yards with his driver, but he can get into trouble with his accuracy (64.35%) which has led to some big numbers from Steele in the past. Due to his stellar greens in regulation number (70.96%, 20th on Tour), Steele is a birdie-making machine and will be extra chalky this week, but he has the upside to put up a great DraftKings score even without winning.
Steele  ->  positive

DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK    Grayson Murray– Yep, a little extra dash of bold this week. Whether you’ve been noticing or not, the wacky, formerly toothless Murray has been having a solid season thus far, making 9 of 11 cuts, with 4 of those going for top 15 finishes (including a t-14th finish at Bay Hill a couple weeks ago). Only one appearance here in Houston (t-55th last year), but don’t let that stop you.
Grayson Murray–  ->  positive

As much as I liked Ryan Moore this week and last week, he's notoriously bad following a win. Not a single good showing.
Ryan Moore  ->  negative

Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here. While Horschel closed with a bogey at Colonial, Emiliano Grillo finished birdie-birdie for 24th and some momentum ahead of his return to this event. A year ago, Grillo was 16-under with nine to play but, under pressure from Johnson first of all, he crumbled to a back-nine 41 to finish 11th.
Horschel  ->  positive

He excels in this part of the country and grew up playing these country club-style courses. Haas’ main issue is putting, and for fantasy purposes, he doesn’t make a ton of birdies, but I think Haas is a major threat to win this week. Steals  Bud Cauley ($7,700) – Cauley is another player who has been knocking on the door for quite some time.
Haas’  ->  positive

He has posted a solo 2nd and T3 to go along with two more Top 25 finishes, while making a perfect seven cuts in seven events. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Mackenzie Hughes  Since it's the Canadian Open, we need to represent Canada here, and we're able to do so this week at a very low price. Plus, this player is not likely to be all that highly owned.
Mackenzie  ->  positive

I’m sure one of his early season targets is to redeem himself at TPC Scottsdale and he arrives under the radar. 1pt each-way Danny Lee at 150/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds)  Luke List was another player who excelled tee-to-green but lost strokes on the green (154th last season) but that seems to have all changed. Currently he is ranked 33rd tee-to-green and 30th putting on tour.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Currently 18th in total driving, fourth in greens hit and fifth in scrambling. In seven appearances at the AT&T since 2010, he's missed only one cut while hanging up three top 20s, including in each of the last two years. Nick Taylor … He may not be soaring on the same trajectory as Waste Management Phoenix Open runner-up Chez Reavie, but the 29-year-old from Canada is in the same lane.
Nick Taylor  ->  positive

Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course. Hadwin is playable in all formats this week. Jason Rouslin: Cameron Smith ($6,900)  Smith made it in as an alternate last week in Scottsdale, and he turned that opportunity into a decent 42nd place finish.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Statistically, Chappell also seems to suit the TPC San Antonio course well as he ranks inside the top-40 in both Driving Distance and par 5 scoring, even after his poor start to the year. To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68. As only the ninth most expensive player in the field this week I think Chappell represents good/great DraftKings value and like an NBA player banking in his 3-pointer at the buzzer I am even calling for him to pick up his first PGA Tour victory here, too.
Chappell  ->  positive

It's also encouraging that both McGirt and Lingmerth had finished in the top 10 at the Honda Classic - another event on a Nicklaus course - prior to winning here. Horschel was fourth there in the spring and eighth, alongside McGirt, in 2016. Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here.
Horschel  ->  positive

He followed that with a superb win at the Shell Houston Open shooting rounds of 67,67,69,65 to finish 20 under par in total three strokes clear of his nearest challenger Sung Kang. Henley then travelled to Augusta and finished T11 for the tournament which included a final round 69 and played very steady throughout the week. There are a few stand out stats that make Henley appealing for this course.
Henley  ->  positive

The North Carolina track has staged the regular-season Wells Fargo Championship (previously Quail Hollow Championship and Wachovia Championship) on 13 occasions and Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy is responsible for two of those victories and he’s also the only Euro to have tasted victory at this week’s course, Quail Hollow. With four wins in the last nine editions of the PGA Championship, Europe has reversed a dreadful record in the year’s final major.
Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

I am not too worried about his course history here as he hasn't played Riviera in five years and is a totally different player now. Last week was a terrific sign of good things coming for Day as he definitely did not have his best game at Pebble(it showed on Saturday with a 75) but tied with Spieth with the most birdies(23) in the field and finished Sunday gaining close to 1.5 strokes to the field putting which is much more like his 2016 form. Anytime you can get the #1 player in world with a $1600 price decrease and projected lower ownership(in the top tier at least) you have to consider it in tournaments.
Spieth  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation will always equal scoring opportunities no matter what the scorecard tells you about a hole. Going With The Grain    If you’re talking distance, you need to start all the way up with Dustin Johnson ($13,000) and Luke List ($6,900) coming in at one & two on the Driving Distance leaderboard so far on tour this year. Dustin Johnson is coming off a WD at the Masters because of a back issue, but by all accounts, he looks ready to go.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

However, you can likely create a ton of leverage on the field if you have the guts to pivot off of him and he fails to finish inside the top 5. Scott Piercy  Always a threat in a desert setting, Piercy has begun to rebound following a disastrous 2017. He’s averaging over four strokes gained through approaches in his past three starts and sits ninth in the field on par 5s over the last 12 rounds, leading to T32/T25/T6 results.

Pat Perez 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w  Pat Perez at 40/1 is one of those picks I struggle to make, but also find terribly difficult to ignore.

It was a limited field (78) but it was impressive week for Perez who had not played since the Honda Classic in late February.

Exchange Betting  My pre-tournament strategy for this year is more or less unchanged and I’ve layed the following players:  All players priced 50/1 or shorter, with the exception of: Rose, Spieth, Bubba & Garcia;  All course rookies (eg Schauffele, Frittelli, Finau, Li);  All Augusta non-performers (eg Noren, Reed, Kaymer, Fleetwood, Hatton) and;  Most players with two or more missed cuts this year (eg Fowler, Poulter, Oosthuizen, DeChambeau, Kisner). Finally, if you like a bit of back-to-lay exchange action, my top two to poke their noses onto the leaderboard at some stage are:  Brendan Steele (330.00) who was 27th in his second Augusta start last year and who hasn’t missed a cut since August and;  Kiradech Aphibarnrat (160.00) who was 15th in his only Augusta start (2016) and who has been playing well in top company this year (5th WGC Mexico & quarter-finalist WGC Dell Matchplay.
Rose,  ->  positive

Now he has not won since 2012, when he won the Phoenix Open a week after a meltdown at the Farmers Insurance Open but Stanley has showed close to winning form all season long. So far this season, Stanley has posted three top-10’s, a further four top-25’s and a whole host of other respectable finishes. His missed cut last week was just his third of the season, but the most recent of his top-10’s came at the Players Championship just three weeks ago, where he finished in a tie for 4th.
Stanley  ->  positive

I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag. While I don’t love McGirt’s chances to win this thing, I definitely thing he has top 10 upside and is probably worth taking a hard look at in GPPs.
McGirt  ->  positive

If he keeps the putter hot then there is no reason he shouldn't be near the top of the leaderboard come Sunday. =SUPER SUBS=  Martin Kaymer, Pat Perez      Ryan O’Sullivan (O)  “The Golf Aficionado”      Last Week Points: 162  Segment Points: 287  Segment Rank: 13,991    Season Points: 2,123  Season Rank: 649  Group A  Luke Donald (10) and Branden Grace (10)    Group B  Charley Hoffman (8), Matt Kuchar (10), Jim Furyk (9) and Russell Knox (9)    Group C  Russell Henley (10) and Bryson DeChambeau (10)      Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 148  Segment Points: 273  Segment Rank: 18,942  Season Points: 2,151 Season Rank: 295  Group A  Bill Haas (9) and Branden Grace (10)    Group B  Lucas Glover (10), Kevin Na (10), William McGirt (9) and Jim Furyk (10)    Group C  Patrick Cantlay (10) and Kyle Stanley (10)      ~  Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team each week.

Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Don't set your lineups without checking it out! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jordan Spieth  World Golf Ranking (#6)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($11,500)    I am going back to Spieth this week for a number of reasons. First of all, no matter what stat model I come up with he is right at the top of the rankings.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The American has six top-10 finishes in his last thirteen major starts including a win and four top-6’s and whilst he has yet to make a real impact at the WGC events, beyond his 6th here in 2015, it is worth chancing that he is going to ride this clearly massive wave of confidence right now in another strong-field event. Branden Grace 50/1 (UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Branden Grace played well two weeks ago at Royal Birkdale, largely thanks to his third round 62, a first of its kind in major championships. Grace shot two rounds of level par and a four-over 74 either side of the 62, and the pair of 70’s were impressive enough in their own right.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama  3. CT Pan  MY PICK : Alex Noren ($9,200)  As much as it might feel like recency bias to go with a golfer who lost in a playoff last week, I like staying on Noren here. The Swede was phenomenal in defeat last week, ranking second in Strokes Gained: Approach and fourth in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green.
Noren  ->  positive

England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years.
Poulter,  ->  positive

Let’s get to the picks! My Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests  Jordan Spieth – $10,600  In an event where ownership will be inflated at all tiers of the DraftKings pricing, I am focusing on Jordan Spieth, who I think will be the lowest owned top tier golfer. His recent form is decent, but doesn’t compare to the golfers above him who have a win in the last two weeks.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Leave the bombers at the door; your lineup needs to be filled with the best iron players available. Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Kevin Na  Wesley Bryan  Bubba Watson  Zach Johnson  Ryan Palmer  Robert Streb  Charles Howell III  Luke List  Ryan Moore  Kevin Kisner  Professor's Explanation: For any fan of the PGA Tour, even if you know nothing about golf statistics, when you hear John Deere Classic, you think Zach Johnson, Steve Stricker, and Jordan Spieth. Well, Jordan is off to the British Isles to get ready for the Open Championship, but Zack and Steve are returning for the fun.
Luke List  ->  positive

DJ is #1 in the world in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, and that formula should give him a decent shot at a position somewhere near the top of this leaderboard. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – A missed cut at the Genesis Open may keep some away and make Matsuyama under-owned. Just a couple of days past his 25th birthday, he still has his best golf in front of him, impressive for someone with two wins already this season.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

That should be a great fit for El Camaleón Golf Club. Cheng Tsung Pan ($6,000): Sticking to the Web.com Tour grads, this Washington Husky is extremely accurate off the tee. Like I've mentioned a hundred times already, that's what I prefer to target at this week's short track.
Cheng Tsung  ->  positive

Luke List - $6,400 (Field, 4-1)    List was a DFS darling during the fall season, and he notched his fifth top-15 cash of the season at the Sony Open in January. Since then, however, as fields have improved, List has gone T41-MC-MC. Still, he is a big hitter who tied for 20th in his Riviera debut last year, and he has decent GIR and proximity numbers.
Luke List  ->  positive

Choi    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth, $19,800    It’s clear Spieth and Justin Thomas are the cream of this week’s crop, but Spieth comes with a higher salary due to his strong finish last week at Kapalua. Spieth possesses all the course management and iron game necessary to slay this course, and with a third-place effort last season, he’ll be hungry for more this time around. Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Tie that in with the aforementioned 5th at Harbour Town where he finished well in the worst of the Sunday conditions and Webb clearly has momentum. 21st here in 2011, 4th in 2012 and 2nd in 2015 on his home course, Simpson also finished a half-decent 33rd here at the PGA Championship after shooting a +5/76 to take himself right out of it on Thursday before producing -2/211 across his final 54 holes. All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays.
Webb  ->  positive

Selections  Given all the fun and games in-running on day four of late, I'm keeping plenty of powder dry for Sunday but I've picked out a few massive outsiders to get the balling rolling. The three I like best are former winner Aaron Baddeley, who caught the eye at the Shell Houston Open a fortnight ago when he finished 15th, ranking second for Scrambling, Blayne Barber, who was beaten in a playoff at the RSM Classic last year, and Zac Blair, who I thought was a fair price at [250.0] given he currently ranks second for Scrambling and that he finished eighth at the Shell. Selections:  Aaron Baddeley @ [160.0]  Zac Blair @ [250.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [400.0]  Blayne Barber @ [500.0]  Ben Crane @ [600.0]  Davis Love III @ [600.0]    I'll be back later with my Trophée Hassan II preview.
Zac Blair,  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes.
Rose  ->  positive

An opening -5/67 around the North Course at Torrey Pines in February - and more pertinently a winner of the Jones Cup in February 2016 - would suggest that Beau has the tools to be prominent again this week. RESULT: T70  Brian Stuard 1pt EW 100/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  We were on Brian Stuard last week at El Camaleon where he finished a single shot away from the extended each way places and I'm going to be patient with the Fort Worth, Texas-based 34 year-old who's playing phenomenal golf right now.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

Other stats also look promising as Reavie has been gaining strokes approaching the green and putting once field adjusted. Ownership level will be an issue as you will have to decide what to do for GPP’s while in cash games Reavie is looking like an early lock. As always, this article is published as a first look, things change leading up to lock and SlackChat should be checked as thoughts are changed when new information arises.
Reavie  ->  positive

One the market loves to love, but I don't get it. Selections  I'm monitoring the weather situation, and I'm keen to get stuck in once the event gets started but I have managed to find three to side with modestly before the off...  Billy Horschel has a decent record here for an in-and-out performer, with form figures reading 74-75-3-MC-3-4-MC. He's been largely in the wilderness since he won back-to-back FedEx Cup events back in 2014 but the 31-year old Floridian was a winner in Texas last year at the Byron Nelson Championship and he finished runner-up at the Houston Open in 2013 so he clearly likes playing here.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Dustin Johnson ($13000): This is one of the bolder fades to make this season, because DJ fits every aspect needed to succeed here – without rattling off his stats, he’s long, he scores, and he knows how to win. The reason to fade him here is purely based on his salary, and NOT the fact that he missed the Masters with a back injury, because that will just help drive his ownership down and scare people off to the point where DJ will be available at disgustingly low ownership.
DJ  ->  negative

Stud Picks  Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Spieth gets the nod over Dustin Johnson this week for me. Both have won on Poa grass this year but Spieth seems the better fit for a new course with apparently very tricky greens and a layout where power off the tee might not matter much. For all Spieth has done he’s actually never won a WGC event so the motivation to get that in his trophy case is there as well, as is the desire to catch DJ in the OWGR.
Spieth  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Rickie Fowler $10,500 – Fowler is the one guy out of the top four on DraftKings we just can’t roster. You can make great cases for the other three up top (all previous winners here), but Fowler’s inability to close in strong fields like this is concerning. We mentioned that you have to roster the winner this week.
Fowler  ->  negative

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Time waits for no man and all that, but in an event he's won twice and never failed to make Sunday, I rate Mickelson's chances better than in-form Brian Harman, as well as former winner Patrick Reed and the rest. Despite the changes to the rotation, birdie average has remained a key pointer over the last couple of years - eight of the top 10 in 2016 ended that year inside the Tour's top 25% - and Mickelson has been a consistent feature throughout his career, including the years subsequent to his Open victory. The absence since October must be something of a concern given that we're talking about a 47-year-old but almost half of his 44 PGA Tour wins have come prior to Augusta and, as mentioned, it looks like the left-handed magician has done much more in the off-season than has been the case in recent years.
Mickelson's  ->  positive

He’s got a win and runner-up in three trips to the Tour Championship. Whether they reverse the nines or not, Spieth is smitten with East Lake and he’s going to become the first repeat winner of the FedEx Cup. Jordan Spieth.
Spieth  ->  positive

Key Stats for the Genesis Open at Riviera CC Strokes Gained: Off the Tee Strokes Gained: Approach Strokes Gained: Putting (on Poa) Driving Distance Course History    For more on why these are the key stats this week, check out our course primer. Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st.
Johnson  ->  positive

He is 10th in Long Par 5 Scoring and is right around tour average on Approach from outside of 200 yards. Schauffele is by no means a cash play this week, but he’s worth a look in a GPP. Honorable Mentions: Kevin Kisner ($7,500) and Jason Kokrak ($6,600)  I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is matt13jones) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Mickelson clearly loves Augusta and with his great current form and natural right to left shape, he could be a huge contender here. Paul Casey 22/1  Casey arrives to Augusta in great form and will be feeling particularly confident after winning at Copperhead a few weeks ago at the Valspar. His form figures read 7,19,11,8,49,12,1,17 in his last eight starts.
Casey  ->  positive

The three I like best are former winner Aaron Baddeley, who caught the eye at the Shell Houston Open a fortnight ago when he finished 15th, ranking second for Scrambling, Blayne Barber, who was beaten in a playoff at the RSM Classic last year, and Zac Blair, who I thought was a fair price at [250.0] given he currently ranks second for Scrambling and that he finished eighth at the Shell. Selections:  Aaron Baddeley @ [160.0]  Zac Blair @ [250.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [400.0]  Blayne Barber @ [500.0]  Ben Crane @ [600.0]  Davis Love III @ [600.0]    I'll be back later with my Trophée Hassan II preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Blayne Barber,  ->  positive

Woods is also coming off a week of rest and has committed to playing this week and next week at Bay Hill, which will likely be his final competitive prep before The Masters. The top part of the field this week is so good that I haven’t even mentioned the top South African contingent (Grace, Louis, Schwartzel) or young guns like Ollie Schniederjans and Cam Smith. The course this week is legitimately one of the best on the PGA Tour, so seeing this type of field should make for great viewing.
Smith.  ->  positive

All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week. ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR.

Other: David Lipsky (coming off 2nd place finish, has won at altitude before)  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Gary Woodland, Paul Casey, Martin Kaymer, Louis Oosthuizen  – Thomas Pieters, Pablo Larrazabal, Alex Noren, Danny Willett, David Lipsky, Ben An, Jason Dufner  Good luck with your DraftKings WGC Mexico Championship lineups and picks, and make sure you’re checking back on our Golf Picks section to get Keagan and Alex’s picks that will be posted by Tuesday evening. He’s played great at the Omega Masters over the years (won there in 2015 and runner-up in 2012) so can definitely handle the altitude shift. Don’t forget that he finished T5 in his second last start and won’t have to deal with questions about fan behavior here; and that should help him get out of his own head this week.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 5 of the predictor are Luke List (No.1), Graham DeLaet, Chris Kirk, Graeme McDowell and Danny Lee. DraftKings Predictor Model : For those of you who play DraftKings there's now a dedicated predictor model available here .
Danny Lee.  ->  positive

This top finish reminded everyone just how good he is, and hopefully he can build on that and return to th form he showed last year. In 2016, Chappell had three 2nd’s, a 3rd and a host of top-10’s but still remains win-less on the PGA Tour. Many have touted him as the best player on Tour without a win, and it certainly looks like a case of when, not if he does get that first PGA Tour win.
Chappell  ->  positive

Mackenzie Hughes captured his maiden tour title at The RSM Classic during the Fall Series. Hudson Swafford and Jon Rahm registered on the West Coast Swing claiming the CareerBuilder Challenge and Farmers Insurance Open before Canadian Adam Hadwin broke into the winner's circle with victory at the Valspar Championship in Florida. In Europe, Tommy Fleetwood won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship before a runner-up finish to Dustin Johnson at the WGC-Mexico Championship which guaranteed his ticket to Augusta.
Swafford  ->  positive

7. Jordan Spieth, United States -- There probably was no way Spieth was going to match his 2015 season, when he won five times, rose to No. 1 in the World Golf Rankings and won the FedEx Cup, but most players would take the year he is having.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Russell Henley, $9,800 – Henley out-birdied Tim Clark for his first PGA Tour win at Waialae back in 2013, and since has notched a couple more top-17s, proving his win wasn’t a fluke. Henley is a strong fit for this venue given his strong balance of distance and accuracy off the tee combined with solid putting. Cameron Smith, $9,300 – Smith started off with a trying 75 last week but reined it in the last three rounds as he climbed back into 17th.
Russell Henley,  ->  positive

He still carded yet another top-ten finish, so disregard him at your own peril. Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout.
Rahm:  ->  positive

He also plays Poa Annua putting surfaces extremely well as his record both here and at The Barclays tournament highlights clearly - 1st Ridgewood (2010), 2nd Plainfield (2011) and 5th Ridgewood (2015).

Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Here are the bets we at the Golf Family like this week in the side markets at Bay Hill. Jason Daniels – Matthew Fitzpatrick to be the First Round Leader (80/1) and to finish inside the Top-20 (7/2)  Whilst Fitzpatrick’s form of late is a worry, his Tee-to-Green game is still in decent shape and he will be looking to build on that as he looks for some form ahead of Augusta. The Englishman comes alive at this time of year, when looking to fine-tune his game ahead of the year’s first major and this has been a positive stop for him so far in his still relatively short career.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

A Name to Remember  Over the last two events at Glen Abbey, Chez Reavie has perfect Consistency and has averaged a tasty 81.75 DraftKings PPT with a +32.2 Plus/Minus. Importantly, Reavie has been striking the ball extremely well in his last five tournaments; he has made every cut and finished as high as fourth at the St. Jude Classic. Reavie’s hefty 17.5 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks second in this week’s field.
Reavie  ->  positive

The latter three are all outside the top 120 in the world rankings, so if they can....    Oosthuizen didn't have his best stuff at the Masters (T41) but had been in decent nick before that while Grace has improved from T27 at Augusta National to T11 at The Heritage (like this, a Pete Dye track) before T10 in last week's Texas Open. In fact, Futureoffantasy.com's list of top 25 performers on Pete Dye courses shows Grace ranked 8th while he's third in the table measuring his Pete Dye numbers against Expected Strokes Gained elsewhere. It's Bermuda greens at TPC Louisiana and Oosthuizen performs relatively better on such surfaces than he does on other grass types.
Grace  ->  positive

The Golfers  Paul Casey ($8100) – Casey was a write-up to play at the U.S. Open but unfortunately lost his putting stroke yet again, which will make him a tough play to stomach – and he will come with some ownership after finishing T7 here in ’08 and sitting at a reasonable price. That putting stroke may yet be the death of both Paul Casey and the DFS players that keep playing him, but he’s had decent approach putt numbers this season which bodes well on a course where golfers won’t be pin-seeking – just turn the TV off of you see him standing over a 4’ putt. With the putting caveat out of the way, there are so many aspects of Casey’s game that set him up very well for success here nine years later:  Driving Accuracy 65.44 (43 rd )  ) Greens in Regulation 70.70% (3 rd )  ) Par-4 Scoring 3.97 (5 th )  ) Bogey Avoidance 12.81% (T3)  Beyond just the statistical plusses, Casey can hit screamers off the tee and clearly can hit the fairway at an above average clip.

Once one of the Top 10 golfers in the world, Snedeker is just trying to get back to playing consistent golf with no relapse of injury. I love Snedeker’s upside in a soft field and priced at just $7,700 with a three-round cut. Johnny Vegas ($7,500) – Johnny Vegas is looking to add consistency to his resume this year.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Stenson admits he's not playing as consistently well as he was but that was the case last year and, with all the feelings flooding back, I'll back him for Top 5 at [9.0]. Rickie Fowler looks a little too short in the betting so I'll round off with a Top 10 punt on Hideki Matsuyama at [3.5]. If that lands and the Garcia/Stenson punts don't, we still make a profit on the week.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green. Haas came T14 last year at the Heritage, so there is potential he can crack inside the top 15 again.
Haas  ->  positive

Michael Collins -- Dustin Johnson ($11,700)  Now that the PGA Tour will switch the nines (finishing the Tour Championship on a par-5 instead of a par-3 at East Lake), expect DJ to be part of the fireworks in the final round since he's got a Sunday scoring average of 68.7. Last year, Johnson dropped a Sunday 64 and in 2013 he shot four rounds in the 60s. He's got 10 million reasons to play well.
DJ  ->  positive

Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9100 FD: $8900  All season watching Finau play I have been waiting for the inevitable breakout win and where better than this weak field. Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory. The weakest part of Finau’s game is accuracy off of the tee; according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, we can see it is the only category he significantly loses stroked to the field in.
Finau  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well. Other to Consider: Rickie Fowler (Cash)  Mid-Tier Targets:  David Lingmerth (DK: $8,500, FD: $7,200)    Lingmerth won the Web.com event when it was played at TPC Potomac a few years ago, and he is playing some great golf at the moment.
Haas  ->  positive

He's played well here when not at his best and with course form figures that read 53-5-6-6-26-17, I thought he was well worth following in the place markets especially.

A fast starting -6/64 put him in 4th spot here 12 months ago and he finished a respectable 27th at -11/269. On his 3rd visit to Waialae, I hazard that Smith is a different level player 12 months down the line and his motivation will undoubtedly continue to remain high as he strives to qualify for Augusta and the 2018 Majors, all of which he has no exemptions for.

As per usual in Texas, wind should be a factor throughout the tournament with a steady breeze likely reaching 10-15mph each day.

Hoffman is known to excel in the state of Texas, while the 41-year-old has also notched four top-25s in his last six starts.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Sean O'Hair  O’Hair is coming on strong with eight consecutive rounds of par or better on tough tracks. Put together, they yielded a T12 at Copperhead and a T7 at Bay Hill. The last time he connected eight straight scores of par or better, it was his last trip to the Lone Star State 10 months ago.
Sean O'Hair  ->  positive

I don’t really lack confidence so when those things happens I just stay confident and keep doing what I’m supposed to keep doing. I think that’s what really good players do.”  The weekends off gave Varner some more time to relax, reflect and recharge (oh, and he got to watch plenty of his beloved Cleveland Cavaliers; Varner was born in Akron, Ohio). He arrived at Harbour Town and made the cut at the RBC Heritage, finishing solo 68th.
Varner  ->  positive

While Hoffman’s recent form tends to be only mildly predictive of future success, he certainly looked quite sharp at the API, so I’d keep him on your radar as a relatively safe option this week. Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him.
Uihlein  ->  positive

Look for the no-cut event to yield low scores and perhaps a Justin Thomas three-peat, which would be the first on the PGA Tour since Steve Stricker three-peated the John Deere Classic from 2009-2011.

LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th. At best however if you catch Lucas on the right week, in tough conditions, with ball striking at a premium and a few putts drop, he is still a class act and can get right in the hunt and, as a three time winner on tour including a US Open, he does know how to win a golf tournament!
Lucas Glover.  ->  positive

More realistic are the claims of Luke List, Jason Kokrak and Jamie Lovemark, three big-hitting maidens who have all looked like winners-in-waiting for some time, and all have something to recommend them here. However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark.
Johnson  ->  positive

While he hasn’t registered a win on the year, a T5 at the U.S. Open and top-five placings at both the WGC China event and the WGC Match Play are definitely worth noting. Haas has played Firestone seven times over his career, and he has two finishes inside the top 20, with his career best being a T7 back in 2013. It’s worth noting, however, that Haas does seem to set up well for the course based on his season-long stats which include ranking sixth in Par 4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards and also being inside the top-10 in Bogey Avoidance.
Haas  ->  positive

That includes a win at the Farmers Insurance Open two weeks back and a 5th at the Australian Open in late November. Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top.
Day  ->  positive

Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
Walker  ->  positive

That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

This was after opening the week with a five-over round of 77. Had Harman have just shot level par on the opening day (he broke par in each of the last three rounds), he would have finish in a tie for 2nd. It was a similar story in 2016, when Harman finished T17, as Harman finished two shots shy of the three players who were tied for 9th.
Harman  ->  positive

All selections are 1/5 odds, with 6 places being paid across both tours this week. Pablo Larrazabal 100-1  Chris Hanson 100-1  Poom Saksansin 125-1  Phachara Khongwatmai 150-1    Harris English 55-1  Brendan Steele 66-1  Webb Simpson 45-1  Adam Hadwin 66-1  ADVERTISEMENT  *16 x 0.15 ew doubles = total 4.8 points*  Whilst they’ve only played one Maybank at Saujana in it’s current guise, even those with the longest memories are aware that the top-five are often those that can think their way round, shape shots both ways, and avoid bogeys above making eagles. Players such as Jaidee, Jimenez and Levet crop up from past years, and although the 2016 version was played at Royal Selangor, those close behind winner Marcus Fraser were short-track players Quesne and Larrazabal.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Should he find something on the greens this week, that he has struggled to so far this season, Johnson could well be in contention come Sunday. Despite his struggles on the green, Johnson does still rank 30th in Par 5 Scoring Average this season, and that will help him here. He also ranks 9th in Scrambling, which can be even better once the putter clicks.
Johnson  ->  positive

He’s accurate off the tee and rarely ends up in any deep trouble, missing both the fairway and rough 2.26% of the time (14 ), and just needs a few decent rounds with the putter to contend. Russell Henley ($7100) : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year.
Henley  ->  positive

3rd at the CIMB Classic and 2nd in the KJ Choi Invitational both in October shouts value to me and there are other strong points I really like this week. 50th in Birdie Average and 18th in Putting from 5-15 feet in the embryonic PGA Tour statistics tell a story and Kang's record at El Camaleon specifically and in Mexico in general is interesting. Opening rounds of 67-67 placed Kang in 2nd place here after 36 holes on course debut way back in 2011 and he was still 6th going into the final round.
Kang's  ->  positive

It is tough to see Hughes wining twice in his first full season on Tour but I think he represents good value at 225/1, as he has proved he is suited to these sort of courses already this season. Luke Donald to finish in the top-10 7/1 (BetVictor) 2pts  Donald was 200/1 to win last week at the Genesis Open, so despite his good week I am not that inclined to take him at 70/1 this week. It is important to remember that Donald has not won anywhere since 2013 (Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan) and not won in America since the Transitions Championship (now Valspar Championship) in 2012.
Donald  ->  positive

Pat Perez ($7600): Perez is an interesting play this week, given he’s very reasonably priced at only $7600 and finished T5 in 2015, but the rest of his course history is rather ugly (a MC, WD, and finishes in the 60s) and he doesn’t check every statistical box. That being said, Perez has been excellent this year out of the rough (40’2” to the pin, 22nd) and is great with a short iron in his hand, and like Ollie is better (relatively) outside 10’ than inside. On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG.
Perez  ->  positive

Early in the week, these guys are on my FADE LIST, but that may change when salaries come out. Might dabble in Bubba and/or Furyk if the price is right but I think Charl and Knox are fades for me. TUESDAY UPDATE: Was expecting a much higher salary for Furyk.
Furyk  ->  negative

Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75. He’s an excellent play this week.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

That could be with Keegan Bradley, who is playing well, has good course history, and is normally under-priced and under owned. Bill Haas is another cash game king who seems normally have a good price to value ratio. Our team of experts at Hammer DFS will not only teach and coach, but will provide quality lineups throughout the entire golf season.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

He trails only Matsuyama and Chez Reavie with his 19.5 Recent Birdie Average. Ross Fisher: I’ll leave some really contrarian picks for Kelly’s Five Under Five piece on Wednesday, but I do want to highlight Fisher, who is currently projected at just five to eight percent ownership. He’s an excellent play — his 304.6-yard Recent DD is good enough, and he came in 10th last time he played Quail Hollow — and non-PGA members could be undervalued.
Ross Fisher:  ->  positive

At only $8,800, he’s a golfer to keep your eye on in the swing season and is a great value this week on DK. MY SLEEPER : Aaron Wise ($7,100)  Wise is one of the new Web.com grads teeing it up this week on the PGA. The 21-year-old enjoyed a storied college career and has seamlessly worked his way into a full PGA membership for 2017, with wins on the Mackenzie Tour and Web.com Tour over the past year or so.
Wise  ->  positive

He doesn’t excel in the shorter approach range, but he’s still sticking the ball an average of just under 19’ from the pin, and with overall good putting numbers he’ll be able to stick some birdies. After finally getting his first win, look for Kisner to try and keep that going at a birdie-fest which is exactly where he plays his best. The “choker” label was shedded at the Dean & DeLuca, and this par-4 stud should be able to post a score of at least -16 over four days which may not end up winning but will be a great DK score and necessary in a winning lineup in a weak field.
Kisner  ->  positive

Hudson Swafford at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - confidence growing after maiden win this year and local ties a boost  1pt e.w.

There have been one or two head-scratching results at the PLAYERS Championship down the years but proven top-level form from an established star or a rapid improver has been the general order of the day.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He's never finished better than T15 there anyway. We saw Webb Simpson - like Bradley, another recent major champ who has had to come to terms with the new putter rule - come within an inch of winning at TPC Scottsdale so it's fair to presume these hugely talented players who tasted big success early have more wins in them. Getting Bradley at 80/1 is a bonus.
Bradley,  ->  positive

Fortunately for Kevin, he’s having his best year on Tour with six top-6 finishes and 16/19 made cuts – including last week at the Greenbrier, which might (fingers crossed) help guide people towards someone like Daniel Berger instead. Kisner fits the model for this course almost to a tee, as a shorter hitter that finds a lot of fairways (12th) and excellent proximity/strokes gained numbers on approach. He doesn’t excel in the shorter approach range, but he’s still sticking the ball an average of just under 19’ from the pin, and with overall good putting numbers he’ll be able to stick some birdies.
Kisner  ->  positive

In the upper tier of DK pricing this week, he makes a nice pivot off DJ and Kuchar who are most likely more popular. Chad Campbell  World Golf Ranking (#161)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($7,500)  FanDuel ($6,800)    Looking at some value for the form section, Chad Campbell is the first name that pops up. He is a four-time PGA Tour winner that hasn't won since the 2007 Viking Classic but is playing some of his best golf of this season right now.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

He has made nine straight cuts this year. Casey has historically played well at Pete Dye courses, but had struggled at TPC Sawgrass before his 23rd place finish last year. Jhonnatan Vegas ($7,300) has made 6-of-7 cuts.
Casey  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin: Hadwin has only played here twice, but he hasn’t finished worse than 22nd in either appearance. Hadwin’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score is 10th, his 60.6 LT SC percentage is 19th, and his 14.4 LT Adj Bird Avg ranks ninth in the field. Pat Perez: With zero missed cuts and seven top-25 finishes in 2017, Perez comes into this event in fabulous form.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

Even in this strong field, Vegas has him at 6-1 while no other golfer is better than 11-1. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  Another golfer sure to be widely owned, Rickie Fowler remains a solid GPP play due to his strong track record and penchant for birdies (fifth on Tour in BoB%). He arrives in good form with 16th-or-better finishes in six of his last seven starts.
Rickie Fowler:  ->  positive

According to our Research Station, Reavie is number 1 in field adjusted driving accuracy of any player priced over $9000 on FanDuel. Other stats also look promising as Reavie has been gaining strokes approaching the green and putting once field adjusted. Ownership level will be an issue as you will have to decide what to do for GPP’s while in cash games Reavie is looking like an early lock.
Reavie  ->  positive

He finished T27 at The Masters at the end of April and followed that with a T11 at the RBC Heritage, a T10 in Texas and a respectable T24 in New Orleans. Grace is the kind of player that has proven he can really tough it out on the stiffer US Open tests with two top 10’s over the last two years. He finished T5 last year in Oakmont and came close to winning in Chambers Bay in 2015 but pulled his tee shot left on the 16th out of bounds which ended up costing him a double bogey.
Grace  ->  positive

So far this season Johnson has been even better, averaging an incredible 93.29 PPT and +14.3 Plus/Minus with a highly desirable 71 percent Consistency Rating. In 58 tournaments since 2014, Johnson has averaged 81.13 PPT and a +7.54 Plus/Minus with 65.5 percent Consistency. During that time he has been owned at an average of 29.0 percent in large-field mid-stakes DraftKings tournaments.
Johnson  ->  positive

Russell Henley ($8200): 16th in Bogey Avoidance is a good place to start for the Georgia native, who’s been having an excellent year on Tour – 1st at the Shell Houston Open, and top-10s at Valspar and the RSM – and should easily continue that here. Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour.
Henley  ->  positive

Deploy at will. Jon Rahm ($9,200) – There were certainly some chinks in the armor last week, but Rahm’s ability to still put up a respectable four rounds despite not having a birdie on a Par 5 until Sunday just showcases exactly how talented this guy is. He has the requisite power to handle the significant length of this golf course, and if he can keep the tee shots reasonably under control, he’s certainly a good bet for a high finish.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

After getting through to the final of the WGC Match Play, Kisner was well beaten in the final, by Bubba Watson who was not going to be denied. Last week though, Kisner teed it up at Augusta, where he had made the cut on his first two starts, but couldn’t crack the top-30 (T37-T43). This time though, he finished a respectable T28, largely thanks to a Saturday 69 on a course that he really shouldn’t be expected to perform well on.
Kisner  ->  positive

The Off the Tee numbers aren’t nearly as terrifying as they would be otherwise, because his lack of distance (291.6) and struggles with accuracy (59.35%) will be mitigated by the way the course sets up. By taking driver out of his hand, Spieth will be able to either use long irons or woods off the tee, and figures to find the fairway higher than his 2017 average. On approach, Spieth is elite in every sense of the word.
Spieth  ->  positive

In addition to his win in 2015, Walker has posted 3rd, 13th, and 16th place finishes here at TPC San Antonio. Last we saw of Walker, he posted three straight rounds under par at Augusta to finish inside the top-20. Walker bombs it off-the-tee, plays well in the wind and is a great putter.

The week after the CJ Cup, Kang stayed in his homeland for the KJ Choi Invitational played at Jeongsan Country Club. A stunning final round -6/66 placed Kang in a play-off where across a 4-hole marathon he was eventually beaten into 2nd place. So I was surprised to see such a good price about the talented 30 year-old who sits at an interesting 78th in the OWGR.
Kang  ->  positive

Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016. At 66th in the PGA Tour Driving Distance stats, Phil has taken an average of 6 yards off of his driving to hit more fairways in a bid to hit far more greens.
Mickelson  ->  positive

I have a feeling he will be chalky, but I will look to differentiate elsewhere and keep my rose exposure. Jordan Spieth ($11,100) – We all know how well Jordan plays at Augusta every year and this is an Augusta-like course in Texas. Where is Jordan Spieth from – Texas.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Burmester should be comfortable in altitude and also comfy with kikuyugrass which is featured tee-to-green here. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 370.5  Last Week Rank: 144  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Tony Finau ($14,700)  Phil Mickelson ($14,600)  Patrick Cantlay ($14,400)  Bubba Watson ($10,900)  Jason Dufner ($10,100)    Analysis: Loads of success on poa annua greens with this lineup. Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Now lengthened to 7,600 yards and the threat of storms making the fairways softer, that advantage could be exaggerated. Matsuyama sits a very healthy 22nd in Driving Distance and should also benefit from the course switching all 18 greens from Bentgrass to Bermuda. On the Future of Fantasy website which measures performances on various putting surfaces since 2014, Matsuyama ranks seventh (2.25 Strokes Gained) and he won on such greens in Phoenix (for the second time) earlier this season.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Streelman ranks 12th in Par 4 Scoring, 23rd in SG:T2G and Scrambling, and 24th in BoB%. Chad Campbell ($7,900) – Campbell has been playing solid golf and making cuts. Continue to ride the form until it loses steam.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

He’s a sneaky pick to possibly pick up the win here too. Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him.
Cauley  ->  positive

Missed event last year but Firestone looks ideal for this long, straight driver. Daniel Berger makes his belated debut at Firestone having withdrawn on the eve of the tournament twelve months ago and on paper it is a course that should suit him. At Firestone you need to drive it long and relatively straight, which is fine for Berger who ranks 37th for strokes gained off the tee.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Had DJ gone on to win last year, four of the ten BMW winners would have doubled up here and Leishman reminds me of two of the three winners that have doubled up since the tournament became the FedEx Cup finale...    Villegas had form figures reading 21-3-1 before doubling up here in 2008 and Horschel's read MC-2-1 in 2014. Leishman's read MC-3-1 and he has a similar profile to the other too as well. None of the three can be described as prolific but it's perfectly possible that Leishman can give it one last push and replicate Villegas and Horschel.
Leishman  ->  positive

He missed the cut, but I can see enough correlating course form with the likes of Danny Lee and Jonas Blixt to suggest that he'll love the test this week. A web.com Tour runner-up finish in 2011 at Midland Country Club in Texas at altitude was behind the New Zealander and English has finished 3rd at TPC Scottsdale in 2016 where he beat Danny Lee into 4th spot. It's also worth remembering that Harris has a 5th (2012) and 2nd (2016) to his name at Colonial and won the 2013 OHL Classic at El Camaleon - 2 courses where Lee has also finished 6th (Colonial 2017) and 3rd (El Camaleon 2014).
English  ->  positive

Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course. Hadwin is playable in all formats this week.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Add in 1st in Driving Distance, 1st for Greens In Regulation and 21st in Scrambling and he really is the complete package. One hugely important factor at the Masters - and this is the final clincher with Johnson - is being able to avoid the big numbers. Check out the Bogey Avoidance stats for this season and you'll see DJ in fifth place.
DJ  ->  positive

Billy Horschel - Billy Horschel hasn’t looked sharp since the Arnold Palmer, but he still has four top-25 finishes and was tied for fourth at the Honda Classic. Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average. The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open.
Horschel  ->  positive

We love him in GPPs! Player to avoid  Patrick Reed $9,800 – You’ve got to fade someone in this top tier on DraftKings, and Reed is the logical choice simply due to form. He did flash a little at the Zurich this past week, but he hasn’t had a top 25 since Pebble Beach in February.
Reed  ->  negative

He seems slightly under-priced for whatever reason, so nabbing him here provides solid value as he owns a promising chance at a top-five finish. Mid-Tier Glue Guys  Chris Kirk - $15,500  Kyle Stanley - $15,200  Sung Kang - $15,000  Lucas Glover - $14,400    Cash-game Target: With just one missed cut in his last 12 events, Stanley’s ball striking has bumped him inside the top 40 of the FedExCup standings. He ranks top-six on Tour in SG: off-the-tee, SG: approach-the-green, and SG: tee-to-green while placing second in terms of GIR percentage at 73.08%.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

The PGA Tour hops down from Las Vegas to Mexico, in the Cancun area, for the OHL Classic at Mayakoba. El Camaleon hosts again, with Graeme McDowell defending the title he somewhat surprisingly won last year in a playoff against Russell Knox and Jason Bohn. For GNN Plus subscribers, you can access our NEW searchable database of PGA Tour results from 2011-present, our top-15 finish chart and season-long trends on DraftKings valuations.
Jason Bohn.  ->  positive

We want to target the golfers with the highest BoB% as that is where you can really accumulate points. Core Plays  Adam Scott ($16,600) – Love the way Scott has been playing lately. He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Ryan Moore 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  At the sharp end of the betting, Ryan Moore has plenty to play for this week with the Presidents Cup team announced in only 3 weeks time. At 18th in the current United States team standings, Moore must know that he needs to put his foot to the floor over the next 3 weeks to get into Steve Stricker's thinking, but a pot full of points from last season's Tour Championship at East Lake where he finished runner-up to Rory McIlroy in turn grabbing Davis Love III's last Ryder Cup spot, plus the 3rd at this year's Tournament of Champions at Kapalua and 9th at The Masters, means that the Nevada man is still in touch with the likes of Matt Kuchar and Charley Hoffman when it comes to automatic qualification. A win this week at a course where he grabbed his maiden PGA Tour victory in 2009 would be ever so sweet and it's certainly not beyond the realms of possibility.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

On the year, Reavie’s had some fantastic finishes including a T8 in the strong Sony Open field, but no Top-25s since January will help keep him slide under the radar. Reavie is another shorter hitter that’s deadly accurate (11th in Accuracy %) which has led him to a great Par-4 Scoring rank of 32nd (4.01) – he’s also great on Par-3s at 18th (3.00) but will struggle on the par-5s because of that lack of distance. With it being a par-70, the par-5 scoring won’t be an impactful loss.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

For a player so consistent, that's an alarmingly poor return and the hope is Haas can step up a level now out on the coast at Eagle Point, which he describes as 'a fantastic golf course' and one he knows fairly well - albeit not quite so well as Simpson. But being member at a course is too easily mistaken for being suited to a course, and while Simpson did outperform Haas at the Heritage last time, that's another event in which Haas has struggled to perform for some time and his overall play in 2017 is on a much higher level. Prior to missing the cut at Harbour Town, he'd extended his flawless Augusta record with an eighth cut made from eight starts there, having previously reached the semi-finals of the WGC-Match Play in Texas.
Haas  ->  positive

However the wrap-around season can clearly help to re-balance the equation with Brian earning 3 pay cheques across 3 outings. 4th on his beloved Bermudagrass greens at the Sanderson Farms Championship was powered by 18 birdies (8th best in the field) and Stuard was also in the mix last week in Las Vegas where a Saturday round of -2/69 placed the Fort Worth, Texas resident into 10th spot come Sunday. 4th in my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker and 18th in the embryonic PGA Tour ball-striking category, Brian is playing some great stuff from tee-to-green right now and that could be perfect as he arrives at a course where he has finished runner-up twice in both 2011 and 2013, placing in the top 10 for Putts per Round on both occasions.
Brian  ->  positive

Playing him in the late rounds on FanDuel may be a viable contrarian strategy, as most owners will choose to load up on Spieth, Johnson, or McIlroy in the late rounds. Oh Rickie, You’re So Fine  With recently increased odds to win, Rickie Fowler is seemingly trending in the right direction. Fowler missed the cut at last year’s Masters, but he had 12th- and fifth-place finishes in the two years prior.
Fowler  ->  positive

Players To Watch  It wasn’t that long ago when Rory McIlroy just rolled out of bed and woke up awesome. After McIlroy won the FedEx Cup last year, expectations for 2017 were justifiably sky-high. So far this season has been a painful disappointment for Rory however, as he’s battled injury and generally been searching for his best form.
McIlroy  ->  negative

He was in contention last week at Kapalua before finishing tied for ninth, where he also had a top-10 a year ago. Michael Collins: Spieth ($11,500)  Seeing as he's never played the Sony Open before, the term "ignorance is bliss" comes to mind. This type of course is completely opposite to what he played last week at Kapalua.
Spieth  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Farmers Insurance Open. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brian Harman ($9,600)  Harman continues to play at a ridiculously high level. After five straight top-10 finishes, his streak snapped last week with a 20th at the CareerBuilder.
Harman  ->  positive

With the way things have been going for the rookie, I would have no issues running him out in cash games this week and is definitely in play for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course.
Hadwin  ->  positive

MacKenzie now lives in Jupiter, Florida, but the others have stayed put or moved to South Carolina or nearby Georgia (Love). Jason Kokrak is a Charlotte resident and others that now reside in the state include rank outsiders, Brad Fritsch, Chad Collins and Johnson Wagner but the three players in the field that require particular attention are frequent course visitor, Bill Haas, and Eagle Point members Webb Simpson and Carl Pettersson...  Simpson, who was born here, went to college here and who still lives here, tweeted back in March "I learned to play golf at Eagle Point. It'll be pretty special to play a PGA Tour event there in May.
Simpson  ->  positive

Lastly, Thomas ranks T13 in SG: Approach-the-Green this season, another key stat this week. There is not much else to say about Thomas really, he has been one of the standout performers of the season, despite getting each of his three wins early on and he can get back to his very best again this week. Since his last win in Hawaii, he does have three missed cuts in seven starts, but he did also post a T5 at the WGC in Mexico and finished T22 at Augusta, on his individual last start.
Thomas  ->  positive

All said, it’s quite likely we’ll see another decorated champion take the trophy this week, so try to fit in as many top-ranked players as you can in your lineup(s). FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Dustin Johnson, $12800 – Johnson is an absolute powerhouse who deserves all the accolades that come with being World No. 1 for an extended period.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice. DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Justin Rose, $12200 – Local resident Rose enters as perhaps the hottest player in the world with three straight top-8 finishes on TOUR. When you pair that with his eight top-15’s at Bay Hill in 12 career starts, Rose becomes a foolproof option this week. Tiger Woods, $11900 – Tiger’s resurgence the last two weeks has gotten golf plenty of good PR, but this week it may hit even higher levels at the storied Bay Hill, where Tiger has dramatically won on many occasions.
Rose,  ->  positive

He’s one of my favorite targets this week on DraftKings and a player you shouldn’t overlook based his sub-par results from earlier in the year. My Value: Marc Leishman ($6,700)  Leishman has had a strong season by any standard thus far as the Aussie picked up his second career win on the PGA this year at the tough Bay Hill CC, and has also amassed a total of seven top-25 finishes in 13 starts so far. The former rookie of the year may finally be ready to reach his full potential this season and has looked solid over his last few starts.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Among these golfers, those who are less than $7,000 could have low ownership: Check out these results from our Trends tool for golfers with salaries under $7,000 and LT Adj Rd Scores between 69.5 and 70.5:  As you can see, the golfers who met the criteria for this trend have been owned at an average of under three percent (with a positive Plus/Minus). This week, several golfers with great LT Adj Rd Scores and low salaries are available: Stewart Cink (who looks like the value chalk play this week), Chad Campbell, and Luke List. Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores.
Chad Campbell,  ->  positive

Other: Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Francesco Molinari, Phil Mickelson, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Russell Henley, Russell Knox, Stewart Cink, Ricky Barnes  – Charl Schwartzel, Harold Varner III, Peter Uihlein, Sam Saunders, Chez Reavie, Danny Lee, Smylie Kaufman  Bets:  Kyle Stanley 40-1  Peter Uihlein 60-1 ew  Stewart Cink 70-1 ew  Harold Varner III 80-1 ew  Ricky Barnes 200-1 ew  Chez Reavie 160-1 ew  San Saunders 200-1 ew He should be able to bounce back here and is capable of taking advantage of a weaker field to post a top ten finish. Last week he gained strokes on the field in approaches over three rounds, but had a terrible back nine on Sunday.
Kevin Chappell,  ->  positive

Between 2009 and 2011 he finished 17th, 18th and 30th and Justin Rose comments when interviewed after the BMW Championship yesterday interested me. Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career.
Leishman  ->  positive

Length of the tee is advantageous and historically much more important than accuracy but it isn't an absolute imperative. The two winners before Sergio, Jordan Spieth and Danny Willett, only ranked 52nd and 32nd respectively for DD. Greens In Regulation and Scrambling are the most important stats to consider and nobody wins at Augusta unless they have a good week with the putter.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Sea Island is home to a growing percentage of PGA Tour professionals these days, which means plenty of guys in this week's field will be sleeping in their own beds. I'll take Johnson, who hasn't won since last year's Open Championship but should be due for another title soon. Michael Collins -- Matt Kuchar ($11,200)  In the five times he has played this event, he has never finished outside the top 25.
Johnson,  ->  positive

Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge. Given he was a late entry into the Farmers Insurance Open anyway, I am not too concerned he decided not to start.
Reed  ->  positive

Hadwin and odds of +3000 is another strong play this weekend. Ryan Palmer - Ryan Palmer will feel right at home considering he’s a 40-year-old Texan and he should be confident than he's been in a while after finishing 11th in the RBC Heritage. Palmer really hit the ball well last week and has now made the cut in three of his last four events.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Enough about last week already, now let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLA (Last week: Rickie MC)    Jordan Spieth– It’s easy to nitpick with the game’s elite, but when it comes down to it, Spieth produces nearly every single week when he tees it up. With much of the attention on Hideki and his crazy good record here, along with local fan favorite Jon Rahm entering the week, it makes me like Spieth all the more. The crowds will no doubt be on his side and he has a t-7th and t-9th in two career appearances here and looks to add his first PGA Tour title since last year’s British Open.
Jordan Spieth–  ->  positive

2nd (Pebble), 5th (Doral), 2nd (St Jude) and 2nd (Troon) have all been off the back of a quiet previous week appearance in 2016. RESULT: MC  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  The punt of last week for many, we know that Billy Horschel loves the FedEx Cup Playoffs and we also know that he's playing rather well right now. Whilst other players of a similar standing such as J.B. Holmes, Scott Piercy and Bill Haas enter the next 2 PlayOff tournaments with the full glare of Ryder Cup attention set firmly upon them, Horschel enters with no expectations apart from his own - plus plenty of momentum.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Positioned to pile on at Harbour Town ranked T29 in greens in regulation, T6 in proximity to the hole and 22nd in birdies-or-better percentage while lining up par breakers. Nick Watney … He's 153rd in the FedExCup standings and ending an 11-year hiatus at Harbour Town. As his 37th birthday looms on April 25, he seems to be in no-man's land in his career.
Nick Watney  ->  positive

Nick Watney … The most felicitous meeting of land and sea (according to Robert Louis Stevenson and, well, anyone else who has ever visited the Monterey Peninsula) sets up once again to be an elixir for the 36-year-old who hasn't recorded a top 25 since early summer. Save the 2016 edition of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am when he was sidelined with an injured back, the Sacramento native has been a regular here since 2004. With three top 10s among 10 cuts made, it's easy to understand why.
Nick Watney  ->  positive

The tournament has suffered a bit in recent years as it’s place on the schedule falls shortly after the Masters and right before the Players. This year it has managed to attract the best player in the world however in Dustin Johnson, but the pickings are kind of slim field-wise after DJ. We’ll get a look at Adam Scott, who is only making his fifth start in 2017, but will only have seven players in the field total who fall within the top 30 in the OWGR.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  negative

Jordan Spieth  Price: $12,000  It's fair to assume Spieth will be the least owned of the top three options this week. Not only is he the most expensive player in the field, but Justin Thomas has won his last two tournaments, while Hideki Matsuyama has finished first, second and fourth in his three appearances at this tournament. While I would probably go with one of them in cash games, I like Spieth, who placed seventh in his only other trip to TPC Scottsdale in 2015, has quietly finished third in back-to-back tournaments and ranks first in GIR percentage, as a contrarian pick in GPP and tournament formats.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
Reed.  ->  positive

Well the season until recently has been the usual mixed bag from Si Woo which we have become accustomed to, however over the last couple of outings things have started to click in to place. Firstly Si Woo played well in the Matchplay to win his group before losing in the last sixteen. Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time.
Si Woo  ->  positive

Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week. Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs. The defending FedEx Cup Champ, Spieth finished 2nd here as well back in 2013, with a disappointing 27th in 2014 in between.
Spieth  ->  positive

I will be using Casey in both formats. Charley Hoffman ($7,900): Although Hoffman came back to life at the PGA, he remains a solid play again this week at this price. Hoffman ranks 5th in Par 4 Scoring, 6th in SG: Putting, 13th in BoB% and 15th in SG: T2G.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Streelman is 12th on Tour in proximity from 200-225 yards this season, which should come in handy on the lengthy par-threes. Mid-Tier Glue Guys    Sung Kang - $14,700    Having qualified for the upcoming British Open with his T5 at the Quicken Loans National, Kang should feel nice and relaxed this week after struggling in the rain down the stretch in Potomac just days ago. The 34th-ranked player in the FedExCup standings is 31st in par-four scoring and due for his first PGA Tour win during what has become his best career season.
Kang  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Farmers Insurance Open. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brian Harman ($9,600)  Harman continues to play at a ridiculously high level. After five straight top-10 finishes, his streak snapped last week with a 20th at the CareerBuilder.
Harman  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler hasn't been as good in his trips here but does come back with back to back Top 5 finishes and despite letting people down(myself included) last week, is getting a ton of attention and will also be highly owned. Third on the list is Jordan Spieth who has played here twice and finished Top 10 both times. Spieth's issues over his last three tournaments have been the putting as he has lost strokes to the field in each tournament(Sony, ToC, Tour Champ).
Spieth  ->  positive

Form of 30th (2016) and 24th (2017) is progressive here and he's ripe for a contending performance. Result: WD Pre-Event  Webb Simpson 1.25pt EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  In this day and age a Webb Simpson win would fit in nicely.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

He’s a great value at this price. Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

3rd at Kapalua in 2015 (-17/275), 1st at TPC River Highlands in 2014 (-15/265), a couple of 8th place finishes at the John Deere Classic (2009/2012), 2nd at TPC Summerlin in 2014 (-18/266) and 4th at El Camaleon this season (-17/267) jump off the page. Comfortable on short set-ups, Streelman is an arch plotter who is certainly one to follow when his putter warms. So positive Strokes Gained Putting performances over his past 4 events is a definite warning to follow the 38 year-old who attended Duke University and who has 2 PGA Tour victories.
Streelman  ->  positive

And outsiders have fared well here of late too...  Last year's winner, Herman, was matched at [1000.0] before the off and so too was the 2013 winner, D.A points. I have fond memories of collecting on Holmes at [38.0] in 2015 so he wasn't a huge price but Matt Jones was matched at [200.0] 12 months earlier. There are some high class players in the line-up this week but it might be worth swerving them all if recent evidence is anything to go by.
Holmes  ->  positive

While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence. With Europeans having a great record at this event — they’ve won two of the past four years — Kaymer should be considered the class of this event and one of the top studs on DraftKings this week.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Another candidate with a similar profile is Tony Finau, who will have been frustrated to miss out on a Match Play start last week as first reserve, even more so given that three players withdrew early on. Finau chose to sit and wait in Austin rather than defend his Puerto Rico Open title but now must win this to get into the Masters, an event he'll be itching to play for the first time given how obviously suited he is to it, and how well he's performed in the other three majors. While his finishing positions don't look all that impressive, in two starts and six rounds here he's broken 70 on four occasions, and last year's missed cut can at least in part be put down to the fact that he'd won just days earlier in Puerto Rico.
Tony Finau,  ->  positive

In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

The big hitters off the tee are the ones that have the best chance to hang around, hence the high prices for Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama, Dustin Johnson, and Rickie Fowler. Holmes is a past winner at Quail Hollow with his triumph in the 2014 Wells Fargo Championship. Holmes isn’t in the greatest of form, but he has two top-15 finishes in his last four starts, with a 14th at the RBC Canadian Open and a ninth at the Greenbrier Classic.
Holmes  ->  positive

Key Stats for the Genesis Open at Riviera CC Strokes Gained: Off the Tee Strokes Gained: Approach Strokes Gained: Putting (on Poa) Driving Distance Course History    For more on why these are the key stats this week, check out our course primer. Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

He’s more of a GPP play this week as I believe there are safer cash options, but he’s an elite GPP play. Jordan Spieth ($11000)  His game hasn’t been at his best this year, but these are the type of events he really brings the best of his game out in. Spieth’s been M.I.A.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

That of course came before he'd won an event on the PGA Tour and showed that the carrot of a Masters place can in fact trigger an upturn in performance levels. Horschel arrived in Texas without any recent form to speak of, yet followed a runner-up finish here with third in the Valero Texas Open, just missing out on an Augusta invitation. He's not played this event since, because he hasn't had to - Horschel earned his place in the Masters in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and performed with some promise.
Horschel  ->  positive

Lingmerth has finished no worse than 16th here at the Old White, with two top-10 finishes in three starts. And despite not closing out the win last week, Lingmerth has been hot lately: He is tied for third in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score. Humpnostication  Another highly-rated player in Levitan’s model, Johnson Wagner, has made five straight cuts here and has a second-place finish on his resume from 2013.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

So in a world where there are question marks about the 2 single-digit market leaders, the relaxed theme of the Sony Open could well play into Marc's hands in his quest to post 4 strong rounds this week. 8th for Greens in Regulation, 2nd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green, 6th for Proximity to Hole and 8th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green show an approach game which is in rude health and Leishman is a proven Bermudagrass green winner who shot -23/261 to win the BMW Championship last August. Brian Harman 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
Leishman  ->  positive

He's been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta. Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn't exactly fit the "bomber" prototype that tends to succeed here, but he didn't play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition's averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance with his driver -- he sits near the top in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes.
Moore  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Jordan Spieth ($11,600) – The kid absolutely thrives under adversity, and given just how nasty the adversity may get this week, Spieth would be my best bet to shine regardless of the conditions. He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He could go overlooked in GPPs this week and is worth a flyer or two as a contrarian play based on his FantasyLabs projected ownership of zero to one percent in tournaments. Zach Johnson: Prior to last year’s 54th-place finish, ZJ had six straight finishes of 26th or better, including a runner-up finish in 2012. Johnson’s 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks third among golfers with more than one start at TPC Sawgrass.
Johnson:  ->  positive

Paul Casey – GPP – DK:$9400 FD: $11600  Definitely check back into our SlackChat as this thought could change but I think looking at pricing Paul Casey could come in very under-owned and give you a top-end talent playing well with low ownership. Casey’s price makes him tough to roster if going for any of the top end guys and I think it is much easier when constructing rosters to spend less on Cantlay, Kucher or Perez. Casey is still playing good golf as he showed with his T9 finish a few weeks ago at Abu Dhabi and although he has no course history he has shown over the years his ability to adapt to new courses.
Casey  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Fowler  ->  positive

He only has one appearance at East Lake, and I think that will affect his ownership. If you are selecting Dustin Johnson at the top, Charl will be in the ideal price range as a player to pair with him, and I think he has some really nice upside for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte -- Kevin Na ($6,500)  Is Kevin Na going to win this week?
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

“The Price is Wrong, Bob!”  The pricing on these golfers just doesn’t make sense. Padraig Harrington – $8,500  This one should be obvious to anyone who plays DFS Golf, but I have to mention the outrageous price on Padraig Harrington. He is priced ahead of Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Brendan Steele, all of which are far better plays than Harrington.
Harrington  ->  negative

The cream of the golfing crop are in Ohio for the WGC Bridgestone Invitational and while Jordan Spieth may officially be just the second best golfer in the world, our Steve Rawlings thinks he'll end the weekend ahead of the rest...  "Spieth's course form reads an improving 49-10-3 and last year's third was particularly impressive given how poorly he was hitting his irons. There were only 58 players in the field 12 months ago, After Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka and Davis Love III had all withdrawn, and Spieth ranked 54 of 58 for Greens In Regulation . He did extremely well to finish as close to the winner, DJ, as he did."
Spieth  ->  positive

Harris English put in a strange performance last week, playing brilliantly one day and awful the next but nobody bettered his six-under-par 65 on Sunday so I thought I'd chance him at a triple-figure price, given he's a former OHL Classic winner, and I've also thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned Aussie, Aaron Baddeley, at a huge price. Selections:  Billy Horschel @ [40.0]  Harris English @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [180.0]  I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Aaron Baddeley,  ->  positive

Hossler is currently trading at 200+ whilst Jaeger is at 250+ Unfortunately the exchange market is fairly weak in this event at the moment so neither players exchange price are quite where I'd hoped for at this stage, but both are still worth supporting..Hossler has also been strongly tipped elsewhere. With Jaegar again it was a case of his ability to go low should suit this event and I was also mindful that one of his wins on the Web.com last year came in a pro am event.
Jaeger  ->  positive

Bud Cauley  World Golf Ranking (#179)  Vegas Odds (150/1)  Draftkings ($6,500)  Dipping right down near the bottom of salary is an excellent stars and scrubs candidate. Cauley first played here in 2012 and picked up and impressive T16 finish after firing an eight-under par. He withdrew in 2013 and will be making his first appearance since.
Cauley  ->  positive

Looking at my Web Rankings of this year's graduates, Ancer ranked 4th of all graduates in strokes gained across all tours in 2017. The top 8 on that list in 2016 all retained their tour cards this season, meaning we should see Ancer pop eventually. He's not the longest off the tee which puts him at a disadvantage lots of weeks but that won't be the case this week.
Ancer  ->  positive

The major concern from the Texas native is his poor course history here, missing the cut three times since the course converted from Bentgrass greens, but he’s talented enough in other areas to ignore that, on top of the fact that Gay has had an excellent season with three top–10s and is coming into the week off of a T42 at the Barracuda. One of the main things that has held Gay back throughout his career is his lack of distance, which won’t be an issue, but he’s above average (34th) in driving accuracy and is absolutely deadly with a wedge. He’ll struggle on the longer par-4s, but expect him to find lots of fairways and score on the shorter holes.
Gay  ->  positive

Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
Spieth,  ->  positive

The tournament was at his mercy and we were on-board at 25/1. In the end you have to wonder if Rose was not only playing Garcia, but also the golfing gods that day and his play-off defeat certainly hit Justin hard in the aftermath, despite his best denials. However 10th at Glen Oaks, 10th at TPC Boston on a layout he struggles on and 2nd last week at Conway Farms highlights that Rose has momentum that only Spieth and Rahm can match.
Rose  ->  positive

Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone.

Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
Patrick Reed,  ->  negative

On the Future of Fantasy website which measures performances on various putting surfaces since 2014, Matsuyama ranks seventh (2.25 Strokes Gained) and he won on such greens in Phoenix (for the second time) earlier this season. Ranked 1st for greens in regulation at Firestone CC last week, Matsuyama's imperious ball-striking should set up numerous chances and it's hard to see how he doesn't contend heavily. He's already shown he's very good in majors - six top 10s - but I'm more than happy to take the 11/1 that this is where he joins the winners' club.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

With Jason Day still struggling tee to green, and the rest of the top players coming off long weeks at Erin Hills, Rory is the target for me this week among the top group and should have an excellent shot at finally bringing in that first win of the season. MY SLEEPER : Anirban Lahiri ($7,500)  If one of the lesser salaried players is going to take down the title this week it will have to be someone who can pour in a ton of birdies; especially since the top of this field is stacked with great names. Enter Lahiri, who is currently ranked fourth in Birdie Average, ninth in Birdie or Better Percentage and 16th in par four Birdie or Better Percentage.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

He’s an easy play at this price. VALUE  Charley Hoffman ($7,900) – Sir Charles returns after his somewhat disappointing finish at Quail, and seeing as the course has tee boxes, fairways, and greens, there’s simply no way I won’t own at least some Charley Hoffman. He’s playing far too strong of golf for me not to want to a good bit of him, and I would expect that a return to his contending form is imminent.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson  3. Matt Kuchar  MY PICK : Russell Henley ($7,800)  There are a couple of different plays under $8k I really like this week, and Henley is definitely one of them. If you take out his missed cut at the Career Builder (a pro-am format some players don’t like) then you’ll see that in Henley’s remaining 12 competitive rounds in 2017 only one has been over par.
Henley  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Dustin Johnson / Brendan Steele; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Pat Perez; 7) Bryson DeChambeau / Hideki Matsuyama; 9) Rickie Fowler; 10) Patton Kizzire; 11) Kevin Kisner; 12) Patrick Cantlay.

Cameron Smith;  ->  positive

Russell Knox ($7,500) – Bethpage Black simply isn’t a fit for a guy like Knox, but I would argue that TPC Boston most definitely is. Knox’s Achilles heel has always been the putter, but frankly, he’s been putting exceptionally and this course is all about tee-to-green anyway. Keep him on speed dial.
Knox  ->  positive

I do think that Leishman will be somewhat popular, so he makes more sense for cash games, but he certainly has the potential to pop high enough to be worth a consideration in tournaments. Other Options: Bubba Watson (GPP), Adam Scott    Value Plays    Kevin Kisner (DK: $7,100, FD: $5,800)  Kisner has hit a rough patch in form, but Firestone seems like a course where he can get back on track. Kisner isn’t super long off the tee, but he is accurate and has one of the better approach games on tour.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

The PGA Tour stays in Florida for this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational and Dave Tindall has three bets for the showdown at Bay Hill where eight-time winner Tiger Woods heads the market...  "This is a venue where past course form seems to count for more than average and Rose has a second in 2013, a third in 2011, an eighth in 2006 and, most recently, T13 (2017) and T9 (2016) the last two years." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Justin Rose e.w. @ 14/1  Presuming his form was decent, backing Tiger Woods at the courses where he's had most success would have seemed a decent strategy when he set out on his 2018 comeback.
Rose  ->  positive

Most Recent Articles  2017 PGA Championship Sleeper Picks  *Find the complete list of the 2017 PGA Championship betting lines HERE! Jimmy Walker (+7,500)  Jimmy Walker captured the imagination of golf fans everywhere with his stunning victory in the PGA Championship last year. Walker endured a 36-hole finale at Baltusrol, shooting 68-67 on the final day to hold off Jason Day’s late charge and win his first major title.
Walker  ->  positive

J.B. Holmes has a great record at this course, although he’s never won here. Holmes has made nine of his last 10 cuts at this event and has finished 12th or better in six of those appearances. He’s not in great form at the moment, but this venue is set up well for his skill set.
Holmes  ->  positive

He already has a win on the year (The Shell) and he will look to bounce back for that missed cut three weeks ago. Sleeper Play  Kyle Stanley ($8,400)  Stanley, like Henley, has the perfect stats to play well this week. He ranks 21st in BA while ranking 26th in BoB%.
Henley,  ->  positive

I am rooting for the Palmer family from much more than a fantasy perspective. John Huh  World Golf Ranking (216th)  Vegas Odds (100/1)  Draftkings ($7,000)  FantasyAces ($4,800)    Looking at all factors this week(form, history, stats), Huh is going to be a staple in my cash games. He has limited upside with just three Top 10 finishes all last season but has been a cut-making machine and ranks inside the Top 5 in my Cash Game Model.
John Huh  ->  positive

After that, he added seventh place on his WGC debut in China and last year’s similar finish on his first start as a professional at Augusta further demonstrates that he has the class to win this week, regardless of who else is in contention. As with so many of his age, Fitzpatrick is in and out so while a modest effort in the Honda Classic last week may raise some concerns, it’s no more relevant than a previous tie for fifth in the Dubai Desert Classic where he told reporters that his game had felt great for some time. Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday.
Chris Stroud,  ->  positive

That’s three wins in his first two seasons at the top table and underlines that this former US Amateur champion has all the tools to go to the very top of the game. Fitzpatrick is a straight driver with a big-time mentality and he was runner-up to Willett in the Swiss mountains a couple of years ago, two months before breaking through at tree-lined Woburn. After that, he added seventh place on his WGC debut in China and last year’s similar finish on his first start as a professional at Augusta further demonstrates that he has the class to win this week, regardless of who else is in contention.
Willett  ->  positive

He's 4th in the field in strokes gained: approach in his past 24 rounds and 25th off the tee. Bubba Watson ($5,900 | 80/1) - Watson hasn't had the best results here in his seven tries since 2010, but he's finished top-30 six times: 22nd in 2010, 21st, 19th, 27th, 37th, 2nd, and 14th. That's a sturdy return at just $5,900.
Watson  ->  positive

He may be a nice low owned stud in GPPs, and could be a solid cut maker for only $6,500. Player to avoid:  Martin Kaymer $7,000 – Kaymer is a big name, 2014 US Open winner, and a crazy price at first glance on DraftKings. However, we will be avoiding him for two reasons.
Kaymer  ->  negative

Currently ranked seventh on tour for adjusted scoring average, this big hitter could thrive in the Arizona desert. 1pt each-way Luke List at 125/1 Paddy Power (7 places; 1/5 odds)  My final selection is perhaps the most extreme example of elite ball-striker, poor putter – Lucas Glover. The 2009 US Open Champion has really struggled on the greens of the past few seasons and it got so bad he had to drop into the Web.com Final Series in 2015 to regain his card.
Lucas Glover.  ->  positive

He's very much the worthy favourite. Selections  I fancy Stenson to contend so I've had a small saver on him and I've also backed one of Dave Tindall's picks, Jason Dufner, for the reasons he's already outlined. My third and final pick is Harris English, who last year went off at around [32.0].
Stenson  ->  positive

He's a nice price at around 14/1 and I can see him contending. Selections    I've already got Rickie Fowler onside, after I backed him at Christmas when I wrote this piece here but whether I'd be going in now at around 22/1 after a disappointing missed cut in Memphis last week is debatable. Fowler ranks number one for Total Driving and he's a terrific links player and wind exponent.
Fowler  ->  positive

Selection  Pat Perez 33/1 (Boylesports 5 places 1/5 or William Hill 30/1 4 places 1/4 ) 1.5pts e/w:  Pat Perez has played this event on two occasions, finishing 10th on debut in 2010 and following that up with a 3rd place finish last season. After spending the majority of the 2015/16 season out with a shoulder injury, Perez came back in strong fashion, winning the 2016 Mayakoba Classic and following that up with another win at the 2017 CIMB Classic. Perez seems to have improved as a player not only since his injury but since he’s gotten older and at 41 he still has around 10 years of PGA Tour golf ahead of him, should he stay injury-free and in decent form.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

A final round 77 did for him that day as Troy Merritt took the victory, but with a Presidents Cup spot his if he finishes 2017 strongly and with plenty of top-level finishes across big tournaments under his belt since then, I think Chappell makes plenty of sense this week. Result: MC  David Lingmerth 1.5pts EW 33/1 with NEW OFFER! Bet £/€10 get £/€30 free (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  The only renovated course winner in the field, David Lingmerth, has strong credentials at TPC Potomac this week.
David Lingmerth  ->  positive

Jason Day ($10000): Although it’s very appealing to get Jason Day as a “sneaky” play with his price coming as only the fifth-highest, back-to-back champions don’t happen at the PLAYERS. Day has yet to show that he’s regained his world number one form, coming T22 at Augusta and his best finish coming back at Pebble Beach with a T5. His putting stroke isn’t at the same level as last year, and although Day is typically a slow starter, by this time last season he’d already won twice (Arnold Palmer, Dell Match Play) and was entering off a T5 at the Zurich rather than a missed cut like this year.
Day  ->  negative

Luxury Items  Jordan Spieth ($11,400 DraftKings/$10,100 FanDuel) – After firing an encouraging 68 in the final round of the US Open, I have a feeling that many people will be on Spieth this week, but I can’t find any reason not to play him. Spieth leads the field in strokes gained approach, is 2nd in greens in regulation, 2nd in proximity and 4th in par 4 birdie percentage. I think this is going to be a big week for the young Texan, as I predict that he wins this tournament and has a score approaching 18 under par.
Spieth  ->  positive

He has struggled overall with his approaches recently but this break may be exactly what he needed to turn it around. Paul Casey ($9,900)  Like Mickelson, Paul Casey hasn’t played since the Masters, where he placed sixth. His game looks to be in prime form to tackle the Eagle Point Golf Club.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

10th (2014) and 4th (2017) at Sea Island and 3rd at PGA West (2017) also marry-up perfectly from a comfortable on TifDwarf Bermudagrass greens perspective. Cameron Smith 1pt EW 40/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Regular readers will know I'm a fan of Cameron Smith and golf betting is often a game of patience. Scrolling down to the bottom of the Sentry leaderboard early last Friday morning and seeing young Mr Smith ensconced in tied 30th spot alongside Jordan Spieth was not something I anticipated.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

List  ->  positive

Dating back to the BMW Championship last season, Smith has put together four straight top-17 finishes and this week should offer him another chance to keep the good play going. Chris Kirk, $8,700 – Kirk posted a convincing fourth place at the RSM Classic in his last PGA Tour start, where he shot rounds of 63 and 64 in the first and third rounds. Though his consistency has been a bit sporadic, Kirk should feel comfortable on a track where he’s two top-5s and 5-of-7 cuts since 2011.
Kirk,  ->  positive

Rose will look to bounce back from a below-average putting year and taking a month off may be just what he needed. If Rose has just an average putting tournament, he will be on the first page of the leaderboard on Sunday and there is no telling how low he can go if the flat stick gets hot. Value Picks and Sleepers  Daniel Berger ($8,800)  Berger is coming off a 14th-place finish in last week's ToC and a runner-up in the WGC HSBC Championship back in October.
Rose  ->  positive

He hasn't missed a cut on teh PGA Tour since the Sony Open back in January and his last five finishes have been T5, 26th, T10, T22, and T12.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Lock him up! Player to avoid  Bud Cauley $9,500 – Bud Cauley is a good golfer and we are sure he’s a nice guy and all, but we just can’t see playing him this week at his price with so many better options above and below him. Coming off four straight top-10 finishes probably does justify the price, but we just aren’t buying it this week.
Bud Cauley  ->  negative

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Need he do more? Rahm has demolished everything and everyone in his path.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

One of my favorite bargain plays this week is Xander Schauffele ($6,400). The knock on Schauffele is his ball striking but his approach game has steadily improved over his last three starts. He is 10th in Long Par 5 Scoring and is right around tour average on Approach from outside of 200 yards.
Schauffele  ->  positive

-8 and -7 were the winning scores of the two Web events, and with the screws cranked up for a PGA event, unless someone like Rickie or Thomas goes mental with their irons, expect a tough track. Quicken Loans National Picks (Yahoo Game)  Brendan Steele & Bill Haas – After churning out another T15 at the Travelers, Steele has now reeled off 21 consecutive cuts made dating back to July of 2016 and has the ideal consistency for a player taking on an unknown course. One of the premiere Par 4 scorers in the field, Steele also sits 14th on the season in scrambling… Haas doesn’t exactly hit every fairway anymore, but he’s continued to churn out quality results based around his consistency and top tier short game.
Haas  ->  positive

On a four day event without fear of a missed cut, he’ll have lots of time to calm himself down and put low numbers (relatively), so he should be fine. Looking at his statistics on the year (PGA only, doesn’t include his absurd 6-shot victory at the Irish Open), Rahm crushes in almost every key category:  4 th in Par-4 Scoring / 5 th in Par-5 Birdie or Better %  in Par-4 Scoring / 5 in Par-5 Birdie or Better % 20 th in Bogey Avoidance  in Bogey Avoidance 2 nd in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green 3 rd in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach  in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach 3rd from 175-200 yards / 90th outside 200 yards  The only categories that Rahm has struggled with this year is around the green (109th in strokes gained) and he’s only an above average putter, not an elite putter (59th). Although there are punitive bunkers around the greens, Rahm will still put himself either on the green or in great position so often that he can manage to give a shot or three back with poor sand save efforts.
Rahm  ->  positive

Those were the words of Patrick Rodgers after his playoff defeat to Bryson DeChambeau at the John Deere Classic a fortnight ago. Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Henrik Stenson 2pts EW 12/1  Justin Rose 1pt EW 25/1  Brandt Snedeker 1pt EW 40/1  Branden Grace 1pt EW 45/1  Russell Knox 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 11 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter @Doublebogey63  Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Knox has performed well on tough courses this season and if he putts well he could have a decent chance here. He looks to have the game that could suit this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, second in GIR, 35th in scrambling and 19th in par 4 scoring.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Whilst Berger has hardly made a blistering start to the season, it has been steady enough and I am hoping he will build on that T7 finish last time out. On his debut at this event, Berger finished 2nd (lost in a play-off) to Padraig Harrington back in 2015. Berger shot a final-round 64 to tie Harrington at -6 on the week, who could only manage a final-round 70.
Berger  ->  positive

Three of these players (Spieth, Matsuyama and Garcia) are coming off wins in their last starts. Garcia won the Dubai Desert Classic two weeks ago, going wire-to-wire to beat Henrik Stenson by three strokes, whilst Matsuyama overcame the challenge of Webb Simpson in a play-off, to win the Phoenix Open. Thomas has won three times on the PGA Tour this season, winning the CIMB Classic in October, as well as doing the double in Hawaii (Tournament of Champions and Sony Open) in the first two events of 2017.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Koepka is 20th in strokes gained: off the tee in this field and is 8th in strokes gained: approach at this course (among 50 golfers with course history in the past five years) in his four rounds. Rickie Fowler ($9,000 | 18/1) - Rickie always has big ownership, but it's justified because he either fits the course well or is playing well or has played at that particular course well. Fowler has finished top-10 (10th, 10th, 8th) in the past three years at this event and was 2nd back in 2011.
Fowler  ->  positive

The four-time PGA Tour winner and 2012 U.S. Open champion has been in fine form over the last month, and this course suits his game. Simpson has always relied on accuracy over distance, but he also needs to elevate his play on the greens every time he wins. This is something he can do this week, given the immaculate Bentgrass surfaces and the form he has shown in his last two starts.
Simpson  ->  positive

However a much needed 2 months off has seen William return with a little more swagger in his stride - 45th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green, 15th for Strokes Gained Putting, 33rd for All-Round and 6th for Bogey Avoidance in the embryonic PGA Tour season stats make for good reading. But I also like McGirt as his 69-68 across the weekend in Las Vegas was good enough for tied 5th in the field - level with Cantlay and Hadley - plus his CV contains plenty of excellent performances by the coast. A steady hand on the tiller might be just what's needed this week on the eastern seaboard and McGirt fits that bill perfectly.
McGirt  ->  positive

Chappell confesses to feeling comfortable at Bay Hill, where his relentless ball-striking and love for a demanding test is rewarded, and he did very little wrong here when second to Day in 2016, leading the field in strokes-gained tee-to-green as we've come to expect. Video element not supported Kevin Chappell makes an ace at the API  Throw in finishes of 14th and 24th, the latter on debut six years ago, plus second in the PLAYERS, second at Jack's place in the Memorial and second to McIlroy in the TOUR Championship, and it's clear that there's a lot in favour of a player who tends to produce his best golf against the very best. Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous.
Chappell  ->  positive

ADAM HADWIN – 66-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/4 odds 1st 5 Finish 3rd  I will finish my picks this week with two players who have served me well at this event over the past couple of years. Firstly Hadwin who of course notably shot 59 at La Quinta last year before finishing 2nd. It was a big ask for the Canadian to close out the event last year for his first win on the back of a 59 on Saturday and so it proved.
ADAM HADWIN  ->  positive

His Adam Scott-esque putting is the only reason he hasn’t won everything he plays, and that will definitely impact him in a negative way yet again – but on a course where a lot of the field won’t be pouring birdies or getting to the greens, he’ll typically have a chance to two-putt for par at worst. The Fade  David Lingmerth ($8500) – One of the few in this field with course history, the Swede won here back in 2012 when it was a Web.com event, and will garner some ownership just based around that. Unfortunately, where his game is currently is nowhere close to what’s needed to succeed again, beyond his lights-out putting.
David Lingmerth  ->  negative

A T27 finish in Mexico last week followed, and he will be raring to go once again this week. This wouldn’t be the first course you’d pick for Finau to win at, but given his current form and last season’s result I thought it was worth rolling the dice at the price. Byeong-Hun An 50/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Byeong-Hun An has been in rock solid form in 2018, finishing T40-T6 in two starts in the Middle-East before heading to the States and finishing T23 in Phoenix and T5 at the Honda.
Finau  ->  positive

He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions. Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Reed’s  ->  positive

He ranks 25th in driving distance, 32nd in GIR, 12th in SG approaches to the green, 11th in SGTTG and 11th in SGP. If he hits it well off the tee and makes a few putts Fowler could be another one to keep an eye on. Russell Henley 33/1  Henley looks a real horse for the course around here and looks to be playing some good golf lately.
Fowler  ->  positive

He’s been flying under the radar since his Masters runner-up, but he has history at Royal Birkdale and his Irish Open T-4 should prime him for his second major title. Justin Rose. He’s been flying under the radar since his Masters runner-up, but he has history at Royal Birkdale and his Irish Open T-4 should prime him for his second major title.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

Again 12 months ago, Harman put together a familiar week finishing T13, two shots shy of Hudson Swafford and Tommy Fleetwood in 10th. If Harman, who has played the best golf of his career over the last two years can just shave a shot a round off his usual scoring here, there’s every chance he contends and there is no reason to doubt that he can do that here. Harman ranked 2nd in Strokes Gained: Putting in Mexico, but just 31st in Par 5 Performance, so should he improve on the long holes here, he should be bang in contention.
Harman  ->  positive

Angel Cabrera ($6,700) – Angel Cabrera’s recent form isn’t something to be admired, as he’s only played twice this season and missed the cut on both occasions. Still, history tells us that when considering whether or not to roster Cabrera at Augusta, his recent form shouldn’t really be weighed very heavily. Case in point – last year before the Masters Cabrera hadn’t had a finish higher than 42nd all year, and yet still finished T24 at the year’s first major; in 2015, Cabrera came into Masters week having missed three cuts in a row (badly) and yet still finished T22.
Cabrera  ->  positive

I've also thrown a few pennies at another of last year's selections - the 2010 Farmers winner, Ben Crane.

Holmes  ->  positive

Fowler is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee ranking 32nd in driving distance, 36th in GIR, first in SG putting and fifth in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a good history on this course, Fowler looks another big contender here. Daniel Berger 60/1  I am sticking to my guns and backing Berger for the second week running here.
Fowler  ->  positive

Again asked about it on Sunday in Chicago, Spieth elaborated by saying, "For me if I go out next week - not only win the FedEx Cup, I think I have to win the tournament next week to be Player Of The Year or at least have a chance to be Player Of The Year and that's really - that's our MVP, that's the most important award." With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW!

His worst score across eight rounds completed is a two-under 68 and his scoring average is an impressive 66.75, rounds of 64 and 65 last year showing that he can shoot the numbers required on what's typically a low-scoring layout. "I love Donald Ross' design. I think he's somewhat of a genius in terms of architecture and I've always enjoyed his golf courses," Donald confirmed.
Donald  ->  positive

Here are five competitors in this week’s Masters who are generally considered green jacket contenders, but I’ll be avoiding. All odds are via 5dimes as of Tuesday afternoon  Jon Rahm (+2235)  That’s right: I’m kicking this thing into high gear right off the bat by recommending a fade of the world’s third-ranked golfer. Since his victory in Palm Springs three months ago, Rahm has failed to post another top-10 finish in five starts, including an early exit at the WGC-Match Play in his most recent start.
Rahm  ->  negative

He started the season off with a win at the Safeway Open back in October and followed that with a T6 in Kapalua and a T6 at the CarrerBuilder Challenge. Most recently, Steele played well at the Masters finishing in a respectable T27 and followed that with a T6 at the Players Championship and a T13 last week at the US Open. Steele is another player with a decent record here finishing T13 in 2011, T13 in 2013, T5 in 2014, T25 in 2015 and a T17 last year.
Steele  ->  positive

That leaves plenty of room for boom-or-bust options at the bottom. Wise, Hossler, and Burns are all youngsters with top-10 potential while Woods is just too cheap still. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 491.5  Last Week Rank: 4128  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Luke List ($21,000)  Byeong Hun An ($18,800)  Steve Stricker ($13,800)  Tiger Woods ($6,500)  Sam Burns ($6,500)    Analysis: Also going with the combo of Woods and Burns at the bottom.
Wise,  ->  positive

The weakness is his chipping and pitching but he’ll find scrambling easier here than out on the west coast, and having bagged three top-five finishes in five starts he’s clearly started 2017 in the mood to challenge for titles. Another point worth making is that Rose has a real sense of occasion – just look how he primed himself to win gold in Rio last year – and I’ve no doubt he’ll tee off on Thursday with the clear goal of honouring Palmer by winning the first renewal since his passing. With a game made for this course, Rose looks a very strong candidate and is supported accordingly.
Rose  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes.
Rose  ->  positive

The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
Fowler  ->  negative

Prior to Houston, he'd finished seventh in total birdies at Bay Hill and eighth at the Valspar, where he ended up finishing third behind Adam Hadwin, and these promising performances are all the product of his reliable tee-to-green game. Herman is inside the top 15 on Tour for fairways and greens and 16th in strokes-gained on approach shots, so his skill set does appear perfectly suited to Harbour Town, where he made the cut on debut last year but couldn't quite get anything going. With that experience and a first title defence behind him, plus a proven track record on the east coast, the 39-year-old can get back in the mix at what looks a generous 125/1.
Herman  ->  positive

He followed that with a T2 at the Sanderson Farms finishing four strokes behind winner Cody Gribble. Kirk started well at The Shriners shooting rounds of 66,65 but then fell off the pace after a poor weekend. He did however have another good performance in Mexico finishing T7 at The OHL Classic last week which included an opening round 63.
Kirk  ->  positive

He was in contention last week at Kapalua before finishing tied for ninth, where he also had a top-10 a year ago. Michael Collins: Spieth ($11,500)  Seeing as he's never played the Sony Open before, the term "ignorance is bliss" comes to mind. This type of course is completely opposite to what he played last week at Kapalua.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bit late but Scott Piercy (Honda) and Andy Sullivan (Qatar) my golf picks this week. Both in decent form, have play… https://t.co/TuEwJTFOqY
Scott Piercy  ->  positive

It's bent grass and big old divots that you got to replace. For me, that's what I grew up on so it feel good about it," Streelman once said about TPC River Highlands so he's very comfortable here. The scheduling helps players like him go under the radar in this sort of event and, despite his past heroics, the main storylines this week will be whether McIlroy and Day can bounce back from their US Open disappointments or if Justin Thomas can get another win after his stunning Saturday 63 at Erin Hills.
Streelman  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler hasn't been as good in his trips here but does come back with back to back Top 5 finishes and despite letting people down(myself included) last week, is getting a ton of attention and will also be highly owned. Third on the list is Jordan Spieth who has played here twice and finished Top 10 both times. Spieth's issues over his last three tournaments have been the putting as he has lost strokes to the field in each tournament(Sony, ToC, Tour Champ).
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Both victories were ominously impressive, with Fleetwood moving to World Number 12 after successfully defending his Abu Dhabi title and delivering another great winner for our European Tour previewer Paul Williams. Rahm on the other hand showed that he's both motivated and more than capable of challenging for the World Number 1 position by defeating 200/1 shot Andrew Landry in a playoff at the CareerBuilder Challenge. He travels to San Diego this week, set to defend his Farmers Insurance Open title he won here 12 months ago.
Rahm  ->  positive

Selection    In what's a very open heat, a case for favouritism could be argued for many but the one I think should head the market is five time PGA Tour winner and Ryder Cupper, Ryan Moore, and I thought he was a cracking price with the Sportsbook at 28/1. Moore's form slumped a little after his playoff defeat to Rory McIlroy at the Tour Championship but if his first career top-10 at Augusta last time out is anything to go by, the 34-year-old world number 28 looks ready to go in again. This is Moore's second appearance at TPC San Antonio and he did okay on debut - finishing eighth back in 2012.
Moore,  ->  positive

He is starting to remind me of that guy who wore red Nike shirts on Sunday’s. Jason Dufner ($8,800): Dufner ruined several lineups for people last week with his weekend plunge. However, Dufner has a knack for this course as he is 6/6 for making cuts year in the last 6 years with 3 top 10 finishes.
Dufner  ->  positive

When backing multiple players it's also worth looking at how the bracket unfolds first as your fancied players may well meet before they reach the semi-finals, which means that one of your bets will definitely be a loser. The course here on paper would seem to suit more accurate types with the danger that lurks from off the cut-and-prepared, however power has seen the likes of Jason Day, Louis Oosthuzien, Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm contest the two finals that have been played here. An aggressive style and a liking for Bermudagrass greens is a good starter for this week, however ultimately to progress to Sunday a player's going to need to handle the mental side of Match Play golf first and foremost.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

The Swede landed the BMW PGA Championship in May at Wentworth with a stunning final round of 62. This title means Noren has won his last two starts in England, having also been victorious at The Grove last year, which bodes extremely well for this week especially as he has spoken of how much he loves playing in this country. Noren has yet to make a big impact in the majors although he is likely to have positive memories of his appearance at Birkdale nine years ago.
Noren  ->  positive

Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine. With a best of tied 4th at the Texas Open this season, it’s been a disappointing campaign but there have been signs in the last couple of weeks that Horschel may finally be springing into life.
Horschel  ->  positive

In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory. Harman would join Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Mike Weir as left-handed players to have won here since the turn of the century.
Harman  ->  positive

FedEx Cup champion Justin Thomas is looking for three straight wins in the CIMB Classic at TPC Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this week. Justin Thomas has won the last two editions of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the USPGA champion will be looking to become the first player on the PGA Tour to win a tournament three years running since Steve Stricker achieved that feat in the John Deere Classic between 2009 and 2011. A limited field of 78 players will tee it up at TPC Kuala Lumpur with Justin Thomas and World Number 3 Hideki Matsuyama the star attractions.

Trey Mullinax  ->  positive

DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Haas t-12th)    Marc Leishman– I mentioned the breeze above and there aren’t too many better in those elements than the 33-year-old Aussie. Leishman is having a very fine season with 8 top 25s, including a win at Arnie’s event back in March, and has maintained that good form finishing t-15th at the Memorial just a couple weeks ago. Last year at Oakmont he finished t-18th, despite a 77 on Saturday and has been close in majors 3 times before, with a t-4th at the Masters in 2013 and a t-5th and t-2nd at the British Open in ’15 and ’16.
Leishman–  ->  positive

Our man takes a detailed look at this week's PGA Tour event, where Dustin Johnson is a warm favourite to retain his title. Read our man's in-depth preview ahead of Thursday's start here...  “In-form Chez Reavie and Tommy Fleetwood, who should take to the track, were both on the radar but I felt they were both fractionally short so my four are Kevin Streelman, Charl Schwartzel, William McGirt and KJ Choi.”  Tournament History  The PGA Tour moves 300 odd miles down the Californian coast from Pebble Beach to Los Angeles for the final tournament of this year's West Coast Swing - the Genesis Open. In existence since 1926, and originally known as the Los Angeles Open, the Genesis Open often attracts the best field on the West Coast Swing and with three of the world's top-four in attendance, along with Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, we have another strong renewal to look forward to.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Statswise Reavie ranks 10th in driving accuracy, 22nd in GIR, fifth in SGTTG and inside the top 10 for both par 3 and par 4 scoring. Final Selections –  Paul Casey 1pt EW  Phil Mickelson 1pt EW  Ollie Schneiderjans 0.5pts EW  Chez Reavie 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 6pts (Some bookies paying 7 places)  Good luck and enjoy the golf. Doublebogey6
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Instead, head has to rule the heart and therefore it's time to take advantage of the slightly inflated odds on Justin Rose. Tiger's 6/1 means Rose is a couple of points bigger than he would have been without the great man's revival and 14/1 looks very acceptable indeed. The Englishman admitted he'd found the WGC-Mexico a hard event to make his comeback after more than a month off due to the altitude and pulling of funky clubs.
Rose.  ->  positive

It makes sense given the way he strikes the ball - "when I think about my ball flight I hit it pretty low, that's why a lot of people say Augusta is not really the place for me - and this really does look the ideal place for the 28-year-old to get back on track after an indifferent start to the season. Leaving Augusta on such a positive note should be the perfect prep and, as we've seen during his seven European Tour wins, when he gets in contention, Grace is an excellent closer. This is definitely a horses-for-courses event and if you look down the rollcall of champions you'll see five wins for Davis Love and two each for Stewart Cink, Jim Furyk and Boo Weekley.
Grace  ->  positive

He is no stranger to windy seaside courses winning at venues such as St Andrews in 2015, Hyundai TOC in Kapalua in 2014 and the RBC Heritage in Harbour Town in 2012. Top 20 double – Charles Howell (Sony)/Jason Scrivener (SA Open) @10/1  Charles Howell has a ridiculously good record here in Waialae with eight top 20’s (including seven top 10’s) in his last 12 appearances here. He has three top 20’s in his last four starts so far this season and looks to be in decent form and well worth backing.
Charles  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

We're relying on Mickelson having given an honest assessment but he's been good for that in the past and, at the price and in an event where most have some kind of question to answer, he's worth a decent each-way bet. Those who read every word of my 2018 Money List preview may have noticed that I put forward this event as a decent opportunity for Aaron Wise and Beau Hossler, and nothing has changed my mind on that since. Justin Thomas threatened to win it straight off the Web.com Tour and the three courses used are set up straightforwardly, much like most of the events on the feeder circuit.
Beau Hossler,  ->  positive

He fired a 59 at the CareerBuilder Challenge, where he finished runner-up, six starts before he won the Valspar and after six run-of-the-mill outings, I can see him going well again at a venue appearing to suit. Selections:  Zach Johnson @ [46.0]  Billy Horschel @ [50.0]  Phil Mickelson @ [55.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [55.0]    I'll be back on Thursday evening or Friday morning with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Honorable Mention: Adam Scott ($8,500) & Francesco Molinari ($7,300)  Could Sergio Garcia prove to be this weekend’s top option? Read Now  Going Against The Green  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Around the Green  Scrambling  Par 5 Birdie or Better  An argument can be made that either Jon Rahm ($11,400) or Rickie Fowler ($9,200) has been the second-best golfer this season, behind Dustin Johnson. Jon Rahm is $2,000 more than Fowler, though.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Jordan improved his game and especially putting during his last start (Genesis Open) on a course (Riviera) that is very comparable to this weeks venue Club de Golf Chapultepec. As far as stats go, Mr. Spieth is checking all the boxes and ranks top 10 in the field in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, Strokes Gained: Approach and also number one in the field in Scrambling. The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups.
Jordan  ->  positive

-- Zach Turcotte  Luke List  The Arnold Palmer Invitational sets up to be another good spot for Luke List after quality fantasy performances in the Valspar Championship, Honda Classic, Genesis Open, Waste Management Phoenix Open and Farmers Insurance Open. Rating near the top in BOB% and Par-5 Scoring, List should do his fair share of scoring at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge. He also has shown decent upside in this event when his complete game is working, as evidenced by his T17 finish last year.
List  ->  positive

But, if you’re chasing that big GPP takedown…have some exposure. Player to Avoid:  Branden Grace $9,100 – Grace is a world class player that thrives on tough courses where scoring is a premium. Pebble does not fit that description.
Grace  ->  negative

He’s yet to make a splash in the playoffs over his career, but the change to a more scoreable course for the man ranked third in Birdie or Better Percentage is a good thing. Other golfers who may go overlooked due to price this week with great records at TPC Boston include Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100) and Russell Henley ($7,600). From a price perspective, J.J. Spaun ($6,700), David Lingmerth ($6,700) and Chad Campbell ($6,700) all should be on the radar here as min-price tournament plays too.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

2. Jason Dufner, $7,100  Dufner did book a 24th in 2012 and a 20th in 2013. But his last three trips to the Masters have resulted in MC, 49th, MC.
Dufner,  ->  negative

After receiving treatment at his Utah base, Tony commented how his ankle was recovering last week at TPC Louisiana where again he played really well in his partnership with fellow Utah-pro Daniel Summerhays. In the heat of Sunday they went backwards - hardly a surprise with Summerhays as a partner - but a total of 11 birdies and a single bogey across the Four-Ball element of the tournament highlighted that Finau is still very much in great form. For a power ball-striker it's his short game though which has really impressed me of late.
Finau  ->  positive

5th for Greens in Regulation and 4th for Strokes Gained Approach last week in Los Angeles, I think a motivated Justin will take all the stopping this week. RESULT: Winner  Brandt Snedeker 1.5pts EW 55/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds): - read our Betfair golf betting review here . Brandt Snedeker fits the bill pretty perfectly.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Key Stats for the Sony Open at Waialae Strokes Gained: Off the Tee Strokes Gained: Approach Birdie or Better Rate Driving Distance Par 5 Scoring    For more on why these are the key stats this week, check out our course primer. Best of the Best  Jordan Spieth (FanDuel Price: $12,800 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) and Justin Thomas ($12,600 | 8) - The pair of pals are in a tier of their own this week, as nobody else has win odds better than 14/1, and just four golfers in total have odds better than 20/1. Spieth didn't pack his putter last week and lost 3.7 strokes on the green, per FantasyGolfMetrics.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

In 2017 he ranked 15th in par-four scoring, 17th in three-putt avoidance and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green. Pat Perez - $14,500    Much like Leishman, Perez is another veteran coming off a career year in 2017 after winning the CIMB Classic to go along with six total top-10s. The 41-year-old finished T3 at this past year’s Tournament of Champions, while he’s posted no finish worse than a T34 in his last nine starts.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014. RESULT: T5  Kelly Kraft 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Kelly Kraft is another I like on the basis that he's been showing some decent enough form which hasn't scared the odds compilers too much and has a nice habit of late of playing well in the wind.
Kelly Kraft  ->  positive

It's also encouraging that both McGirt and Lingmerth had finished in the top 10 at the Honda Classic - another event on a Nicklaus course - prior to winning here. Horschel was fourth there in the spring and eighth, alongside McGirt, in 2016. Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here.
Horschel  ->  positive

Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jordan Spieth – $11,000  Even after Spieth’s second place finish last week at the Dean and Deluca, he only has 14 tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to Rahm who has 34. Rahm will soak up so much of Spieth’s ownership, along with the other top names in the field, it is possible we could see a sub 10% number on Spieth.
Spieth  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with 5 players this week as follows;  RICKIE FOWLER – 14-1 – 2pts Win FINISHED 11th  Whilst off course strong cases can be made for Rahm, Matsuyama and the other market leaders of those heading up the betting I like Rickie the most at the price. As much as Fowler has shown a dislike for Torrey Pines over recent years he has very much shown a liking for TPC Scottsdale and he undoubtedly has unfinished business here following his agonising loss in a play off to Hideki a couple of years ago. Take away the missed cut last week and Rickie has been in fantastic form since the back end of 2017.
RICKIE FOWLER  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
Tony Finau  ->  negative

Charley Hoffman - You can find Charley Hoffman with odds of +2500, which is a steal given his history at the Valero Texas Open. Hoffman not only won this event last year, but he had a top-five finish in 2013 and was a runner-up in 2011. Overall, Hoffman has three top-25 finishes in his last four events played and that includes a runner-up finish at the Arnold Palmer.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Looking back through the records, Fowler (T28), Rahm (T2) and Scott (T37) are well placed in the Par 4 scoring category so I'm confident our three picks can make a big mark and follow up Kevin Kisner's 30/1 success in last week's column. Finau is T6 in Par 4 Scoring which is a good pointer at this venue. Tony Finau deserves respect too after finishes of T11 and T8 in his two knocks here.
Fowler  ->  positive

Top Current Form Targets  Henrik Stenson  World Golf Ranking (#14)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($7,800)  FanDuel ($10,700)    Both of the players I mentioned above would be leading candidates for the form section as well with both coming off wins in their last stroke play event so instead, I will turn my attention to a phenomenal value on DraftKings this week. Stenson finished 8th at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Champions followed by a T6 at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic to kick off his 2018 schedule on the European Tour. He then came over to the PGA Tour and struggled in his first start missing the cut at the Valspar Championship but has since found some excellent form with a 4th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and a T6 in last week's Houston Open.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field. Outside of the obvious names, Hadwin has been one of the better players on The Tour this season, sitting in 5th place in The FedEx Cup standings, making 10/11 cuts total, 7/7 in the new year, including a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge, a 6th at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, and an excellent win at The Valspar Championship. His stats are also very impressive so far this season, ranking 34th in strokes gained tee to green, 27th in strokes gained approaching the green, 7th in strokes gained putting, 44th in GIR percentage (70.1%), 72nd in driving distance (293.6 yards), 34th in par five scoring, 18th in birdie or better percentage, and 1st in bogey avoidance.
Hadwin  ->  positive

What was encouraging at Torrey Pines is in addition to his normal tee to green strengths Harris actually topped the scrambling stats for the week and if he can keep these numbers going whilst getting one or two more putts to drop another big finish is on the cards. Finally further encouragement is given in English’s recent record at TPC Scottsdale which includes two top 10s in the past 4yrs. SCOTT PIERCY – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  Unsurprisingly for a man who spent his college days at UNLV Piercy is something of a desert golf specialist and any time he comes in to a desert event in any kind of form he is one for the short list.
English’s  ->  positive

Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix. Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights.
Taylor  ->  positive

2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
Johnson,  ->  negative

There was further promise in his sole subsequent appearance and since then he’s become a PGA Tour winner of sorts, taking the revamped Zurich Classic alongside team-mate Jonas Blixt. Smith will of course want to validate that success with one on his own and to that end encouragement can be found in Europe, where Lucas Bjerregaard took the GolfSixes with a partner but bettered that effort to land the Portugal Masters recently. I don’t imagine Smith has been paying too much attention to all that, but it is evidence that success breeds success and anyone who stuck with the Zurich long enough will know that his contribution was impressive under pressure.
Smith  ->  positive

All of his form points to Wailaie being ideal, one way or another. For instance he's lost play-offs in both the OHL Classic and the Honda, he's shot a round of 59 on the Web.com Tour, and his victory at that level came in 25-under, in an event also won by former Sony Open champion Russell Henley, while runner-up when he won the Travelers was Sony specialist Jerry Kelly and second to him in China was Kisner. "I love this course," he said last year and Knox, who attended college in Jacksonville, is worth a speculative each-way bet at what could look an extremely generous price.
Kisner.  ->  positive

Per FantasyGolfMetrics, DJ ranks 4th in strokes gained: tee to green and 1st off the tee over the past 12 weeks. Jordan Spieth ($12,000 | 12) - Spieth bounced back from a missed cut two weeks ago to finish 20th at Pebble Beach last week. At Riviera, Spieth's past four include three top 25s (12th, 4th, 22nd) and a missed cut in 2016.
Spieth  ->  positive

5th in 2012 and 4th in 2013, Simpson has always been a prime performer on Par 70 formats and it's noticeable that Webb is hitting fairways and intriguingly putting brilliantly right now. 2nd and 7th across my 10-week Driving Accuracy and Putting Average tracker, Simpson might surprise this week on a course where patience is a key. RESULT: T13  Watch these tips on YouTube with Steve Bamford: Golf Betting System YouTube Channel
Simpson  ->  positive

The man from Florida should be happy to see the putting surfaces at Quail Hollow changed to the Bermuda he grew up on and, interestingly, it was his performances on the old Bentgrass ones here that held him back. Yes, Berger has had two previous looks at Quail Hollow and shown up well with T28 on debut in 2015 and T17 in 2016. He was outside the top 50 in putts per rounds on both occasions (also 41st and 51st in putting average) so the switch to Bermuda could be the missing piece in the jigsaw for him to really thrive there.
Berger  ->  positive

He made the cut in the first two events of the season and, significantly, ranked sixth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee last week and eighth in Driving Distance — an area of his game which has hampered him in the past. English has a great record at Torrey Pines, having never missed a cut here in five starts and has recorded finishes of T14-T31-T2 over his last three appearances here. He’s also one of the better poa annua putters on tour (+1.33 Strokes Gained: Putting on poa/Bentgrass over his career — via fantasygolfmetrics.com) and comes in rather cheap at $7,400.
English  ->  positive

Given a large number of those ahead of him in the betting will be using this as a warm up as opposed to going for the win, Henley arguably looks one of, if not the most obvious winner this week. Thomas Pieters 55/1 (MarathonBet, UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Whilst not in the finest form at the moment, Pieters looks an intriguing prospect on a course that he should be able to take advantage of. Pieters’ biggest strength is his length off the tee, but he is also a streaky putter and if he can find his touch on the greens, this test should suit.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season. He was 7th here last season, which is one of four top 17 finishes over the years, whilst Moore has a best of 4th in 2012 but otherwise has pretty ordinary form with just one other finish inside the top 35 in eight tries at the course.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

When the latter dips, he can't really compete so it's been encouraging to see an upturn recently, ranking seventh and eighth in strokes-gained: tee-to-green and inside the top-10 for greens hit in both the Farmers (12th) and Phoenix (26th). Luke List should go well at a big price  List showed up well here on his debut two years ago, sitting second after round one and seventh at halfway only for a third-round 75 to see him fall all the way down to 50th. To his credit, he responded with a best-of-the-day 67 to climb to 20th and with last year's 72-72 seeing him just miss out on the weekend, there's plenty of encouragement when it comes to his course record.
Luke List  ->  positive

After being knocked out of the Matchplay early, that could work to his advantage here. Rafa Cabrera Bello 33/1  RCB has been steady as they come recently and arrives to Houston in good form. He was knocked out of the matchplay early last week so he has had plenty of time to get his game right here.
Cabrera Bello  ->  positive

Tier 3 Values    Kevin Kisner - $8,400 (25-1)    Kisner finished ninth in his one and only trip to Kapalua back in 2016. He was well behind Spieth's runaway total, but he did finish second in the field in proximity and third in strokes gained putting. And, like Harman, Kisner was in contention throughout at Erin Hills.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Brendan Steele - $15,000    The 2011 Texas Open champion has finished top-15 in four of seven appearances at the event, while he currently ranks fifth in SG: OTT, eighth in GIR percentage, eighth in birdie average and 15th in SG: T2G. Steele missed his first cut of the entire season during his previous start at the Masters, but he remains inside of the top-15 in the FedExCup standings thanks to six top-20s and a win already this season. Glue Guys    Zach Johnson - $14,500    Johnson won the event twice before its relocation to TPC San Antonio in 2010, but he’s posted a trio of top-30s at this venue throughout the past four years.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

For starters, as mentioned more than once of late, he's playing really well. Horschel was fourth at the Honda, despite a closing bogey, and put a blip at the Valspar behind him by finishing 13th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last time out. On both occasions it was Horschel's customarily reliable long-game which provided the foundation, but there was also definite improvement around the greens at Bay Hill, where he ranked second for scrambling and 16th in strokes-gained putting.
Horschel  ->  positive

Fowler is looking to get his second win of the year and reclaim a top 5 ranking in the world.

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

Cheeson Hadley and Trey Mullinax have both won the Web.com Tour's Rex Hospital Open in Raleigh (about an hour away) and both rank fairly highly for Greens In Regulation. Hadley, who lives in Raleigh, has been in fair form this year - he won on the Web.com Tour last month and he was third last week so he could go well and Mullinax is ranked 132nd in the FedEx Cup Standings so that could be a pointer. He also finished inside the top-ten at the US Open in June so he has plenty of game.
Hadley  ->  positive

While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts. Statistically, Chappell also seems to suit the TPC San Antonio course well as he ranks inside the top-40 in both Driving Distance and par 5 scoring, even after his poor start to the year. To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68.
Chappell  ->  positive

The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1. How Erin Hills is going to play this week is a bit of an unknown.
Day  ->  positive

At his value price on both sites, he is another golfer I will be targeting in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#5)  Vegas Odds (10/1)  Draftkings ($11,400)  FanDuel ($12,600)    After finishing with a Top 10 at last years Tour Championship, Justin Rose sat at #13 in the world coming into this season. Since then he has picked up three wins on three different tours(HSBC Champions, Turkish Airlines Open, Indonesian Masters) and six other Top 10 finishes including back to back Top 5's coming into this week.
Vegas  ->  positive

I could see the case for fading Finau in tournaments with a very high projected ownership but at a price under $8K and a profile that matches the course, I find it very hard this week. Matt Kuchar  World Golf Ranking (#18)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,400)  FanDuel ($9,500)    Kuchar leads the way this week of all players who have played here more than twice in their career. He has made the trip to Muirfield 11 times, making 10 cuts and picking up six Top 10 finishes including a WIN back in 2013.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

The PGA Tour returns to Florida for this week's Valspar Championship and Dave Tindall has three bets for the showdown at Innisbrook Resort...  "A Florida course which calls for strong iron play is right up Stenson's street." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Henrik Stenson EW @ 18/1  This has been a good event for overseas players and it could be time for Henrik Stenson to become the second Swede to get his name on the trophy after Carl Pettersson in 2005. A Florida course which calls for strong iron play is right up Stenson's street and three starts at Copperhead show 7-11-4.
Stenson's  ->  positive

Brian Gay ($5,700) – This is a true boom or bust play. Gay is hugely accurate and a fantastic putter, and at aged 44 could be inspired by last week’s winner Rod Pampling. He has actually won on the course back in 2008 when he eclipsed the field.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

Poulter has made the cut on all six visits to Harbour Town, while for a brief time in the 2012 PGA Championship at Kiawah Island it looked like he might lay down a stern challenge to Rory McIlroy. That formline is given greater substance by the exploits of Carl Pettersson, a former Heritage champion who was right in the mix on Sunday at the aforementioned PGA, and I'm in no doubt that this particular venue plays to Poulter's strengths. He's fallen off the face of the earth following an injury setback which ruled him out of much of last season, including the Ryder Cup, but his performances since have been packed with promise, only to be undermined by all too frequent mistakes.
Poulter's  ->  positive

Daniel Berger is tournament favourite and might be a dual winner already in 2017 but for Spieth performing his party trick again from a bunker at the Travelers Championship last month. Kevin Kisner and Kyle Stanley are also recent winners who figure prominently but I am going to delve a little deeper and go for Hilton Head hero Wesley Bryan, who is quite an attractive 80/1 chance. It was a pretty tense old finish at the RBC Heritage but Bryan displayed plenty of bottle over the closing holes to pip course specialist Luke Donald by a shot and get off the mark on the PGA Tour.
Bryan,  ->  positive

Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
Brown  ->  negative

CareerBuilder Challenge  La Quinta, California  PGA West Stadium Course - Par 72 - 7,113 yards  PGA West Nicklaus Tournament Course - Par 72 - 7,204 yards  La Quinta Country Club - Par 72 - 7,060 yards  Field - 156 entrants  Purse - $5.9M    The Preview    Formerly labeled the Bob Hope Classic, this week’s CareerBuilder Challenge in La Quinta, California is the first leg of the West Coast Swing following the PGA Tour’s two-week stint in Hawaii. A weak field includes just one player inside the top-15 of the Official World Golf Ranking (Jon Rahm), while other big names include the red-hot Brian Harman, Patrick Reed, Kevin Kisner and Phil Mickelson to name a few. The distinct pro-am format features three rounds at three separate venues for all 156 entrants before a 54-hole cut, when the top-70 and ties will head back to the PGA West Stadium Course for Sunday’s final round.
(Jon Rahm),  ->  positive

That kind of form should continue this week on another course Pat has typically fared well on with four top 10 finishes in this event. Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category.
Perez  ->  positive

At 90/1 I am happy to chance that Cauley can find some of his early-season form at what is somewhat of a home event for the Floridian and contend here. Billy Horschel 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds or Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w  Billy Horschel has finished 4th and 8th on his last two starts in this event, following a spell which saw him miss three of his first four cuts in this event. Whatever it is that Horschel has found at this event over the last couple of years clearly works and I am happy to chance a repeat performance of last year, at long odds.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

The course ended up playing substantially easier – particularly on Thursday/Friday – than in years past, which was a bit of a surprise to those of us who expected a more grindy affair.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin - Adam Hadwin has been on fire for much of the season and is coming off his seventh top-25 finish at the RBC Heritage. Hadwin has now made the cut in 12 of his last 13 events and is ranked sixth in sand save percentage, 20th in birdie average and 16th in scoring average. Hadwin has the game to succeed on this course as well and in a weaker field, he’s guaranteed to in the thick of things until the final few holes.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.
Spieth,  ->  positive

His recent stats will look good, but in my mind, he’s trending down. Bill Haas ($9,500) – Haas is probably my favorite DFS play of the high-end studs this week. He started the year off in great form, fell off a bit when he and his wife welcomed a baby girl and had since snapped out of that slump.
Haas  ->  positive

What is most impressive about Henley’s record this year might be his performance in the years first two majors as he recorded his best ever finish at Augusta with a T11 and was in contention at the U.S. Open until a subpar final round. While he doesn’t have an extensive Open record, Henley has tended to play well on wind-exposed courses before (he has wins in Hawaii and Florida) and did record a top-20 finish at the Open back in 2015 at the Old-Course. He also currently ranks 17th in Par-4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards, a stat which may translate well to success on Birkdale’s tougher par 4s.
Henley’s  ->  positive

FANTASY  Sleepers: WGC Bridgestone Invitational  Swing Vision Zach Johnson's slo-mo swing is analyzed at John Deere  Zach Johnson … It's probably cheating to circle a 12-time PGA TOUR winner with two majors as a Sleeper, but if we're staying true to the model that he goes as his putter goes, this is an oddly adequate position for him. He's acknowledged that he knows that the reason he hasn't made more noise this year is due to inconsistent putting, but the familiar greens at TPC Deere Run proved reliable en route to a share of fifth place. He validated with a T14 at Royal Birkdale and now gets Firestone where he's rung up four top 10s among nine top 25s in 13 appearances.
Zach Johnson's  ->  positive

Plus, his experience in Europe should be of assistance if the wind picks up. Charley Hoffman  Hoffman has gained the most strokes at this event over the past five years (45.07) — seven more than second-place Ryan Palmer. His results include a win and three other Top-11 finishes.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Oh, it's a par 70 as well so his third place in Par 4 Scoring Average adds to the mix. Also T13 and T17 in the last two editions of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Harman was T8 in the 2015 Players Championship so has a decent bank of Florida form under his belt. A strong player in the wind (he led and then finished third in the 2018 opener in Hawaii in very gusty conditions), Harman seems to fit the bill in so many ways this week and the 45/1 looks real each-way value.
Harman  ->  positive

With a ninth place finish at this event from last season to build on, Casey looks poised for a big week. I’m going out on a limb and saying Casey not only produces for DFS here but lands his second PGA Tour win as well. MY SLEEPER : Harris English ($6,700)  English got off to a rough start in 2017 but may have found his groove somewhat last week.
Casey  ->  positive

Lashley ranked third in scrambling on the Web.com Tour in 2017 and is currently 29th at the next nevel in SG: Around-the-Green, 10th in putting from 4-8 feet and 37th in putting from inside 10 feet. Nate Lashley - $11,800    The rookie followed up a T28 at the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship with a T18 at the Houston Open -- his best career finish on the PGA Tour. He made the cut during his Texas Open debut in 2016 and owns five top-25s this season.
Nate Lashley  ->  positive

On just price alone, he looks good value at 40/1 but the course also plays to his strengths, so I really did not want to leave him out this week, with a return to form likely immanent. Abraham Ancer 125/1 (Betfair/Paddypower and Boyleports 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Despite being raised in Mexico, Abraham Ancer was born in Texas and currently resides in San Antonio, and he will look to carry his trending form over as he plays at “home” for the second straight event. In his last three starts, Ancer has finished T16 (Valspar), T13 (Corales) and T8 (Houston) and should he keep this form up he may well contend for his second win as a professional and first on the PGA Tour.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

With this in mind, it is worth rolling with him until his form dips, especially at a course he has played well at before. Koepka was the only player at Firestone in 2015 to post four sub-70 rounds over the week and although he didn’t quite go low enough to really threaten Lowry it is clear he liked his first look at the course. The American has six top-10 finishes in his last thirteen major starts including a win and four top-6’s and whilst he has yet to make a real impact at the WGC events, beyond his 6th here in 2015, it is worth chancing that he is going to ride this clearly massive wave of confidence right now in another strong-field event.
Koepka  ->  positive

Statswise Day ranks third in driving distance, 27th in GIR, 25th in SGP, sixth in SG of the tee and second in par 4 scoring. After winning on the poa annua greens of Torrey Pines a couple of weeks ago along with his excellent record here, Day looks a good shout here at 10’s. Patrick Reed 33/1  Patrick Reed looks to be trending in the right direction lately and could be a player to keep on side this week.
Day  ->  positive

The Italian Stallion comes in at 4th in SG: Approach, 34th in SG: Off the Tee, 14th in Par 5 Scoring, and 23rd in Birdie or Better %. Lucas Glover ($13,900) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact.
Glover  ->  positive

The main areas of focus here are previous form/current form, driving distance and accuracy, GIR, SGP, par 4 scoring and par 5 scoring. Marc Leishman 18/1  The Aussie came close to his third win in 12 months last weekend at the CJ Cup in Korea. He fired rounds of 66,72,71,70 getting into a playoff with FedExCup Champion Justin Thomas and ended up losing the second playoff hole and finishing second.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

It may also be worth looking at players who have played well on other similar seaside courses such as Waialae Country Club, host of the Sony Open in Hawaii and Harbour Town Golf Links which hosts the RBC Heritage. Graeme McDowell won last year beating Jason Bohn and Russell Knox in a playoff. Gmac hit an absolutely superb second shot into the first playoff hole and made the birdie to seal victory.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

I'm drawn to his results on short course formats from Colonial onwards: 5th in Texas has been followed by 8th at TPC River Highlands, 3rd at Sedgefield, 6th at Glen Oaks and 9th at Conway Farms. At a tad over 7,200 yards at altitude, TPC Summerlin is perfect for Simpson who sits 2nd in my Driving Accuracy 10-week tracker and more tellingly 14th in the Putting Average (putts per GIR) tracker. 9th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green and 10th for Strokes Gained Putting at Sedgefield, 10th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green at Glen Oaks, plus 1st for Strokes Gained Putting on his last visit to pure Bentgrass greens at Conway Farms highlights a player in rather good nick.
Simpson  ->  positive

Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
JT,  ->  negative

Take 2016: despite a soft course, relatively receptive greens and tranquil conditions across the opening 3 days of play, only 3 players made it into double-digit under par numbers. 2017 saw plenty of rain hit the course on tournament Monday, but despite a soft course and receptive greens only winner Kevin Chappell and runner-up Brooks Koepka made it to double-digits under par. A mixture of course length, intimidating tee shots, all manner of off-fairway hazards and tough, undulating green complexes make the course a technical beast.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Had Harman have just shot level par on the opening day (he broke par in each of the last three rounds), he would have finish in a tie for 2nd. It was a similar story in 2016, when Harman finished T17, as Harman finished two shots shy of the three players who were tied for 9th. This time around though, he had no horrific rounds, he was just steady all week long (69-71-70-70).
Harman  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Cameron Tringale ($6,700)  Tringale is a hard player to get right, but he always brings upside for DFS. Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead.
Tringale  ->  positive

It takes a special player to have that belief, as only the world’s elite fill you with that confidence, but he is definitely amongst that list, even without that major title. Statistically Fowler ranks 49th in Strokes Gained Off-The-Tee and 14th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green which are two of the key areas this week. Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th).
Fowler  ->  positive

His game sets up well again this week and should be a consideration for tournament contests. -- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons.
Kirk  ->  positive

One of those victories came at the Utah Championship and he finished the season 8th for Greens in Regulation, 1st for Birdie Average, 1st for Scoring Average, 5th for Scrambling, 1st for Putting Average and 2nd for All-Round. Kizzire then hit the PGA Tour hard finishing 2nd here at TPC Summerlin and 4th at the CC of Jackson. Since then 8th at Torrey Pines (the 40+mph wind Sunday renewal!
Kizzire  ->  positive

Harris English – GPP – DK: $7000 FD: $7100  I will not be going anywhere near English in cash games but I do think he makes a great play to round out GPP lineups. English has recovered from his midseason missed cut stretch with 4/5 straight made cuts. Looking at his Vegas odds English stands out in his price range and I think he does without a crazy high level of ownership.
English  ->  positive

With enough experience at Augusta under his belt now, Ryan knows the track pretty much as well as anyone in the field and I believe the time has now come for him to move his game on to another level. RUSSELL HENLEY – 125-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 15th  As we have seen from Henley in his years on the tour he is not someone who wins two or three times a year but, when his game is on and he is in the hunt he is not afraid to mix it with the best and beat them. The Georgia native showed this in literally his first start on the PGA Tour as a fully fledged member when he spread eagled the field at the Sony Open to win with a score of -24.
Henley  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

If he can keep the ball in short grass off the tee, Pieters looks good value to have a good week here. Branden Grace 40/1  The South African has been coming into some good form lately and has proven himself to be a great wind player. He finished T27 at The Masters at the end of April and followed that with a T11 at the RBC Heritage, a T10 in Texas and a respectable T24 in New Orleans.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

A player with major pedigree as good as Louis’ should always be considered and he will no doubt be ready for another big week at Augusta at what I consider a very fair price. J.B. Holmes 125/1 (Betfair 1-6 1/5 odds) or 90/1 Skybet (1-8 1/4 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  J.B. Holmes made 2/4 cuts in the majors last year, but when he did make the weekend he finished T4 at the Masters and a distant 3rd at the Open Championship. His T4 here last year came on his third start at Augusta, finishing 25th on debut in 2008 before missing the cut in 2015.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years.
Poulter,  ->  positive

He's certainly worth looking at for that event next week but don't miss out on him here. It's a tough front end of the market but there's five each-way places to go at and Kisner is certainly capable of hanging tough with the big guns if the putts drop. He finished 20th for Strokes Gained: Putting last season and third in 2016 so he's been one of the best around with the short-stick in recent years and that's a key asset on this course.
Kisner  ->  positive

Tie that in with the aforementioned 5th at Harbour Town where he finished well in the worst of the Sunday conditions and Webb clearly has momentum. 21st here in 2011, 4th in 2012 and 2nd in 2015 on his home course, Simpson also finished a half-decent 33rd here at the PGA Championship after shooting a +5/76 to take himself right out of it on Thursday before producing -2/211 across his final 54 holes. All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays.
Simpson  ->  positive

Not bad.

Spieth/Norlander/Phil/Simpson  ->  positive

Haas has played Firestone seven times over his career, and he has two finishes inside the top 20, with his career best being a T7 back in 2013. It’s worth noting, however, that Haas does seem to set up well for the course based on his season-long stats which include ranking sixth in Par 4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards and also being inside the top-10 in Bogey Avoidance. While he may not be a huge threat to win, Haas’s record at big events this year, and his solid statistical ranks, means he is definitely capable of a big week here and deserves consideration as a nice value on DraftKings this week given his meager salary.
Haas  ->  positive

6 of the last 9 winners have been in the top-7 for fairways hit, but high Greens in Regulation numbers are even more important as 4 of the last 7 winners were in the top 2 across GIR% category on their way to victory. Comfortable Bermudagrass putters Jordan Spieth and Bill Haas were the outlying Greens in Regulation performers of recent winners, finishing 9th and 11th in that category respectively. Since the 2008 Rees Jones re-design, Henrik Stenson holds the tournament winning lowest total with -13/267 in an event that featured softened greens on the Sunday.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Dustin Johnson – $12,200  Talking about the top player in the world in an extremely weak field, how original. Let’s just say that people are worried about Dustin Johnson’s game and his long trip over from Royal Birkdale to play in an event he probably could care less about.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Fowler also happens to be a great putter, but great putting has not been a requirement for winning at PGA National. That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance."
Fowler  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Eagle Point was a windy affair with technical level scoring where Perez excelled and the Scottsdale, Arizona resident also shot an impressive -7/65 in the 3rd Round at TPC Sawgrass when the wind was at its strongest. At a career high 40th in the OWGR, Perez has always been comfortable here at the classical Colonial with 4th in 2007, 6th in 2008, 10th in 2010, and 5th on his last outing here in 2015. He's also finished in the top 10 at every PGA Tour Texas venue which again highlights a player who performs well in windy conditions.
Perez  ->  positive

He won by masterfully playing the angles of the course, not to mention leading the field in strokes gained putting and finishing third in both scrambling and proximity to the hole (the greens are enormous, and simply doing well at GIR won't cut it). Reed was not even in the top-15 in SGP, but he was second in scrambling. So while it rarely hurts to hit it far off the tee -- which is why we tab driving distance as a key stat this week -- you'll be best served by focusing on short-game skill and putting.
Reed  ->  positive

Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
Mickelson  ->  negative

The latter three are all outside the top 120 in the world rankings, so if they can....    Oosthuizen didn't have his best stuff at the Masters (T41) but had been in decent nick before that while Grace has improved from T27 at Augusta National to T11 at The Heritage (like this, a Pete Dye track) before T10 in last week's Texas Open. In fact, Futureoffantasy.com's list of top 25 performers on Pete Dye courses shows Grace ranked 8th while he's third in the table measuring his Pete Dye numbers against Expected Strokes Gained elsewhere. It's Bermuda greens at TPC Louisiana and Oosthuizen performs relatively better on such surfaces than he does on other grass types.
Grace  ->  positive

Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

It means he's 26-under for his last five rounds at Kapalua." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 5 places  Main Bet: Back Rickie Fowler e.w. @ 7/1  Being an American with a sharp and imaginative short game certainly seems to be the common thread when looking at past winners of the calendar year-opening Sentry Tournament of Champions.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

If he can keep it up – and he’s shown no signs of stopping – he’s easily one of the best values on the board this week. BARGAIN BIN  Bill Haas ($6,900) – In this range, you have to take what you can get, and I’ll gladly take the experience and track record of Bill Haas. Forget the British – it’s completely irrelevant here, and Haas has been pretty outstanding otherwise, including some rather strong finishes at this event over the past five years.
Haas  ->  positive

But I'm more than happy to go into battle with Simpson, Kisner and Schniederjans. Jason Dufner showed up well last week when perhaps not expected to and this is a more suitable test for him (T9 two years ago). Charles Howell, who has a ridiculous amount of good finishes here (seven top fives and lots of other top 15s) is certainly a candidate for a Top 5 while Zach Johnson loves this place and is a former winner.
Kisner  ->  positive

Villegas does have some fairly recent form, finishing runner-up at Sea Island in his final 2016 event, and was only beaten eight shots in the Phoenix on his penultimate start. As with McGirt, the plan is to place two lay orders, for 12 units at [15.0] and 20 units at [3.0], to secure an overall profit should either hit just the first target. Back Martin Flores (w/o Scott/Fowler/Garcia) 1u ew @ 110/1  Back Martin Flores for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ 5/1  Rather than another back-to-lay, the final pick is preferred as an each-way selection in our speciality market excluding the top-three contenders - Adam Scott, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia.
McGirt,  ->  positive

Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week. Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event. It wasn’t to be for Rose that week though as he limped to a disappointing 48th place finish, much below his usual high standards.
Rose  ->  positive

Going back to the fall swing season, Stanley has only missed two cuts (Honda and OHL Classic), and has been one of the best on Tour in terms of tee-to-green (5th) and Bogey Avoidance (12th). Where Stanley has struggled immensely is with the flatstick in hand, ranking 165th in SG: Putting, but he’s elite in almost every other factor on the way to the green. He’s hit the 2nd-most greens in regulation (73.08%), sits 5th in Proximity to the Hole, and 6th in overall SG: Approach.
Stanley  ->  positive

Jason Sobel -- Alex Cejka ($8,300)  From Ryan Moore to Charley Hoffman to Scott Piercy, there are a handful of Vegas residents in this week's field, but my pick is the guy who was part of the runner-up logjam at this event last year. Cejka had a decent finish at the CIMB Classic two weeks ago and he should be accustomed to desert golf. On a week when just finishing Low Vegas Resident is an accomplishment, I like Cejka to take it.
Alex Cejka  ->  positive

He seems to have more experience this time around and could be another man to watch here. Luke List 50/1  List opened with a respectable T26 at the Safeway Open and followed that with five top 15’s in a row which started with a T2 at The Sanderson Farms Championship. He had another good week at the Shriners Open in Vegas finishing T15 which included a final round 64 and finished T7 the following week at the OHL Classic.
Luke List  ->  positive

22nd at the PGA Championship was his first Major as a professional and it's worth remembering that a 1st Round 68 was good enough for 3rd place, which he backed up with a 69 in the 3rd Round, seeing him in 6th spot after 54 holes. 68-67-68 on his debut at TPC Boston saw Murray again in the very heat of the battle come Sunday, mixing it with Thomas, Spieth, Leishman and Rahm, before a final round collapse to 25th. Undoubtedly he's not the finished article, but at an event this week which is low-key and with a game where he's hitting plenty of greens and putting superbly, I could see the power-hitting World Number 93 in the mix in California.
Rahm,  ->  positive

Henley’s form this year has been a little patchy however he seemed to click at just the right time when he closed with a 65 yesterday in Houston to finish in 8th place. So we’ve established Henley is running in to form at the right time however what makes him really jump of the page this week is his progressive form figures at Augusta. In four starts in The Masters Russell has gone MC, 31, 21, 11.
Russell  ->  positive

He’s averaged 4.30 birdies on the Tour this year, has an overall birdie or better% of 24.44%, and although he’s not incredible at avoiding bogeys, a large part of that is from his 3-putting numbers. Beyond those 3-putt numbers, Pieters has been a stud on greens this year – if he had enough tracked rounds, he’d currently rank 16th in SG: Putting. He struggles on longer putts but has been nails inside 10’ (90.87%), so with his approach game he’ll give himself some birdie opportunities on the greens.
Pieters  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Daniel Berger ($11,300) – Part of me is disturbed by the idea of paying this much for Berger, but when there isn’t too much trouble for him on the track, he can absolutely run over the field with his superb T2G play and plus putter. If you’re going to pay up, I think this is the way to go.
Berger  ->  positive

From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th). Finau also ranks 21st in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green and whilst he has seemingly struggled on the 450-500 yard Par 4’s (78th), I am confident he can post another strong finish around this track. At 50/1 you are getting a player in good form, with quality course form to boot.
Finau  ->  positive

He will be one of our highest owned guys this week across all DraftKings contests. Best bargain basement option:  Seamus Power $6,800 – Seamus is a Web.com Tour grad from last season that is quietly having quite the first year on the PGA Tour with 12/16 cuts made. He’s yet to find a T10, but is trending in the right direction with a T25 at the John Deere Classic and a T18 at The Barbasol Championship.
Seamus  ->  positive

I will be using Casey in both formats. Charley Hoffman ($7,900): Although Hoffman came back to life at the PGA, he remains a solid play again this week at this price. Hoffman ranks 5th in Par 4 Scoring, 6th in SG: Putting, 13th in BoB% and 15th in SG: T2G.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Other: Alex Noren (11th ranked player in the world, won at altitude last year)  High Upside Tournament Picks  Jason Dufner ($8,100): Coming off a decent week and his best finish on the year (14th) Dufner is the type of player I want to target this week as he’s great at finding the fairway with driver—11th in accuracy this year. Dufner’s had success at similar styled venues to this week as well and at $8,100 his price should drive people off him. Byeong-Hun An ($7,500): Great young player who took down a strong field in 2015 on another tree-lined venue at Wentworth.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Rory’s history at the Masters would be incomplete without mentioning 2011: Despite leading the tournament after each one of the first three rounds — and by four shots to start the final round — Mcllroy shot a Masters-worst 80 in the final round, finishing T15. Vegas Odds  Rory hasn’t been anything special with double-digit odds to win:  Of his 26 tournaments with at least 10 percent odds, McIlroy has posted 100 DraftKings points or more in nine and failed to meet his salary-based expectations in 12. And his ownership in these events has been high.
Rory  ->  positive

[Writer’s Note: #MyEditorThoughtThisSpotWasReservedForHumbleBragging] [Editor’s Note: Only editors get to make notes.] Humpnostication Prognostication  If I were a skill game proposition guy, I would put my Coors Lite on Adam Scott ($10,300). He won here in 2005 and has been the runner-up at Rivera twice, including last year.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

I am willing to overlook his previous course form here, as I believe like others before him, he can put the past in his rear-view mirror on this course and get himself into contention for win number one. Chesson Hadley 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds) & 100/1 (Skybet 8 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Chesson Hadley is the one player who really jumps out at me this week and I was pleased to see he was three-figures. He had a very strong start to the season and has petered up and down in form since, with a missed cut last time out ensuring longer odds on him this week.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

As mentioned, Lingmerth’s first Tour win came over at the Memorial Tournament, an event hosted by Jack Nicklaus, and I think the prospects of a legends-of-the-game double are considerably higher than the odds imply. The next man on my list is the one Lingmerth got the better of for his sole success to date – and that’s Justin Rose. Truth be told, I’d already settled on the headline selection before reading what Rose had to say about a potential link between this event and the one at Muirfield Village: “It reminds me of the Memorial which happens to be Jack’s tournament.”  While the two layouts may not look similar on TV, there are certain leaderboard ties between them and while links are often there if you really want to find them, in this instance they come via the likes of Every (6th at Muirfield Village), Mark Wilson and Matt Jones.
Rose.  ->  positive

Don’t overthink it, just back him knowing he’s good value until he eventually has a bad week. Brian Harman 150/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  Brian Harman is enjoying a good season so far on the PGA Tour and thru nine events has only missed two cuts. One of those missed cuts came in the season-opener, the Safeway Open in October and the other at the RSM Classic in November.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Thomas has taken a little bit longer to find his stride compared to the dual major winner but his time has arrived to join the absolute elite of the game after a golden couple of months around the turn of the year hoisted him up to number 10 in the world rankings. A successful defence of his title at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia was followed by successive victories in Hawaii (with a 59 while playing with Spieth thrown in along the way) and pinpointed Thomas as a player who is going to win at regular intervals. A resident now in Florida, the Stadium Course really gets his juices flowing and he could not be more glowing in his praise for the layout.
Thomas  ->  positive

I won't be using him on FanDuel at his price but on DraftKings I think he makes an excellent target in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Luke List  World Golf Ranking (#53)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($10,900)    Since missing three straight earlier in the season, Luke List has been playing some terrific golf and tops the form list week both from an average finish and DraftKings scoring standpoint. He has made eight straight cuts with no finish worse than a T26 with three Top 10's and over his last five events, leads all players in the field with an average of 85.8 DraftKings points per event.
Luke List  ->  positive

Furyk, for instance, should have won both; Webb Simpson has lost a play-off for both; Chris Kirk and Heath Slocum have won the RSM and contended for the RBC, just like Kisner. Given that the RSM Classic remains in its infancy, the ties between leaderboards have been established rapidly and Kisner can become the first man to win both having recaptured his best form this year, including when going down by a single stroke in the Arnold Palmer Invitational last month. I thought he was unlucky at Bay Hill, even if as a backer at 66/1 I'd love to blame him for everything that went wrong.
Kisner.  ->  positive

More recently, he demonstrated a different quality in producing Saturday fireworks to open up a four-shot lead in the Honda Classic, before defying a difficult start to the final round as he ultimately won by the same margin in an important, confidence-boosting win, almost exactly a year since he lost a play-off for the Phoenix Open having appeared to be similarly in control. While far from being one of the most prestigious events on the calendar, Phoenix was very important to Fowler and defeat to Hideki Matsuyama in front of his friends and family hit him hard. In fact, I strongly suspect it had a lasting impact, enough to in part explain some of his disappointing performances in majors last year.
Fowler  ->  positive

However, we may start our lineups below Rahm if playing cash. Value Plays:  Brendan Steele $7,800 – The Steele Curtain may have one of our least favorite golf swings on the PGA Tour (seriously, watch his swing…so ugly), but you can’t argue it’s effectiveness. He’s a California guy who’s familiar putting on these Poa Annua putting surfaces.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  MY PICK : Martin Kaymer ($9,500)  Martin Kaymer hasn’t won since his victory at the U.S. Open in 2014, but he does have a great streak of 28 starts without a missed cut going and should generally be considered the class of a fairly weak field this week. While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence.
Martin Kaymer  ->  positive

George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (33rd)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($10,300)  FantasyAces ($5,800)  I start things off this week with what I feel will be a terrific GPP pivot, contrarian option. It feels like a very scary pick as Molinari hasn't played a professional round since late November but I am going to trust my cheatsheet this week where he sits in the #2 spot.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

According to FantasyNational, Spieth is seventh in the field in his past 24 rounds in strokes gained: approach among players in the field. There's no guarantee that Spieth hits fairways, but if the wind isn't problematic, he has the profile to dominate. Sergio Garcia ($9,400 | 18/1) - Garcia's odds have shortened from 20/1 as of Friday to 18/1, but his FanDuel price is locked in.
Spieth  ->  positive

Statswise he also ticks the boxes here ranking ninth in driving accuracy, fourth in GIR, eighth in SGP, third in par 4 scoring and 13th in par 5 scoring. Final selections –  Gary Woodland 1pt EW  Alex Noren 1pt EW  Tyrell Hatton 1pt EW  Brian Harman 1pt EW  Total staked = 8 pts  *Some bookies paying 7 places*  Good luck and enjoy the golf. Doublebogey6
Brian Harman  ->  positive

He ranks 15th in driving distance, first in SGP, 11th in SGTTG, fifth in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a near winner last week Day could go one better and win in style this week. Patrick Reed 25/1  The young American really stepped up to the plate last week and got the job done in Bethpage with a great win.
Day  ->  positive

As the day wore on the air appeared heavier and making birdies wasn't quite as easy as it had been when Holmes embarked on his final round. All the stars aligned for Holmes, as they had done for Jones 12 months earlier and in the fullness of time, these two results could well be viewed upon as freakish. Prior to 2014, Adam Scott in 2007, who benefited from a late Stuart Appleby collapse, had been the only winner not to be within two of the lead with a round to go and every winner bar Holmes has been inside the top-four places after 54 holes.
Holmes  ->  positive

As is the case for most of the guys in this write-up, List struggles with the putter but did gain 3.6 strokes on Waialae's greens a year ago, resulting in a 13th-place finish. Andrew Landry ($8,100 | 160) - Spending down on too many options probably isn't necessary this week when we need only six golfers, so don't go too heavy on the punt plays. But you can consider Landry, who finished fourth at the RSM in his most recent action.
Andrew Landry  ->  positive

When you weigh it all up its hard not to fancy Rickie’s chances here in Erin Hills. Jon Rahm 20/1  Big hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm has made quite an impact on the PGA Tour this season with a win and seven top 10’s under his belt so far. After shooting a final round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open in February, Rahm bagged his first PGA Tour win at previous US Open venue, Torrey Pines, finishing on 13 under par in total.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Jon Rahm ($9,600) – He’s just impossible to ignore. He might be getting to a price point where it’s hard to imagine paying up for him instead of someone with the pedigree of a Justin Rose (more below), but Rahm is one of those players who, when he plays well, isn’t just a great real-life player – he’s the perfect fantasy option. When he is hot, he is a birdie-making machine, as evidenced by his career birdie-or-better % that was better than the number Dustin Johnson put up last season.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Following the Shell Houston Open in Texas, Russell Henley booked the final spot in this year's opening major championship and nineteen rookies will drive down Magnolia Lane for the first time. It has been an exciting opening six months to the PGA Tour season with four first time winners securing invitations to The Masters.
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week. ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR.
NOREN  ->  positive

I think Haas falls into the middle of the pack ownership wise and I am comfortable being overweight on that number. If he can straighten out the drive Haas is a player I think sets up great for when winds pick up as he can stay in contention in the rough weather through his scrambling ability. Brian Harman – Play  I think Harman probably falls under Bello, Berger and Kisner in terms of ownership but still sees people on him.
Haas  ->  positive

He comes in 12th overall in my model this week due to his lower ranks in Par 4 Scoring(64th) and BoB%(47th) but ranks 13th in SG: OTT + APP which really draws my attention this week. Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Patton Kizzire, $10000 – Kizzire has made the cut both times in La Quinta, but his real appeal lies in his two wins already this season, his last coming in a marathon playoff with James Hahn last week. Though there may be some fatigue after a long week and long flight back to the U.S. Mainland, Kizzire should be good to make the cut and potentially get himself back into contention yet another week. Charles Howell III, $10000 – With four top-15s and eight cuts made in his last eight trips to the California desert, Howell is an ironclad pick to make the cut with potential for much more.
Kizzire,  ->  positive

As for his putting, it seems the switch to a TaylorMade Spider has had a very positive effect and, even last year, he was decent on these Las Colinas greens, finishing 18th in Putts Per Round. Kang is 24th in Par 4 Performance this year which is another good pointer and, on a course where you can go low, it's worth remembering that he shot a 60 at Monterey Peninsula in the second round of another AT&T event, the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The 29-year-old, who was T18 in last year's US Open, is 66/1 here and that looks too big when you consider how well he performs in windy Texas conditions.
Kang  ->  positive

Eagle Point was a windy affair with technical level scoring where Perez excelled and the Scottsdale, Arizona resident also shot an impressive -7/65 in the 3rd Round at TPC Sawgrass when the wind was at its strongest. At a career high 40th in the OWGR, Perez has always been comfortable here at the classical Colonial with 4th in 2007, 6th in 2008, 10th in 2010, and 5th on his last outing here in 2015. He's also finished in the top 10 at every PGA Tour Texas venue which again highlights a player who performs well in windy conditions.
Perez  ->  positive

Kisner has been excellent on par-4s this year, sitting T42 in overall par-4 performance and 47th in par-4 Birdie or Better percentage (17.60%). He’s achieved this mostly be being deadly accurate off the tee (68.47%) and picking great landing areas, because Kisner has never been much of a bomber – his average drive is only 288.7 yards. Luckily, KIZ also excels from a distance, ranking 17th, 49th, and 21st in approach shots from 150-175, 175-200, and above 200 respectively.
Kisner  ->  positive

When finishing 13th in 2015, Rose ranked 6th in SG: Approach and 9th in SG: Tee-to-Green so he struck the ball extremely well and it was just his short game that let him down that week. Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending. In his last two starts, Rose has ranked 29th (Northern Trust) and 3rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Around-the-Green, so his play around the greens seems to coming round at the right time.
Rose  ->  positive

He is an absolute bargain under $9,500 on both sites. Jordan Spieth  World Golf Ranking (#5)  Vegas Odds (12/1)  Draftkings ($10,800)  FanDuel ($9,700)  You thought I was going to forget out Spieth, didn't you? Can't have a stats section centered around approach shots without talking about Spieth.
Spieth  ->  positive

  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
Garcia,  ->  negative

Rory McIlroy has had solid finishes at the masters over the past four years, with his lowest finish being 25th. His finishes are not as solid as Spieth, but his statistics come in a little bit higher as he has been in solid form for 2017. McIlroy is a little better pick than Spieth because of his ability to go for the green and get eagles on par 5’s, but either would be a solid top level pick.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Clearly hungry for more wins and with correlating course form across Torrey Pines (1st), Pebble Beach (5th), Congressional (3rd) and TPC Scottsdale (5th), the 22 year old's ability to learn courses amazingly quickly could come in very handy this week. His current form reminds me of Jordan Spieth in 2015 (who made the play-off) and I can see the Rahm charge continuing all the way to Magnolia Lane. RESULT: T10  Charley Hoffman 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  The first name that jumped off the entry list for me was Charley Hoffman who I think will go well again in his beloved Texas.
Rahm  ->  positive

Of all those trading in and around 50/1 and below, he stuck out like a sore thumb and I'd have had him quite a bit shorter. My only other pick at this stage is Fabian Gomez, who really should have won the event four years ago. The Argentine messed up the final hole when in command in 2013 but he was still a maiden then and he's won twice since.
Fabian Gomez,  ->  positive
