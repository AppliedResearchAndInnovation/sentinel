Hughes has seven other top-25s, including two of his past three starts, and if the Tour Championship started today, he'd be in it, sitting 26th in points. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday.
Hughes  ->  positive

Danny Lee  ->  positive

If he keeps up the same pace of improvement here, the Green Jacket is his and regardless of whether that looks likely or not, there is no denying his suitability with the course. Henley was defending his title at the Houston Open last week and whilst he was quiet on Friday and Saturday, Henley played well on Thursday (69) and Sunday (65) to finish a respectable T8, perfect preparation once again for this week. He will need to improve in keeping bogeys off his card, never ranking higher than 16th in that department in the three starts he’s made the weekend, but now making his fifth start at Augusta, he should have a better understanding of how to do just that.
Henley  ->  positive

@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Michael Kim: (6,900) Outside of his missed cut at The Memorial, Kim has been a very steady option over the last two months, making the cut in six of his last seven starts. He has been a strong putter and birdie maker all season, ranking 37th in strokes gained putting, and 56th in birdie or better percentage.
Michael Kim:  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin – Cash – DK: $6900 FD: $7600  Hadwin has cooled off from his great form we saw earlier in the season but he still lines up great for the course and does so at an affordable price. Hadwin lines up well for the par 70 track and does so at a reasonable price on DraftKings. Comparing his Vegas odds to his price point in the VIP PGA Spreadsheet we can see Hadwin is either mispriced by DraftKings or Vegas and I think I know which one is wrong.
Hadwin  ->  positive

I’m guessing it has a lot to do with next week. Rahm is set to defend his title at Torrey Pines, and there might be some extra eyeballs on TV screens, assuming Golf Channel can figure out its labor dispute and we actually see and hear what’s going on at the course. Rahm knows peaking at the Farmers Insurance Open will be worth a substantial amount of money when he’s likely to be paired with Tiger Woods, who just happens to be making his first competitive PGA Tour start in 12 months.
Rahm  ->  positive

He can stun you at any time, especially when it comes to the Open. Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past. At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago). Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead.
Hadley  ->  positive

This is a high risk/high reward GPP play as we should expect the return from injury to suppress ownership but we really do not know what to expect in terms of play. If Hideki is fully recovered than a $9700 price tag is simply absurd for a player with his talent and who should be under owned being priced next to Tiger  Francesco Molinari – DK Value – DK: $7300 FD: $9900  In his last four starts at this event Molinari has three top tens and no finish worse than T17. Although has not necessarily excelled this year a T25 finish at the WGC – Mexico Championship was a step in the right direction for Molinari.
Molinari  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month. Stenson is tied for fifth with his 68.4 LT Adj Rd Score and ranks fourth with his 15.8 LT Adj Bird Avg.
Stenson  ->  positive

FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12500 – Spieth’s unparalleled putting gets the headlines, but last year he was second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, a major ingredient to success at TPC Scottsdale. Spieth is obviously great at all aspects of the game and can win anywhere, but his combination of smarts and talent should net him his third top-10 finish in as many starts in Scottsdale this week. Hideki Matsuyama, $12400 – You may not find one person who is pessimistic on Matsuyama this week, as the Japanese star has finished no worse than fourth in four tries at TPC Scottsdale, including back-to-back playoff wins the past two years.
Spieth,  ->  positive

The greens are really old poa annua and the course is, it kind of has, almost has a slight links feel to it. Pebble Beach is my favourite, that’s my favourite course ever, but this course is in awesome shape and like I said, the weather is, this is as good as it gets in golf.”  Hadley ticks some key statistical boxes here ranking 37th in GIR, sixth in SGTTG, 37th in SG putting, first in par 3 scoring, 38th in par 4 scoring and 27th in par 5 scoring.

Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J. Choi, J.B. Holmes and Stewart Cink and you have an event that seems pretty accessible to almost everyone.

In addition of course it means we are getting 66-1 about a player who clearly loves the event and I’m happy to take a chance at that price that the return to La Quinta will reignite his game. DAVID LINGMERTH – 66-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 57th  Finally I will close my selections for this week by weighing in with David Lingmerth in this event for the third year running. I still wake up with the occasional nightmare about ‘Duf’s shot of the rocks here in 2016, which basically cost me a 66-1 winner on Lingmerth!
Lingmerth  ->  positive

Dustin Johnson (12/1) – A man who has really suffered after an amazing start to the year is World No.1, Dustin Johnson. Johnson was unlucky not to win the PGA Championship back in 2010, receiving a two-stroke penalty in the final-round, which cost him a place in the play-off with Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer. Six years on, Johnson finally got his first major win at the U.S. Open and he only looked forward from there.
Johnson  ->  positive

Yet there may be more to his play at Augusta than his finishing positions reveal. Thomas has in fact found the nature and flow of the course fits him perfectly, just as it should, but hasn't yet been able to score quite well enough. Were he to win on Sunday, the US PGA champion would be far from alone in terms of how his first couple of looks at Augusta actually did point to his victory.
Thomas  ->  positive

He is tied for 36th in this elite field with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score. Chappell’s 60.3 LT Driving Accuracy percentage should help him navigate this tight course, and his respectable 12.1 LT Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament (Adj Bird Avg) certainly won’t hurt him. Chappell is 1-1 in his attempts at The Open: He finished T53 last year at Royal Troon.
Chappell’s  ->  positive

He's understandably a shorter price than he perhaps should be and he's definitely not for me. Jordan Spieth is a fascinating contender. His course form record is sensational and in three of the four years he's played here he's traded at odds-on.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He also played well last week in Harbour Town finishing a respectable T22 which included a final round 69. Hadwin also looks good here statswise ranking 15th in SG tee to green, third in scrambling, 18th in strokes gained putting and fourth in par 3 scoring. If he keeps up his good run of form this week he could be right in the mix.
Hadwin  ->  positive

He is an elite ball striker and his hitting a ton of greens in regulation this season. Finau has been known to struggle on Bermuda greens, but this course has allowed bad putters to win in the past. Finau will very popular this week, so if you want to reap the rewards of a high Finau finish, you will need to roster him in over 30% of your lineups.
Finau  ->  positive

Mastsuyama has been great at Riviera too: In three career starts he has never finished outside the top 25 and has posted 11th- and fourth-place finishes the past two years. Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice.

Five players to consider adding to your team...  1 Patrick Reed £14.5M  2 Ryan Moore £9.5M  3 Emiliano Grillo £12M  4 Johnson Wagner £5.5M  5 Brandt Snedeker £14M Another option is Brandt Snedeker, despite being disappointing last week we believe he has what it takes to bounce back so make sure he is in your team is your and looking to take good points this week. The Texan finished fourth last year and is good value to have in your team this week.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

He is too talented to remain in this form forever. Other Options: Rory McIlroy    Mid-Tier Plays    Daniel Berger (DK: $8,300, FD: $6,900)  This is the site of Berger’s infamous one shot, then withdraw last year. It absolutely burned me last year, but I’m going to go back to the well.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Softer conditions could favour bombers but in reality everyone is in play for the win here making this an intriguing venue for fantasy and betting purposes. Stud Picks  Bill Haas ($10,800): Haas has some tight competition at the top of the salary charts this week with Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson also playing decent golf, but Haas has been better than both recently. He recorded his best finish ever in a major at Erin Hills with a T5, and has four top 25 finishes now over his last four starts.
Haas  ->  positive

This is great news for GPP's and I also believe there is enough safety here to use him in cash games, especially in head to heads. Anirban Lahiri  World Golf Ranking (78)  Vegas Odds (41/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FantasyAces ($5,150)    I am sticking with Lahiri this week who actually seen a price decrease of $300 after a T28 last week. He has been dynamite to start both tournaments this season with six rounds under 70 and could easily have a win and contended for another had he been able to close out on Sunday with a 72 in both tournaments.

8 of his last 12 rounds here have been in the 60s and as we know Billy loves hard golf courses and is very par-70 positive. Horschel always looks forward to his visit to TPC Southwind, a course he truly loves as his comments in this 2015 interview highlight, "I think it's underappreciated. I think this is an underrated golf course.
Billy  ->  positive

This is a "home" game for Kuchar, so this year playing on two courses (Seaside and Plantation) should give him just a slight advantage over many of the other players. Jonathan Coachman -- Zach Johnson ($9,700)  This week I am going with someone who is always comfortable playing in this part of the country because he lives there -- Johnson. He hasn't had the year he would have wanted, but winning in the final event of 2016 can change all of that.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Currently ranks 11th for that all-important Scrambling stat. Selections  Cameron Smith has impressed me greatly of late - in addition to his fifth last week, he also played really well in his penultimate start at the WGC Match Play - and so I've had a small bet on him and I've also played four outsiders...  William McGirt looked too big at [90.0], given his course form figures read MC-MC-MC-9-31-9-3 and I'm happy to chance the reigning Players champion, Si Woo Kim at a massive price. the RSM Classic winner, Austin Cook, is an interesting debutant at a big price and Kevin Streelman, who currently ranks third for Scrambling and second for GIR, was third here in 2013.

David Toms  ->  positive

Although a small sample size, Hadley is near the top of the field in every statistical category I’m targeting this week. He posted a 5th place finish in 2013, which bodes well for his chances this week. Because he’s had PGA Tour status before, he’s played TPC Summerlin numerous times.
Hadley  ->  positive

How the 2017 Masters was won  Last year as noted, Garcia won his first major, doing so at a course he had previously stated he could never win at. Rose pushed him all the way on the back-9, after capitalising on two mistakes from the Spaniard on holes 10 and 11, which gave him a two stroke lead. A miraculous par-save on 13 ultimately ended up being a springboard for better things to come for Garcia, as Rose’s birdie putt slid by.
Rose  ->  positive

Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week.
Rodgers  ->  positive

The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course. Look at where Willett tends to contend, and there’s a common theme: definition from the tee. Tree-lined golf courses are without doubt those he prefers, from Augusta to Fanling and stopping at various places – Milano, Saujana, Kuala Lumpur, Wentworth, Crans – inbetween.
Willett  ->  positive

His monstrous 313.8-yard LT DD ranks second overall. Johnson has lit up Las Colinas previously with four top-10 finishes in his last six trips here and no finish worse than 20th in that stretch. His 68.5 Course Adj Rd Score is third in the field, which Johnson currently leads with 18.2 percent odds to win.
Johnson  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Ryan Moore 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  At the sharp end of the betting, Ryan Moore has plenty to play for this week with the Presidents Cup team announced in only 3 weeks time. At 18th in the current United States team standings, Moore must know that he needs to put his foot to the floor over the next 3 weeks to get into Steve Stricker's thinking, but a pot full of points from last season's Tour Championship at East Lake where he finished runner-up to Rory McIlroy in turn grabbing Davis Love III's last Ryder Cup spot, plus the 3rd at this year's Tournament of Champions at Kapalua and 9th at The Masters, means that the Nevada man is still in touch with the likes of Matt Kuchar and Charley Hoffman when it comes to automatic qualification. A win this week at a course where he grabbed his maiden PGA Tour victory in 2009 would be ever so sweet and it's certainly not beyond the realms of possibility.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Here's one last note that probably means nothing: Since 1965, there have been have only two non-U.S. winners of this tournament (but Graeme McDowell did win the 2010 U.S. Open at Pebble). DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Jordan Spieth - $12,000 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 8-1)    Spieth has not won this tournament, but he has two top-10s and two top-25s in his four visits. We surely need - and require - something better from the top price in the field.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Let’s jump into the picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama ($11,500/$11,400) – Look, I understand Jordan Spieth played out of his dome last week, and I have no doubt he could ship this week too. But to put DJ and Hideki at $1,100 and $1,200 below him this week is simply blasphemous.
Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

However, I'd prefer to have him later in the year, likely in a major. Other golfers on my 'save" list are Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler. Hatton is attractive because course history/experience isn't that relevant this week and there aren't many future spots you'll be dying to use him.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

I'm willing to bank on that happening. Zach Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($6,600)  Sometimes, it's easiest to just not overthink things when it comes to how DraftKings prices golfers each week. I wrote about Hadwin last week and he produced value yet again.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Beau Hossler at 250/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  0.5pt e.w.

For the rest, this week marks the start of the PGA Tour's stay on the west coast, and it's fairly low-key when set alongside the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship.
John Peterson  ->  positive

Off the course Palmer has been having massive problems with both his Wife’s and his own health but his tweet after his T58 in Hawaii suggests the stresses are getting easier. In a tweet this past Sunday, Palmer wrote “Happiest T58 I’ve ever had. After last two years, blessed to be back out with Jen getting healthy and myself being healthy.
Palmer  ->  positive

He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005. Scott is hitting just under 75% of greens in regulation and is one of the biggest hitters on tour. With a great record here and decent current form the Aussie could be one to watch here.
Scott  ->  positive

He was second at the high-class Open de France and fared respectably with top-25s on rare PGA Tour starts at the Houston Open and Memorial. A further angle with Uihlein is that his US residence is in Florida, suggesting he should be able to adapt to these greens. Note he was fifth on Bermuda at this year's Puerto Rico Open and also won in the Sunshine State as an amateur.
Uihlein  ->  positive

Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Last week he bounced back with a T6 at the Memorial fuelled by his best putting performance of the season as he gained 1.88 strokes putting on the field. If Stanley can transfer the confidence with the putter to TPC Southwind, then he must have an excellent opportunity of gaining his second tour win. Ranked 2nd on tour for GIRs and 12th in scoring average, he has the long game and results are starting to come with three top-10s since the start of April.
Stanley  ->  positive

RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist. That's a potent combination for The Players Championship and Kisner seems the sort who could win this at a bulky price.
Kisner  ->  positive

To be in such good current form, he must be doing some things really well. In the stats of importance this week, Steele ranks 20th in Greens in Regulation, T22 in Par-4 Performance and T34 in Par-4 Scoring Average this season. In addition, Steele ranks 15th in the All-Around Ranking.
Steele  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7400): The third golfer this week is also a mid-priced option, which leaves lots of wiggle room to squeeze in an elite golfer without blowing over the salary cap; the 29-year old Stanley has had his coming-out party this year, sitting 38th in FedEx Cup points and three top-10s including a T4 at the PLAYERS. Going back to the fall swing season, Stanley has only missed two cuts (Honda and OHL Classic), and has been one of the best on Tour in terms of tee-to-green (5th) and Bogey Avoidance (12th). Where Stanley has struggled immensely is with the flatstick in hand, ranking 165th in SG: Putting, but he’s elite in almost every other factor on the way to the green.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

While I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s a world-class player, he’s definitely a few cuts above his competition here at a very good bargain price. Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events.
Robert Garrigus  ->  positive

That being said 35/1 with 6 places being paid is a big enough price for me to get involved this week with Matt who has finished 1st (2010 - Ridgewood), 2nd (2011 - Plainfield) and 5th (2014 - Ridgewood) at The Barclays in recent years. At 15th in the FedEx Cup, but more importantly 8th in the Presidents Cup qualification race, Kuchar knows that Reed, Hoffman, Harman and Dufner are all within striking distance of denying him from an automatic qualification spot. Clearly 5 into 3 spots doesn't go.
Hoffman,  ->  positive

Cameron Smith - $7,600 (30-1)    Here's a case of the odds not being in sync with the DraftKings price – the oddsmakers like Smith more, and that catches our eye. Smith was pretty active during the fall, as many Australians tend to be, and he's riding a streak of four straight top-five cashes. Smith played well at two PGA Tour events in Asia, then headed home and tied for fourth at the Australian Open before winning the Australian PGA.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

It is a bit of a risky pick to roll with a guy who has very limited experience playing on the PGA Tour. However, if Uihlein is going to pick up a PGA Tour win in the 2017-2018 season, the fall swing season seems like an ideal time to get the job done. Ollie Schniederjans – $8,300  Similar to Uihlein, Ollie Schniederjans has to be one of the favourites to pick up his first career win in the fall swing series.
Uihlein  ->  positive

Beau was 3rd after 54 holes in Jackson, and in Las Vegas he shot a field-leading -5/66 in the teeth of the Saturday wind to take a step further and lead after 54 holes. 2nd at the Air Capital Classic at Crestview CC in Wichita appeals - PGA West champions Dufner, Vegas, Perez and Swafford have all performed well there, and despite missing the cut on his 2018 debut last week, Hossler was still hitting 80.6% Greens in Regulation. Of the rookies, he could be a real surprise this week.
Vegas  ->  positive

But who wins it? Likely one of the first seven or eight in the betting, none of whom appear to be more likely winners than Justin Thomas, who gets the vote at 10/1 with bumper each-way terms, 11/1 generally or as big as 14/1 via the exchanges. While every player at the front of the betting has much to recommend but also a question or two to answer, Thomas holds what appear to me to be the most solid credentials.
Thomas,  ->  positive

However you need to hit greens here period - a category where Phil currently sits 166th. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Justin Thomas ($11.5m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m): 3: Ryan Moore ($8.6m); 4: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.7m); 5: Chez Reavie ($6.8m); 6: Jon Rahm ($9.7m); 7: Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); 8: Brian Harman ($7.7m); 9: Jim Herman ($6.6m); 10: Sean O'Hair ($6.9m). Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select this week at a relatively low $8.6 million.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

That his Consistency drops 10 percentage points with lower salary-based expectations is something to remember when Spieth tees it up with lower odds to win — but that’s probably not something to concern yourself with for the Master: At the time of writing, Spieth has 12.5 percent odds to win, the second-highest odds in the stacked Masters field. Last year Spieth had 12.5 percent odds to win and finished with a +21.86 Plus/Minus in the tournament. Current Form  In Spieth’s six most recent tournaments, he has averaged a monster 103.92 PPT with an amazing +24.54 Plus/Minus and incredible 80 percent Consistency.
Spieth  ->  positive

This also included a change of coach. The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day.
Moore  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf: Top DraftKings Picks for the AT&T Byron Nelson  May 16, 2017 Dustin Diez  Sharelines Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka headline our top #DraftKings picks at the Byron Nelson. #fantasygolf  Most of the world's best golfers will take this week off after The Players Championship, but there are still some very nice anchors for your DraftKings lineups at the AT&T Byron Nelson. Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, and Jordan Spieth headline the event; after that, it's a pretty big drop off.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota. Johnson’s a leading favorite to win this week along with Spieth, and though I don’t think he picks up career major number two, DJ should be in contention on Sunday and I expect him to finish inside the top-10. Winner Prediction  I referenced earlier that The Open tends to favor older players.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

Willett fought back from a nightmare start to shoot an opening 69 and was three-under with seven to play in round two, only for a couple of bogeys followed by a double at the difficult 17th to see him miss out by one. The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course. Look at where Willett tends to contend, and there’s a common theme: definition from the tee.
Willett  ->  positive

Dustin Johnson, Spieth, Mickelson, Walker and Koepka have all safely qualified. Holmes, Watson, Kuchar, Fowler and Furyk amongst those down to 22nd in the current standings (see above) still have a shot at qualifying automatically this week. From there Davis Love III announces 3 of his 4 Captain's Picks after the BMW Championship (3rd of 4 events), with his final selection being announced after the Tour Championship.
Watson,  ->  positive

He's the odds-on favorite to win this week and I can understand why. Statistically, Fowler has looked superb this year, ranking 4th in scrambling and gaining almost a stroke per round (over the last six weeks) from the strokes gained around the green. As we highlighted above, that metric combined with a hot putter will inevitably put Fowler in the top 10, with a chance to win come Sunday.
Fowler  ->  positive

MID TIER TARGET ($8K/$9K RANGE)  Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports  Gary Woodland ($8,000)  In this range, we dive right to the bottom where Gary Woodland sits as the lowest tagged golfer(8 tags, 3 start, 1 sit). Paul Casey, Jason Day, Louis Oosthuizen will command a ton of ownership and while Thomas is projected for around 10%, Woodland could be even lower. There is definitely some risk with Woodland as he ranks 89th out of 96 golfers in the field when looking at Strokes Gained: Putting on my sheet.
Thomas  ->  positive

He became the fourth player, alongside Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas to have won three times on the PGA Tour this season and I can see him winning again before the season is out. Rickie Fowler (18/1) – As mentioned above, Fowler is alongside or possibly now just behind Matsuyama in terms of “best player without a major” and he will be looking forward to playing at Quail Hollow this week, a course he has won at before (2012). As well as his win, Fowler also has a 4th (2016) and a 6th (2010 – his debut) at this course, so if he could have chosen a course to get his first major win, this may well be up there.
Fowler  ->  positive

Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
Lahiri  ->  positive

This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
Barber  ->  positive

You’re going to need to make birdies here and Sneds can light it up if his putter gets going early. Ryan Armour, $7400 – His price just continues to not make sense. Last 24 rounds, these all apply:  5 th in DK points  in DK points 4 th in SG: TOT  in SG: TOT 1 st in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 3rd in SG: Ball-Striking  What else do you want this guy to do??!?
Ryan Armour,  ->  positive

Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him. Cauley ranks 8th in approaches and had some success earlier in 2017 at corollary courses like Hilton Head and the TPC Stadium course.
Cauley  ->  positive

Johnson’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score is third, his 14.1 Adj Bird Avg ranks sixth, and his 28.6 LT Putts Per Round — a large part of Kisner’s win last year — is fifth. Johnson’s game should suit this track well, but he has some seriously shaky history here. He has missed the cut three of six times but also finished 12th and 16th.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

He did gain strokes on the field putting last week at the Wells Fargo, so that is definitely a good sign. Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday.
Scott  ->  positive

Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week. The 2014 FedEx Cup champion will be desperate to return to Augusta, where he posted a career-best T17 finish last year.
Horschel  ->  positive

I personally will be splitting them in my GPP lineups but if you are looking to go contrarian you will get Rory McIlroy and Alex Noren at a big ownership discount this week. I would lean McIlroy who has been a good wind player over the years and also has a bit of course history as he finished 2nd here back in 2014. He also bounced back from a missed cut at Pebble Beach with a T20 at the Genesis so you could say he is trending in the right direction.
McIlroy  ->  positive

1pt each-way Brian Harman at 80/1 Paddy Power (7 places; 1/5 odds) Harman’s long game still needs some work but it’s starting to click into gear and already a PGA Tour winner, he could add to his tally this week. The 30-year-old has hit form in the last month with finishes of 13-MC-9-14 and is currently one of the best putters on tour, ranked 11th in strokes gained putting.
Harman  ->  positive

Steele finished the week just level-par on the long holes in 2017, which compared to Rose (-9) and Garcia (-7) was nowhere near good enough. Even Garcia and Rose were some way off the best in the field on the Par 5’s as Charl Schwartzel was 12-under-par. Steele has never finished inside the top-10 in a major which is an obvious negative, but he has been solid in recent years, at both the PGA Championship and U.S. Open, posting finishes of T12 (2015) and T13/T15 (2017/2016) in these events respectively.
Rose  ->  positive

Boasts five top-4 finishes in 2017, including a T-4 at the Irish Open. Justin Rose. The Englishman has a major under his belt (2013 U.S. Open) and came extremely close to another this year, bowing in a playoff at the Masters to Sergio Garcia.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

Sweden's Henrik Stenson prepares to putt on the 5th hole on day three of the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links, Troon, Scotland, Saturday July 15, 2017. (Mark Runnacles/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)  IRVINE, Scotland (AP) — Henrik Stenson is pessimistic about his chances of successfully defending the British Open title at Royal Birkdale next week. The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again.
Henrik Stenson  ->  negative

Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose , Kevin Chappell & Ryan Moore – Keeping things pretty chalky in the B-List, with a troika of former champs and a player on the ascent. Kuch has made nine cuts in a row at The Memorial, highlighted by a win in 2013, six Top 10s, and no finish worse than T26. If the course was designed by Pete Dye or Jack Nicklaus, you always play Kuchar… Hideki missed the cut last season following a win and a T5 in his first two appearances.
Matt Kuchar,  ->  positive

Starting cash lineups is a great idea. Bud Cauley ($9,400): WD on Tuesday Cauley sees a massive price jump this week as he was only $6,900 the last time out on DraftKings at the Valero. He’s now recorded three top tens in a row however and it has been mostly on the back of some great tee to green work which bodes extremely well for this week.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Jason Dufner ($8,800): Dufner ruined several lineups for people last week with his weekend plunge. However, Dufner has a knack for this course as he is 6/6 for making cuts year in the last 6 years with 3 top 10 finishes. He also checks the box for us ranking 46th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 26th in BoB%.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

He can stun you at any time, especially when it comes to the Open. Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
Spieth,  ->  positive

RFO - Jeremy Chapman - Sentry TOC - 3pts win Spieth @ 6-1; 1.5ew Rahm 12-1, Matsuyama 12-1; 1ew Perez 33-1; 0.5ew Bryan 200-1
Spieth  ->  positive

He may have found something in Mexico though as he gained strokes on the field putting in the final two rounds. With a ninth place finish at this event from last season to build on, Casey looks poised for a big week. I’m going out on a limb and saying Casey not only produces for DFS here but lands his second PGA Tour win as well.
Casey  ->  positive

Valero may be tough, but Hadwin has risen to virtually every challenge he’s faced thus far, and his short game should serve him quite well here. Stewart Cink ($7,400) – Cink may have had a bad stretch for a few holes on the back nine last week, but that should not overshadow an incredibly consistent year of golf from a guy who is already known for being super consistent to begin with. Cink has the versatility required to at least make the cut for you this week, and if his form serves, he’s quite capable of doing more than that on tough courses as well.
Cink  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Chappell  ->  positive

Look for him to add a nice chunk to that total at a place where he lost a playoff to Jim Furyk in 2015. Adam Hadwin: The Canadian's breakthrough season continued with a T-36 in his Masters debut. Previously, he picked up his first PGA Tour win at the Valspar Championship, had a runner-up at Career Builder where he also shot 59 and more recently, .finished sixth place at Bay Hill.
Adam Hadwin:  ->  positive

*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
Walker  ->  positive

It's also worth remembering that Harris has a 5th (2012) and 2nd (2016) to his name at Colonial and won the 2013 OHL Classic at El Camaleon - 2 courses where Lee has also finished 6th (Colonial 2017) and 3rd (El Camaleon 2014). English's altitude golf credentials are completed by a 4th earlier this season at TPC Summerlin in Las Vegas, a course where Jonas Blixt finished 3rd in 2012 prior to winning here in 2013. Result: T29  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 80/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  At a tournament where web.com graduates have had so much success, I'm keeping Ollie Schniederjans on side this week.
Harris  ->  positive

And while glowing praise around his achievements doesn't mean much in relation to this event, Cantlay would be a top-40 player in birdie average terms had he played enough rounds to qualify, and his no-weakness, all-round game seems ideally suited to a course which has thrown up all kinds of players. Cantlay shot 60 when playing in the Travelers Championship as an amateur back in 2011 so his adaptability and scoring prowess is not in question and he does actually have some experience of Conway Farms, having played in the Western Amateur here back in 2009. Video element not supported Cantlay's tee on No.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Palmer has also only missed the cut twice in that span, so he generally sticks around for the whole week here. Off the course Palmer has been having massive problems with both his Wife’s and his own health but his tweet after his T58 in Hawaii suggests the stresses are getting easier. In a tweet this past Sunday, Palmer wrote “Happiest T58 I’ve ever had.
Palmer  ->  positive

Whilst he is only 20/1, the positives outweigh the negatives here and he looks in good shape to contend for his first win of the season. Thorbjorn Olesen 100/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Thobjorn Olesen is a fantastic player, who despite winning four times already sometimes gets looked at as an underachiever. One thing for sure is that Olesen will be desperate to make the European Ryder Cup team, as his compatriot Bjorn is the captain this time around.
Thorbjorn Olesen  ->  positive

It is no surprise that Horsfield has been invited to this event given his huge potential and clear ties to the area and he will look to make good on this rare opportunity, after starting the season fairly well on the European Tour. Horsfield has twice qualified for the U.S. Open but missed the cut on both occasions, and whilst he has played a handful of times on the PGA Tour he is still yet to better his T48 finish at the RBC Candian Open, so why will it be different this week? Well after romping home to an eight-stroke victory at the final stage of Q-School after six gruelling rounds, it appeared Horsfield was finally ready to make the big step in the professional game and he has shown a few signs of doing just that since.
Horsfield  ->  positive

The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
Tiger Woods  ->  negative

Quick thoughts on @ValsparChamp: Everyone is going to be all over Haas. Could be a good time for Hadwin. Luke Donald - not so sneaky play
Hadwin.  ->  positive

I’ll ride him until he runs into the man below. John Rahm ($10,800): Last year’s runner-up here, Rahm went through most of the field like a buzzsaw in 2017 and should do so again this year. There’s not too much more to say as he’s my pick to win it all in a rematch with DJ.
Rahm  ->  positive

Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Dustin Johnson ($11,300)  So far, the Masters is the weakest major on his resume, but the course is built for a bomber like DJ, who should overpower the par 5s like Tiger in his prime. And that's who Johnson most resembles right now after winning his last three starts.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

BEAU HOSSLER – 150-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 2nd  For my final selection this week I am going to roll the dice again with a player who we were on earlier in the year in the form of Beau Hossler. Regular readers of my work will know that I picked Hossler as one of my players to follow for 2018 and on the West Coast swing he was certainly living up to the bill. As a native Californian it’s not surprising that Beau cooled off a bit once the tour reached Florida however I am hoping that a trip to his adopted home state of Texas will reignite things.
Hossler.  ->  positive

Perez, by the way, has a couple of top sevens at Innisbrook. Bryan, a three-time winner on the Web.com last year (the first two coming in late March and April), is a short hitter (167th Driving Distance), who does his best work on and around the greens (35th Scrambling, 7th Putts Per Round) so this place should be a good fit. Finally, I found an article on discoversouthcarolina.com about him and his brother George.
Perez,  ->  positive

Justin Rose: Rose has alternated two missed cuts with fourth- and 19th-place finishes here the past four years, but he is playing some of the best golf of his career currently: His 66.8 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks second among golfers in the field with more than one start the past six weeks. Importantly, Rose’s 20.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks second overall. Martin Kaymer: Kaymer’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score ranks 25th, and he’s tied for 23rd in the field with his 14.2 LT Adj Bird Avg.
Rose:  ->  positive

Robert Garrigus ($6,600): Garrigus made my list last week as a low salary value play and he came through with a decent week; which included ranking 8th in SG: Approach. Garrigus generally has a good record at this event with only one missed cut in six attempts and comes in needing another good week here for FedEx cup purposes. With no price increase, and a weak field overall, we should continue to target him on DraftKings until the price goes up.
Garrigus  ->  positive

We all know it's coming and this week is a huge opportunity for the Georgia Tech product. RESULT: MC  Jhonattan Vegas 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  I'm always preaching patience so let's stick with Jhonattan Vegas for a further week on a course where he has a habit of playing well.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players as follows;  RORY SABBATINI – 25-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 43rd  This pick is purely about current form. I said after watching Sabbatini at the Valspar on Sunday a couple of weeks ago that I felt he would win soon and until he either does so, or his form dips, I want to keep him onside. Rory is the sort of player who can play well anywhere if he is on one of his rolls.
Sabbatini  ->  positive

It’s the inaugural version of this event, so not much to talk about in the way of past winners. The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner.
Pieters  ->  positive

I'm e/w on Brown, SW Kim &amp; Rodgers in RSM Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
Rodgers  ->  positive

However, we will be avoiding him for two reasons. First, Kaymer is a terrible chipper around the greens and going back to our Kisner interview this week, you’re going to have to chip the ball well off these closely shaved areas around the green. Second, he’s going to be extremely popular when people see the name, pedigree, and price tag.
Kisner  ->  positive

Thomas called his former Alabama team-mate, Lee Knox as soon as he qualified for the Masters last year, organising to stay with him throughout the week. The advantage of doing so, was Thomas managed to go out on practice rounds with Lee’s father, Jeff who we all know very well. Knox is the non-playing marker at Augusta National, and if required (when an odd number of players make the cut) often beats his playing partners, although his score is never official.
Thomas  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  You get the feeling that Rickie Fowler means business right now. 2017 saw Fowler play second fiddle to his Jupiter, Florida comrades Dustin Johnson (World Number 1), Brooks Koepka (World Number 8) and Justin Thomas (World Number 3) who between them amassed 11 victories last year including the U.S. Open, PGA Championship and 2 World Golf Championships. You can throw in a FedEx Cup title for good measure as well.
Fowler  ->  positive

Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play. Wagner is notorious for fast starts on Thursdays, and he was finally able to sustain that and post a top-5 finish last weekend. He also loves this course, making his past five cuts including an 11th and a runner-up finish.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

And I have been doing a fantastic job at that the last month or so, so you can't be too hard on yourself." On a layout where he shone last year, List can make another title surge. He's been in the top five for Driving Distance at this event in both 2016 and 2017 so loves to hit driver and he was ranked first for Scrambling last year so can chip well from these run-off areas around the greens.
List  ->  positive

And, with that being so critical this week, it makes him a risky proposition despite his pedigree. However his play at The Masters has me thinking he’s started to get his driver corrected, and, if that’s the case, expect a slot on the Sunday leaderboard… Chappell has struggled through identical issues as Walker. He lost to the ability to drive the ball effectively.
Chappell  ->  positive

Lucas Glover ($13,900) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %.
Glover  ->  positive

PGA Tour Fantasy Golf DraftKings Picks – Valero Texas Open  Lock of the week:  Brendan Steele $9,900 – Steele is a major steal in our cash and GPP lineups this week. He’s been extremely consistent this season having not missed a cut all year. Southern Texas is also the site of his first PGA Tour victory.
Steele  ->  positive

Retief Goosen $7.1 million - just ask yourself again. I personally have big doubts about Rickie Fowler at $9.5 million as well. Naturally he could explode into tournament wining form at any point, but Fowler 2017-style to date has been a pale impersonation of 2016-style where he had already finished 5th at Kapalua and won in Abu Dhabi.
Fowler  ->  negative

Spieth is currently 20th in Good Drive Percentage and performs well in Par 4 and Par 5 Scoring for the distances that TPC River Highlands features. Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

He’s definitely mispriced, even given his long-term marks: He has a superior LT Adj Rd score (68.4) than even Rickie Fowler (68.5), who is priced up at $10,600 on DraftKings. As usual, Casey should be the chalky mid-tier option of the week. Charley Hoffman lost last week in a playoff with Jhonattan Vegas but still had an impressive weekend, going 68 or lower in all four rounds at the RBC Canadian Open.
Casey  ->  positive

Of the past seven winners, all of them ranked inside the top twenty for the week in GIR percentage. Stud Picks  Jason Day ($10,800): Day has actually lost strokes to the field on his approach shots over six of his last eight rounds, but has still managed to pull off 15th and 2nd place finishes in his last two starts. To make a long story short, Day is killing it on and around the greens right now, something he did with regularity last year, but is lacking with his iron play.
Day  ->  positive

He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old. Also like: Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
Spieth,  ->  positive

One week after that debut at Augusta he was invited here, and he finished T23 when still an amateur. Despite missing the cut this time last year, I feel Fitzpatrick has an excellent chance to make that splash on the PGA Tour that many are expecting. His putting is a strength of his, just like his fellow countrymen, Luke Donald who has a brilliant track record here at Harbour Town.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Jeff Bergerson: J.B. Holmes ($7,100)  As long as DraftKings is going to offer bargain basement pricing for some of the absolute best players in the world, I am going to buy. Holmes has not been lighting the world on fire thus far this year, but his worst finish since last summer is T35. In his past nine appearances at Riviera, he has missed only one cut and has six top-15 finishes.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

It would appear therefore that he is the sort of player who takes a momentum on to the next week and if he can do that here, when returning to a venue he has improved at every year, he could well surprise at a big price. ZACH JOHNSON – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 10 Finished 36th  The final place in this years team goes to another former Masters Champion in the form of Zach Johnson. Zach is winless since his memorable victory at St Andrews in 2015, however there have been signs since the end of last year that he is getting back on track.
ZACH JOHNSON  ->  positive

As with DJ, the encouragement for that comes from looking at this year's Bogey Avoidance stats where Fowler is ranked 4th (he makes one on just over 10% of his holes). Other very Augusta-friendly Strokes Gained stats from Fowler are 9th in Putting, 4th Tee-To-Green, 24th Driving Distance, 3rd Approach-The-Green, 1st Scoring Average, 1st Sand Save Percentage (nearly 80%) and 3rd Scrambling. If he can bring all those parts of his game to Augusta, he must have a golden chance of landing his first major.
Fowler  ->  positive

Only reason I'm leaving him on the bench to begin with is because I have one start remaining. EXPERT BEN EVERILL , Staff Writer LINEUP | BENCH Jason Day  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Adam Scott  Dustin Johnson  Rory McIlroy  PROJECTED CHAMPION Adam Scott Former champion needs a kick for his season to be up to standard. Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Given that the schedule was different owing to golf's return to the Olympics last year, that's actually four from six so a close look at the PGA Championship leaderboard is as good a starting point as any. That makes in-form Matt Kuchar interesting in an event he's won before, but at a bigger price I prefer the claims of Louis Oosthuizen given the potential for this event to favour big-hitters. Oosthuizen completed a career grand slam of runner-up finishes in the majors as he shared second with Reed at Quail Hollow, and that's further proof of how big-time he is despite so often proving frustrating.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week. All of that being said, I’m not sure this is the week I want to attack Justin Thomas. On a course that is going to be a second shot course that requires good proximity and scrambling and some accuracy off the tee, I don’t know that this track favors JT enough to really want to dive head first into rostering him too heavily in GPPs.
JT  ->  negative

Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me. Ryan Moore 100/1 (Betfred & Skybet 6 places 1/4 odds, Betfair & PaddyPower 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  A disappointing season for Ryan Moore seems to be on the up of late, finishing inside the top-28 in each of his last three events. At the WGC Bridgestone Invitational Moore opened up with a round of 73 and it looked like his poor form would continue, however over the next three rounds he broke 70 in each and finished T28.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Jordan Spieth 2pts EW 16/1 with NEW OFFER! Bet £10 get £30 available via this link using promo code SPORTS60  TPC Boston is the perfect terrain for Predictor Number 1 Jordan Spieth. This is the venue where, in 2013, the Tour rookie shot a final round -9/62 - he finished birdie, birdie, eagle - to finish 4th and announce to Fred Couples that he was more than ready for a Captain's pick into the President's Cup team.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG. Perez has consistently been a great play on DraftKings, because he’s one of the best in the field at putting up birdies. He averages 4.16 (15th) per round, and is above-average on the par-4s (53rd), so although he has some warts he should find some success here.
Perez  ->  positive

He's definitely not for me at around [30.0], even though he has form here, having finished 10th on debut in 2015. Selections  Rain will irritate the field for most of the week, temperatures will be far cooler than the norm and we'll even get a bit of wind so I fancy it could be a week for a wily old patient pro, so step forward Zach Johnson. The 40-year multiple winner is simply too big at [32.0] after his eye-catching performance last week at the Sony where he ranked 17th for GIR and eighth for Putting Average.
Zach Johnson.  ->  positive

Of course there have been changes made and like the rest of the field this will be new to him, but course form should still hold up to a certain extent this week, especially if a player is in form, which Fowler is. Fowler has five top-10’s in his last seven starts and also won the Honda Classic back in February, so it has been another memorable season for the young American. He needs to get a major win to really put himself at that next level and given how close he has come on numerous occasions, it would take a brave man to bet against him, each time he pegs it up at any one of the four.
Fowler  ->  positive

But it was at Muirfield Village where Watson really came to the fore for me this week. Rounds of 71-68-68 placed him in 3rd spot going into the final round and despite a 73 on Sunday, Watson held on for a morale-boosting season's best 6th place finish. 10th for Greens in Regulation, 13th for Putting Average, an eye-opening 11th for Strokes Gained Putting and joint tournament best -8 across the par-4s were keys to a strong result against the likes of Fowler, Thomas, Kisner and Spieth.
Watson  ->  positive

His stats are thrown off a bit from a rough final month in ’17, but a third place finish at the Tour Championship and a fourth at the RSM makes Kisner a nice guy to model your team around. Pat Perez, 8000: The veteran is fresh off a win in the swing season and is always a guy to roster early in the season. He came in third last year at the TOC and is 5-for-6 in cuts made at the Sony Open.
Pat Perez,  ->  positive

McIlroy is tied with Johnson atop the field with his 67.6 LT Adj Rd Score, and his massive, field-best 17.5 LT Adj Bird Avg makes him an elite play in DraftKings’ birdie-heavy scoring system every week. On FanDuel, McIlroy ranks behind only Johnson with 50.6 fantasy points per game in Rounds 3 and 4. We currently have McIlroy projected to be the chalk play of the week with 26-30 percent ownership in large-field tournaments.
Johnson  ->  positive

Spieth rates the award highly and, as if winning two trophies and a $10million jackpot wasn't enough, it's another factor to motivate him. Justin Thomas has five wins, including a major, and must be favourite at it stands but Spieth could still change the script. "I think I have to win the tournament to be Player of the Year or at least have a chance to be Player of the Year and that's our MVP, that's the most important award," he said last Sunday.
Spieth  ->  positive

It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
Stenson  ->  positive

I will be looking at great wedge players and putters to fill my line up this week.

Fowler has performed close to or at his best since missing the cut at Torrey Pines, days after he'd flown in from a tiring title defence in Abu Dhabi, and several of his stats suggest the discovery of career-best form at just the right time. Fowler's short-game is especially strong at the moment - he's third in the PGA Tour's scrambling stats and is 28th in strokes-gained around the green - and he's putting with the same confidence he demonstrated when finishing inside the top-five at every major championship in 2014. Putting was certainly an issue last year - Fowler dipped from a top-35 putter to a mid-level one - and given that he's driving it well, flushing his irons and generally avoiding the sort of mistakes which used to ruin at least one of his four cards (fourth in bogey avoidance, a strength which was once a weakness), everything is in place for a breakthrough week at Augusta.
Fowler's  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bradley was first for greens in regulation at the Travelers so his irons were dialled in while he was third on the All-Around so did everything well. If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there.
Bradley's  ->  positive

Now tweets alone are not enough to go by, but I do believe him. With a baby on the way, Peterson needs to start cashing cheques and realising his potential, something a lot of players tend to do when facing parenthood for the first time. There are other indicators that this can be a good sport for Peterson also.
Peterson  ->  positive

This week the course is much tighter and more demanding. Spieth appears to be dialed in and prepared for a big year. Bob Harig: Jimmy Walker ($9,900)  Two of Walker's six career PGA Tour victories have come at the Sony Open and Hawaii definitely seems to agree with him.
Spieth  ->  positive

He caught the eye last week at Hilton Head when he finished fifth and I was happy enough to play him at [40.0]. Harris English put in a strange performance last week, playing brilliantly one day and awful the next but nobody bettered his six-under-par 65 on Sunday so I thought I'd chance him at a triple-figure price, given he's a former OHL Classic winner, and I've also thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned Aussie, Aaron Baddeley, at a huge price. Selections:  Billy Horschel @ [40.0]  Harris English @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [180.0]  I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play blog.
Aaron Baddeley,  ->  positive

Fowler is playing his superb T2G game with the confidence and poise of a soon-to-be major winner, and this event will provide him with a very nice warmup for Erin Hills next week. UPPER TIER  Phil Mickelson ($10,200) – There’s always a little concern over the “week before major” narrative with guys who are already qualified, but now that we know Phil will not be playing it, this event just got that much better for him. Phil has finished no worse than 11th in the past four years here with two runner-up finishes and a third.
Phil  ->  positive

From an altitude golf perspective, Sung has a great record at the web.com Utah Championship - finishing 2nd at Willow Creek Country Club (-17/271) in 2014 and 2nd at Thanks Giving Point Golf Club (-19/269) in 2015, with a top-7 at Boise confirming that he can handle approach distance mathematics. Kang also sits 65th in Strokes Gained Putting, 59th for Birdie Average and 1st for Total Birdies across the PGA Tour this season. Result: MC  Harris English 1pt EW 70/1 with NEW OFFER!
Kang  ->  positive

The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat. Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average.

Ryan Moore and Adam Hadwin were others who caught my eye. Moore had an excellent Masters until falling away on Sunday to finish T9. He also posted T8 at this venue on his only start in 2012.
Moore  ->  positive

Ryan Moore 100/1 (Betfred & Skybet 6 places 1/4 odds, Betfair & PaddyPower 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  A disappointing season for Ryan Moore seems to be on the up of late, finishing inside the top-28 in each of his last three events. At the WGC Bridgestone Invitational Moore opened up with a round of 73 and it looked like his poor form would continue, however over the next three rounds he broke 70 in each and finished T28. Moore then went on to play at the US PGA Championship, opening with a pair of 71’s before shooting his worst round of the week, a 73 on Saturday.
Moore  ->  positive

Tiger  ->  negative

He still can’t putt, but his irons returned in a big way at the Sony, and with his familiarity with these greens, an average putting week again could lock in a top-10 spot. Ditto for Scott Piercy. Coming off an injury-plagued 2017, he too got his irons back on track at the Sony and historically is one of the premier par-4 scorers in the field.
Scott Piercy.  ->  positive

His past five years here shook out in finishes of 5/11/4/64/6. Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure.
Day  ->  positive

I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on. Jason Day ($9,300): Speaking of putting, the Aussie is in a class of his own with it comes to putting this year. Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end.
Jason Day  ->  positive

Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well. Jordan Spieth ($10800): After a week where the talk was Dustin Johnson’s (almost) triumphant return to the links, it’s easy for most to forget just how good Jordan Spieth actually is.
Henley  ->  positive

35th in the Corales Championship featured a 2nd Round -6/66 which was the 3rd best round of the day and powered Every into contention - he eventually finished 35th. The week after in Houston, which has MiniVerde Bermuda base greens, Every shot a Round 1 -5/67 good enough for 10th. A Sunday -6/66 then propelled Matt into an 8th place finish, good enough for a $182,000 pay cheque.
Every  ->  positive

Here are a few players to consider from every price range. High-Priced  Jordan Spieth ($11,500) – A big part of the talk leading up to this year’s U.S. Open is the absolutely pristine condition of the greens at Erin Hills. They are already relatively straightforward greens to read, and while in some cases that levels the playing field a bit between the elite putters and the rest, it can also serve as the setting for an absolutely blistering round or two of putting to put someone like Spieth over the top.
Spieth  ->  positive

His price remains the same heading into this week and people are jumping ship after back-to-back missed cuts. With only 10 tags on FanShareSports (two of them being sit calls), Walker is flying under the radar in a field of subpar strength. Walker lost three strokes on the field last week around the green and his putter could not pick up the slack.
Walker  ->  positive

But Scott’s ability to get to the green is slowly returning to an elite level, and that’s what we should all care about this week. Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott.
Scott’s  ->  positive

He has done well at PGA National, with top-15s in three of the past four years. Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago.

Billy Hurley – GPP Punt – DK: $6200 FD: $5800  If you’re looking for a low 6K salary to fill out some rosters I think Billy Hurley is a viable option.

Hurley has the best Vegas odds of anyone priced under $6300 and there’s good reason for that.

Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage. I prefer Haas over Webb this week due to a few stats.
Haas  ->  positive

He's a strong performer on difficult courses and a great putter. I think this is the year Noren makes a name for himself on the PGA Tour (as he's already done), and caps it off with top-10's in all majors. I think he's a great GPP play and could see using him in cash, but there are some better "on the surface" plays at cheaper price tags for cash games.
Noren  ->  positive

Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events. Paul Casey ($10,200) – People looking at Casey’s recent history here (43rd, MC) will be turned off, but he’s posted 13th and 5th place finishes previously at Colonial. When we’re targeting accurate ball-strikers, Casey pops to the top of our list.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week. Ian Poulter – Cash – DK: $8700 FD: $7400  Poulter continued his streak of good play at the Open Championship with a T14 finish. Poulter is among the elite in Shots Gained: Approach and Shots Gained: Scrambling this season which makes him a safe play and perfect for cash.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
Stricker  ->  positive

4th at 36 and 54 holes at the Puerto Rico Open was the launchpad and although Rafael finished 10th, that was enough to earn a further main-Tour start at the Houston Open. The trip to Texas again saw Campos in contention and he earned a lot of respect that week, taking a great each-way return with 7th spot. 32nd at The Heritage then followed and from there he went on to again tackle the web.com Tour for a second time.
Campos  ->  positive

DJ had a 10-footer at 18 to win this tournament two years ago. He missed and then lost out in a play-off to John Hahn's 25-footer on the third extra hole. That was just Johnson's third tournament back after a six-month break for "personal challenges" and perhaps the competitive rust only really came out at the finish when he closed with a bogey-6 at 17 and a par at the last.
Johnson's  ->  positive

“This will give me a little more info on how my game stacks up out here,” he revealed. “It is a pretty special place to come and a dream come true to be out here and I feel like I am knocking on the door.”  McNealy is in enviable position - his father is a Silicon Valley billionaire so it won’t really matter which career path McNealy the younger does eventual land on. There is a little or no pressure on him at the moment with an exciting summer ahead and he does not look out of his depth in the slightest here in a very beatable field if some of the bigger names fail to fire.
McNealy  ->  positive

The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms. Jason Day has had a rocky start to 2017 with one top 10 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and a missed cut.

Plenty of people have pegged Finau as a big time break out player this year, and a win this week would be a huge start to the season for Tony. J.J. Spaun – $7,600  J.J. Spaun comes in ranked first in my weighted stat model this week because he finished the 2017 season hot as hell. Perhaps it is lucky for us that he didn’t pick up his first career title in the fall swing season and was saving it for the 2018 Sony Open.

Koepka didn’t play here last year, but finished T26 on debut in 2014 before finishing 70th in 2015. Whilst it is a small sample size, an in-form Koepka should like the way this course sets up and hopefully that driver straightens out this week. Hudson Swafford 175/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Hudson Swafford broke his PGA Tour duck this season, winning the CareerBuilder Challenge but it has been anything but plain sailing since.
Koepka  ->  positive

If he can get the putter going he could be a big danger man here. Lucas Glover 33/1  Glover is another player that looks to be in fine form coming into this event with two top 5’s in his last three tournaments. After a missed cut at The Safeway, Glover bounced back with a T5 at The Sanderson Farms finishing on 15 under for the tournament and didn’t shoot worse than a 70.
Glover  ->  positive

Given a large number of those ahead of him in the betting will be using this as a warm up as opposed to going for the win, Henley arguably looks one of, if not the most obvious winner this week. Thomas Pieters 55/1 (MarathonBet, UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Whilst not in the finest form at the moment, Pieters looks an intriguing prospect on a course that he should be able to take advantage of. Pieters’ biggest strength is his length off the tee, but he is also a streaky putter and if he can find his touch on the greens, this test should suit.
Pieters  ->  positive

Furyk, for instance, should have won both; Webb Simpson has lost a play-off for both; Chris Kirk and Heath Slocum have won the RSM and contended for the RBC, just like Kisner. Given that the RSM Classic remains in its infancy, the ties between leaderboards have been established rapidly and Kisner can become the first man to win both having recaptured his best form this year, including when going down by a single stroke in the Arnold Palmer Invitational last month. I thought he was unlucky at Bay Hill, even if as a backer at 66/1 I'd love to blame him for everything that went wrong.
Kisner.  ->  positive

He is the definition of a tee-to-green specialist, and should make good on his DFS nickname “Chalk Howell” this week – and for good reason. Harris English ($7,500) – Another rather generous price break for a guy who is basically the younger version of CH3, and a better putter at that as a bonus. English has never missed a cut here to go with three top-ten finishes and plenty of tee-to-green prowess to fit this course perfectly at a fine discount.
Harris English  ->  positive

After regaining some self-confidence, look for Bubba to start posting some low numbers starting this week at Innibrook, a place where he has posted a top 3 before. Others to Consider: Charles Howell III ($9,400), Bill Haas ($9,200), Webb Simpson ($8,500), Graham DeLeat ($8,400), Tony Finau ($7,700), Chris Kirk ($6,900)  Player projections, stats models, DFS lineup builders and much more!

The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

With wins at Augusta and St. Andrews as well as contending last week at the 7,400 yard Firestone, it would be naïve to rule Johnson out based on the length of the course. After a very slow start to the season, Johnson looks to have picked it up when it matters most, heading into the business-end of the season. In his last three starts he has finished 5th (John Deere Classic), 14th (Open Championship) and 2nd last week at the Bridgestone, so he has got it rolling once again.
Johnson  ->  positive

Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

ADVERTISEMENT  Jordan Spieth who won at Pebble Beach this past weekend is joined by; World No.1 Jason Day, Dustin Johnson (#3), Hideki Matsuyama (#5), Adam Scott (#7), Justin Thomas (#8), Sergio Garcia (#9) and Patrick Reed (#10). Three of these players (Spieth, Matsuyama and Garcia) are coming off wins in their last starts. Garcia won the Dubai Desert Classic two weeks ago, going wire-to-wire to beat Henrik Stenson by three strokes, whilst Matsuyama overcame the challenge of Webb Simpson in a play-off, to win the Phoenix Open.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

BARGAIN BIN  Charles Howell III ($7,000) – Finally, a warm welcome back to one of my favorite golfers on tour! Chalk Howell III is back, and although he will undoubtedly not be very chalky this week as he’s returning from layoff due to a rib injury, he’s still one of the most versatile T2G players out there for a discount price, particularly in this field. Most importantly, however, he’s highly unlikely to miss that cut for you.
Howell III  ->  positive

Steele set for improvement  Back Brendan Steele for a Top 30 Finish 6u @ 11/5  Back Adam Hadwin for a Top 30 Finish 6u @ 2/1  Similar comments apply to this pair. Steele's stellar long game should be perfect for tough, championship courses and explain why he's finished top-15 in the last two US Opens. I doubt his short game is good enough to challenge at Augusta but 27th last year was no disgrace on only his second visit.
Steele  ->  positive

Of course all that matters is that Harrington got it done when it counted. Berger, who was born and educated in Florida would have been hoping for a successful return in 2016 however he failed to make the cut, with opening rounds of 73-72. Leading into the event last year, Berger’s recent results read MC-58-MC-42, so it was perhaps not a surprise he missed the cut.
Berger,  ->  positive

Paul Casey: One of the top golfers in the CSURAM88 Model, Casey is second and fourth with a 63.3 percent LT SC mark and 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall.
Casey:  ->  positive

Grayson Murray  16. Scott Hend  17. Adam Hadwin  18.
Scott  ->  positive

Noren is also 40th in scrambling. Tier 2 Values    Gary Woodland - $9,700 (25-1)  Woodland is the rare player who hits it far off the tee yet is accurate. He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation.
Woodland  ->  positive

Lower Tier  Luke List ($7600) (Finished 29th here last year)  JJ Spaun ($7800)  Anirban Lahiri ($7300)  Sung Kang ($7400)  Nick Watney ($7500)  Martin Laird ($7700)  GPP wild cards with upside  Daniel Summerhays ($7000)  Freddie Jacobson ($6500)  Shawn Stefani ($6100)  Kevin Tway ($6000) I like him for his course history and the fact he ranks 4th in Bogey Avoidance for a course that could potentially see the winner in single digits under par. (Patrick Reed $9700 and Zach Johnson $9300 have worse odds to win it all than Billy does).
Daniel Summerhays  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

His tee-to-green proficiency has already yielded a trio of top 10s this season, and with a taut short game (31st in scrambling), he's 21st on TOUR in adjusted scoring. Robert Garrigus … Profiles as the kind of bomber that makes sense on occasion at TPC Scottsdale, just as long as his putter is cooperating. The 14th club has been both his bane and boon over the years.
Robert Garrigus  ->  positive

Disappointed at Royal Birkdale, but he has a good record at Firestone, which isn’t surprising considering his ballstriking talent. Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
Paul Casey.  ->  positive

Rose’s 2017 stats aren’t quite as sharp as always but he still sits prominently in many of the key ones for this week. Rose is 25th in driving distance, 14th in GIR, 13th in strokes gained: tee to green and 10th in scoring relative to par for approaches over 200 yards. Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong.
Rose  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick. However, he began the year hot, looking more and more like his old self, especially with his putter.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – DEAN & DELUCA Invitational  Lock of the week:  Sergio Garcia $10,800 – We absolutely love Sergio this week on a course that should set up well for a tremendous ball striker like he is. Strokes Gained off the Tee and Strokes Gained Approach are two of our favorite stat categories this week and Garcia is amongst the top 20 in the field in both. The Spaniard faltered a little on Sunday last week but had a tremendous back nine 29 on Saturday and is still on a heater coming off that Masters win in April.
Sergio  ->  positive

Really, a stunner. Yes, Spieth was horrible in missing the cut last week at Phoenix. But his track record here is exemplary, with three top-10s and five top-25s in five visits.
Spieth  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin – $7,600  Adam Hadwin was heavily owned last week, and even though he didn’t miss the cut, he certainly didn’t win anyone money. Hadwin only has six tags on FanShareSports, clearly showing people have already moved on. Let’s not forget Hadwin is still playing the best golf of his life and easily turn things around in preparation for his first US Open.
Hadwin  ->  positive

With little wind forecast for day one scoring is bound to be low , making a confident touch on Bermuda greens imperative." *EW Terms: 1/4 Odds | 5 Places  Steve Rawlings says: Back Bubba Watson @ 40/1  Bubba Watson is a mercurial character and there isn't a venue played that doesn't highlight his unpredictability better than Bay Hill. It was in this event in 2014 that he withdrew after shooting an 11-over-par 83 in the opening round, which included an 11 at the par five sixth hole!
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Whilst based on his season so far, 40/1 may look short and a slight overreaction to his Masters finish, it was his play when in-form last year that justify his odds. Chappell has not suddenly become a bad player, he was just going through a bad patch (not surprising given his run last year), and he may just have found his form again at Augusta. It is worth remembering Chappell’s strong showing at the FedEx Cup play-offs, finishing 2nd at the season-ending Tour Championship and 8th at the Deutsche Bank Championship, proving he has plenty of game, on the biggest of stages.
Chappell  ->  positive

Fleetwood has all the tools to win at Riviera. Chez Reavie – $8,000  I missed the wagon on Chez last week after he followed up his Waste Management runner-up with another second place finish. Chez has clearly found something in his game and it is firing on all cylinders right now.
Chez  ->  positive

Weekley is 60th on Tour in GIR and T35 in proximity, so he does have the right game for Harbour Town. Zac Blair - $6,500 (Field, 5-2)    If all PGA Tour courses were short, Blair would be having a much better career. He's made 11-of-15 cuts this season and is coming off his best showing, a T8 at Houston.
Zac Blair  ->  positive

Broadening the TifEagle link out slightly, excellent performances on the pure TifEagle greens featured at Kapalua, PGA National, Doral and Bay Hill (from 2016 onwards) link in perfectly as well. My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Brian Harman has a decent enough record here and we know that the 33/1-40/1 price point is a sweet spot for previous RBC Heritage winners.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor. If you are going to tell me Brown is likely going to be highly owned at $9,800 when there are numerous options priced above and below him that are in better form, I will gladly fade Brown. Tyron Van Aswegen – $8,200  The price on Tyron Van Aswegen just doesn’t line up for me this week, even with the subpar field.
Brown  ->  negative

Lock him into your cash games, but also include him into your GPPs because he has a really high ceiling here. -- Jeff Bergerson  Ryan Moore  Moore has had a fantastic time at Augusta, playing it nine times and only missing the cut twice -- including four top-25s, one of which was last year's T9. He's been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

With a very reasonable price given his recent form and the tournament field, Reavie makes for a great cash game play. Given his recent string of made cuts, this is likely to make Reavie a highly owned player. Although he finished inside of the top 25 over half of his recent appearances he has only finished inside of the top five once.
Reavie  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned. Spieth has played Pebble Beach five times, finishing 22nd, 4th, 7th, 21st, and 1st a year ago.
Spieth  ->  positive

Stay away from Si Woo this week and thank me later. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Smith MC)    Billy Horschel– At 28th in the Ryder Cup Standings, Billy Ho needs a serious late push to join the Team USA squad at Hazeltine in a few weeks. Last week’s t-5th at the Wyndham Championship was a step in the right direction, and I expect for “Ho’s Mo” to continue this week as he makes his debut at Bethpage.
Horschel–  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($9,500 | 16) - Fowler's distance (46th in his past 24 rounds) and off-the-tee play (54th) isn't what you're looking for here, but he's 3rd on par 5s and 1st in birdies in his past 24. Fowler has finished 6th, 16th, and 1st from 2010 to 2012. He was 73rd and 38th in 2013 and 2014 and returned in 2016 to finish 4th.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Despite being fairly indifferent here over the years, it is at least promising that his two best finishes have come on his last four starts, suggesting he has found a way of playing well here. In the lead up to Augusta, Rose had finished T13 at Bay Hill and T15 a week later in Houston, so he has been in great form in recent starts. If he can carry that form over to this week, he could well make an impact at the top of the leaderboard.
Rose  ->  positive

Until he misses a cut or puts in a poor performance, it really is hard to overlook his current run, even in such a big event. Keegan Bradley 80/1 (Skybet 7 places 1/5, SportingBet 5 places 1/4) 1pt e/w:  Much like Reavie, Bradley is a great statistical fit for the event, what’s more, he has course form to boot. In seven starts at Riviera, Bradley has as many top-4 finishes as he does missed cuts (2), and also has two other top-20 finishes to add to the collection.
Bradley  ->  positive

Noren has won five European Tour events in the past year, including the BMW PGA two weeks ago (where he shot a final round 62). Noren is a great ball striker and putter, and shouldn’t be intimidated in this field. He was in contention at the Wells Fargo Championship several weeks ago, as well.
Noren  ->  positive

He’s 7th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, over the past 24 rounds. Jon Rahm ($10,800) has scored the most DK Points over his past 24 rounds. He’s 1st in Strokes Gained: Total and 2nd in Strokes Gained: Approach in that time frame.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Geddit? First selection has to row along with Bozzelli especially after that 13th last time in a good class field at PGA National. His 10th in the St.Jude last year gives further evidence to his ability in these conditions and all that after being very comfortable in front when winning his maiden web.com event.
Bozzelli  ->  positive

The one factor going in his favour this week is that putting doesn’t correlate that strongly with finish positions on Bermudagrass (about 0.20 correlation, vs. 0.45 on Bentgrass). Like Steele, Finau has had some weight behind him this week in the DFS community and will be fairly highly owned. Greg Owen ($6400): Although he’s been around since before the Earth was formed (turned pro in 1992), Greg Owen has been fantastic in every sense of the word this year in getting from tee to green.
Steele,  ->  positive

When finishing 13th in 2015, Rose ranked 6th in SG: Approach and 9th in SG: Tee-to-Green so he struck the ball extremely well and it was just his short game that let him down that week. Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending. In his last two starts, Rose has ranked 29th (Northern Trust) and 3rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Around-the-Green, so his play around the greens seems to coming round at the right time.
Rose  ->  positive

Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
Matthew Fitzpatrick,  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the John Deere Classic - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 22/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Turning the clock back 2 years to 2015, Jordan Spieth won this event in a play-off from Tom Gillis with the very much in-form Danny Lee and Zach Johnson only a shot behind. Spieth was a 4/1 shot, with Zach Johnson at 11/1 and Danny Lee 80/1.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

East Lake is one of those rare tests on the PGA Tour where accuracy from the tee needs to be respected, especially on a course which ranked as the 6th hardest to hit fairways on the Tour across season 2015/16. In terms of ball-striking, the last 7 champions here have ranked - McIlroy 2nd, Spieth 7th, Horschel 9th, Stenson 8th, Snedeker 5th, Haas 3rd and Furyk 3rd, so hitting both fairways and greens here is a pre-requisite for victory. That solid core of play both with tee shots and approach shots is magnified on the basis that East Lake always ranks in the top 15 or so for scrambling difficulty on the PGA Tour.
Spieth  ->  positive

Rickie enters the week as the 11th-ranked golfer in the world and is coming off three solid weeks – Bridgestone is still pending so it’s excluded – with finishes of T22, T3, and T5 before his last missed cut at the St. Jude. Fowler also finished T11 at Augusta, and although he’s yet to win a major his track record with high finishes in majors combined with his track record at Quail Hollow are positive signs. In the last six years at this course, the diminutive candidate for BPTNWAM has won (2012), made the cut with mediocre finishes twice, and finished T4 last year.
Rickie  ->  positive

That fact is backed up by his win at Baltusrol which ticks the won 'Up-State' box. However, for me, Walker will want to build on his PGA Championship success. He grabs me as a level-headed sort who has already won twice in quick succession in his career: 2014: Waialae/Pebble Beach; 2015: Waialae/TPC San Antonio.
Walker  ->  positive

It was nice to see Tommy getting the respect his status in world golf now deserves from the PGA Tour as he was paired up in one of the ‘featured groups’ at Riviera with Phil Mickelson, and as you would expect he had no issues in producing a good performance in the environment that comes with playing in a group with Phil in California and with Tiger in the group just ahead. Tommy’s GIR stats have been off the radar over the past 12 months plus and assuming it is ‘normal service’ from him this week I would expect the test offered by PGA National, particularly this week, to play right to his strengths and I am happy to jump on board the ‘Fleetwood Express’. GRAEME MCDOWELL – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  GMac this week is one of those selections that is so blatantly obvious that if you don’t back him and he performs, you’ll be left scratching your head as why on earth you weren’t on.
Tommy  ->  positive

Cameron Smith's form has just dipped slightly so it's Patrick Cantlay who rates the biggest danger to Matsuyama, as he certainly has the game and the temperament to thrive in the format. Indeed, with Matsuyama's long-game extremely rusty at Bay Hill, it would be the consistent Cantlay who gets the vote to advance and as he's seeded to face Tyrrell Hatton in the last-16, the Californian is worth backing at prices around the 50/1 mark. This is an excellent opportunity to stake a claim for a Ryder Cup place, and we saw last year with Rahm that inexperience need not be a barrier to success.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio. That's the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC, a long par 70 with testing par 4s, and Fowler has cracked the top 10 in his last three appearances there. In short, he would appear to have the perfect game to shine at Muirfield Village.
Fowler  ->  positive

He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money. A winner of the Farmers Insurance Open in January, a course that has seen Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson triumph in the past, Day captured his 11th PGA Tour title and first for 20 months. From there 2nd at Pebble Beach and a competitive 22nd at Bay Hill after a month's inactivity highlight a player who's playing some decent stuff under the radar.
Day  ->  positive

We all know it's coming and this week is a huge opportunity for the Georgia Tech product.

Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.
Koepka  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Steve Stricker  The old man still likes to come over to the PGA Tour from time to time when he's not crushing his competition on the Champions Tour, where he has finished second and first in his past two starts. Stricker still makes his way down to Copperhead, as it is a perfect course for his game, as he has made a career of being one of the most accurate players on tour ... who happens to hit a lot of greens and can still putt as well. He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach.
Steve Stricker  ->  positive

He should go well and I’ll be backing him for a top 10. Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season.
Glover  ->  positive

After adding to his soaring P/L with 200/1 each-way tip Scott Stallings last week, Dave Tindall picks out three bets for the PGA Tour's Genesis Open in California...  "A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

FedEx Cup champion Justin Thomas is looking for three straight wins in the CIMB Classic at TPC Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this week. Justin Thomas has won the last two editions of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the USPGA champion will be looking to become the first player on the PGA Tour to win a tournament three years running since Steve Stricker achieved that feat in the John Deere Classic between 2009 and 2011. A limited field of 78 players will tee it up at TPC Kuala Lumpur with Justin Thomas and World Number 3 Hideki Matsuyama the star attractions.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Aaron Wise  ->  positive

Branden Grace withdrawing after the first round definitely beat up a number of otherwise promising cash lines as well. Poor Sunday performances by Kisner (77), CH3 (74), and RCB (74) further dinged our cash hopes, but fortunately a huge performance by the constantly underrated Gary Woodland along with solid showings by Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Brendan Steele, and a few of our hedge plays buoyed a number of subscribers to a positive ROI, including myself. I’d also like to extend a special congratulations for Scott P. on a pretty sizable GPP hit this week as well – nice work buddy!
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

If it does this week, Steele could easily take on this loaded field and come out with the big check. James Hahn $7,100 – To say, “Hahn enjoys the West Coast swing,” may be the understatement of the year. In his 6th event in a row, Hahn arrives at Riviera having gained 33 strokes on the field in his last six tournaments.
Hahn  ->  positive

These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. This week’s OWGR chart has some very interesting standouts this week, one of whom is Wesley Bryan who’s official world golf ranking is 40th in the world despite his sub $7k price tag. Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place.
Bryan  ->  positive

He suffered a dip in form, following his win in Hawaii, finishing T42 at the CareerBuilder, T31 in Phoenix and missing the cut at the Honda but has hopefully put that behind him now. A T12 finish in Mexico last time out, following a closing round of 66 was a welcome return to form for Kizzire and he will look to put his strengths to good use this week. Kizzire ranks 11th in Par 5 Scoring Average and T19 in SG: Putting this season, and ranked similarly in Mexico.
Kizzire  ->  positive

The course has undergone regular changes in recent times and Palmer's aim was for it to play like a US Open course from the tee but like a Masters on and around the greens. As a US Open winner with a superb record at Augusta National, it's fairly logical while Rose should enjoy it so much. Speaking last year, Rose said: "It reminds me of the Memorial which happens to be Jack's tournament.
Rose  ->  positive

Mickelson has not played the event since 2013 and failed to make the cut in all three goes but needs to get going again somewhere following a short break and we know he likes to play himself into form with competitive rounds as the Open Championship gets closer. He starts as 22/1 chance but I would rather break the mould for once and take some 16/1 about market leader Patrick Reed. Rather like Watson, Reed’s game can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other with some brilliant attacking golf at the US Open immediately followed by error-strewn clumsiness.
Reed.  ->  positive

6th at the 2012 Callaway Pebble Beach Invitational, he also finished 3rd here in his rookie 2013 PGA Tour season where he led after 54 holes. Confident with the putter right now, we know that Hahn can win on the classical courses like Riviera and Quail Hollow. He also has a great reason to be motivated this week: Hahn struggles in Florida, so at Number 60 in the OWGR, if he wants to get into The Masters it's pretty much now or Riviera next week.
Hahn  ->  positive

Kirk has finished no worse than 15th at Colonial in the past three years, winning the event in 2015. Kirk hasn’t missed a cut at this event in his last six starts, and his 68.6 Course Adj Rd Score ranks fourth among golfers with more than one start at this track. Kirk had struggled this season, but he finished 12th in his last time out at THE PLAYERS Championship.
Kirk  ->  positive

Per FantasyGolfMetrics, DJ ranks 4th in strokes gained: tee to green and 1st off the tee over the past 12 weeks. Jordan Spieth ($12,000 | 12) - Spieth bounced back from a missed cut two weeks ago to finish 20th at Pebble Beach last week. At Riviera, Spieth's past four include three top 25s (12th, 4th, 22nd) and a missed cut in 2016.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Peterson & Loupe at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) - locals who also look a nice blend at their best  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Spurred on perhaps by the innovation of the European Tour, combined with substandard fields and poor TV figures, the Zurich Classic of New Orleans and PGA Tour officials have conjured up a new team format which can already be called a success. In its former guise, the Zurich Classic did produce the odd high-profile winner – Bubba Watson and Justin Rose among the more notables – but it had essentially become an opportunity for a lesser-light to secure their breakthrough, such as when Brian Stuard outlasted Jamie Lovemark and Byeong-hun An in a Monday play-off one year ago. Now a two-man team event with 80 pairs set to tee off, organisers have been rewarded with a star-studded field headed by Jason Day and Rickie Fowler, who marginally top the market from Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, set to renew their Ryder Cup partnership at a course Rose knows well.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

He ranks 18th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 1st in Strokes Gained Approach, 7th in Proximity, 15th and 10th in Par 4 & 5 Scoring and 9th in Birdie or Better %. Patrick Reed  Vegas Odds - 16/1  Draftkings - $9,700  FantasyAces - $5,700  While he isn't quite the amazing value he was at the Barclays when he started the playoffs at $8,800 on DraftKings, he is still a terrific value under $10K this week. He sits first in the standings after his win to open the playoffs and backed that up with a T5 last week at the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card. When he is on, he hits greens as well as anyone on tour.
Wagner  ->  positive

Beyond the names we’ve watched for two months now, there’s a slew of players setting down in North America for the first time in 2018. Euros Ross Fisher, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Joost Luiten, Jorge Campillo and Paul Dunne are in the field. As is Australasian Tour money leader Brett Rumford, along with countrymen Wade Ormsby and Adam Bland.
Joost Luiten,  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Jordan Spieth 5/1 1pt EW  Patrick Reed 11/1 1pt EW  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Brandt Snedeker 18/1 1pt EW  Total staked = 8 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter – @DoublebogeyDB6  Facebook – www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 18/1 seems quite generous for a player bang in form with a great record here. He is putting very well lately ranking 15th in strokes gained putting, sixth in par 4 scoring and first in par 4 birdie or better leaders.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

What I like most is the value price this week as he comes in the low $8K range on DraftKings and the mid $9K range on FanDuel making him a top target in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Tommy Fleetwood  World Golf Ranking (#11)  Vegas Odds (18/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($11,300)    Before coming over to the PGA Tour in mid-February, Tommy Fleetwood was on fire in Europe posting three straight finishes of 6th or better including a win at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. During those three events, he also recorded 12 straight rounds in the 60's.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar ($9,000) – A lack of length can be detrimental to some, but it’s virtually never a problem for Kuch. Kuchar has played here sparingly, but outside of one poor finish in 2015, he’s managed two T8 finishes and a runner-up since 2010. He’s the epitome of course management and has been rock solid steady for the vast majority of this year.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times. Obviously, he wasn't stating an exact number, the idea remains the same as Streelman, he will be very comfortable sleeping in his own bed this week. Has a pair of top 20s in two of his five starts here, so he's still a bit boom-or-bust.
Streelman,  ->  positive

I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
Stenson  ->  negative

Berger’s feasted on these simple courses recently, with a win and a playoff loss in his past two non-US Open events. There’s no reason to fade him here… Harman’s a former champ of this event, with four Top 10s in his past eight starts, and rates out among the best in the field form 125-175 yards. These two with be very chalky picks, so if you want to risk it and go contrarian to gain points on your completion, I suggest Ben Martin, Kelly Kraft, Nick Taylor or David Hearn.
Harman’s  ->  positive

The Australian might not be a household name, but he's a former PGA Tour rookie of the year, who now has three high-profile wins worldwide, including an impressive one in the Nedbank Challenge and another at Bay Hill last month. The latter was particularly noteworthy in that Leishman at last grabbed an opportunity with both hands, making clutch par saves on the final two holes to win by one in an important, poignant renewal of a high-profile event, securing a win which had in truth been long overdue. All of which sets him up for another big major run, and that's something Leishman is very familiar with.
Leishman  ->  positive

Ancer should be comfortable with the culture and language spoke on the property this week.
DJ  ->  positive

Casey has certainly performed well at other longer par 71 and 72 venues, such as Riviera and the Houston Golf Club, and there’s little reason to think Quail’s tougher layout won’t be a good fit for him. From a fantasy perspective, Casey also ranks as one of the better values this week as his $7,800 salary is the lowest it’s been since the Masters; this is despite his streak of constantly returning value, week in week out on DraftKings. Sometimes persistence pays off, and Casey is certainly someone who I could see breaking through at an event in which five of the last seven champions have been first-time major winners.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world. Day doesn’t have the strongest history here (two MCs and a 64th), but the last time he played this event was way back in 2012 and given the layoff I wouldn’t put too much stock in his shaky course history. While he hasn’t shown dominant form yet in 2017, Day put in three great rounds at Pebble and this could easily be the week he puts the hammer down and distances himself from the field.
Day  ->  positive

He was matched at [690.0] in-running and he was quoting as saying "I quite simply had nothing out there" after round one so Tommy did well to close with rounds of 67 and 66 to climb up to 14th given no other Honda contenders shone. In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

Dave Tindall is back to preview this week's PGA Tour event in North Carolina...  "A player getting to contest an event where he’s a member can often be a red herring but in Simpson’s case I don’t think it is." Each-way terms: 1/4 odds, 5 places      It's not as difficult a puzzle to solve as last week's Zurich Classic of New Orleans - did anyone, anywhere back Jonas Blixt and Cameron Smith?! - but the switch to a brand new course makes this year's Wells Fargo much trickier than usual.
Simpson’s  ->  positive

For a regular tour event, this field is stacked. Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Throw in a couple of solid finishes at the PRO in the past, and you’ve got one of my picks to win. Chris Kirk ($9,100) – Kirk has missed back-to-back cuts on tough tracks, and now comes to an easy course in a weak field. This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one.
Kirk  ->  positive

Made 4 bets so far: Ollie 50/1 Hadley 50/1 Moore 66/1 Bryan 150/1 (a sprinkle - will be more of a T20 bet)
Hadley  ->  positive

Justin Rose - $16,600    The 2016 Masters runner-up has been a world-class ball striker for years, but a below-average putter has limited Rose to just one career major victory. With rain in the forecast throughout the week, Erin Hills’ greens are projected to soften up a bit, lessening the margin between Rose and those who usually maintain a putting advantage. He’s top 10 on Tour in SG: off-the-tee and fifth in par-four scoring, and is priced a whole $1,300 cheaper than Jason Day.
Rose  ->  positive

Final selections –  Brandt Snedeker 20/1 1pt EW  Phil Mickelson 20/1 0.5pts EW  Jon Rahm 22/1 0.5pts EW  Patrick Reed 33/1 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on social media –  Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/doublebogey6/  Twitter – www.twitter.com/doublebogeyDB6 Reed is a bit streaky lately but could be worth a risk here with his previous record. Statswise his game looks to really suit this course ranking sixth in SG around the green, fifth in SGP and 32nd in SGTTG.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

He makes great salary relief for DJ, and could find himself with a top-25 this week. John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards).
John Huh  ->  positive

Kevin Chappell;  ->  positive

He’s accurate off the tee and rarely ends up in any deep trouble, missing both the fairway and rough 2.26% of the time (14 ), and just needs a few decent rounds with the putter to contend. Russell Henley ($7100) : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Thomas Pieters ($7300): Pieters has had an excellent track record at WGCs, finishing 23rd/14th/5th in his only attempts, and absolutely stripes the ball. That distance will help him make up the few times where he can get wild off the tee, and it’s really on approach where Pieters’ true talents show out. He’s gained 1.6 strokes on approach over his last five PGA events, and has had a bit of a mixed bag in Europe during that time – finishing T13 at the French Open and T14 at the BMW PGA Championship, but also missing the cut at the Irish Open and a mediocre finish at Birkdale given his expectations as a long hitter.
Pieters  ->  positive

And while there are no guarantees that trend continues, the extra public humiliation Peterson put on himself, and the fact he finished T11 at TPC San Antonio back in 2015, suggests it might. In a weak field, Peterson is definitely a player you can consider on DraftKings as his past record, and propensity for quick bounce backs lines him up for a potentially big week. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Peterson  ->  positive

Russell Knox has lost his way of late but given he was third (when favourite!) last year and second in 2015, I thought [80.0] was just too big and my last two are big outsiders that I backed last year - Brian Stuard and Fabián Gómez. The latter is little more than a hopeful punt on someone who should like the course but I really like Stuard.
Stuard  ->  positive

Playing in a home game, perhaps we'll finally see Ancer ring the bell in terms of reaching his potential. Looking at my Web Rankings of this year's graduates, Ancer ranked 4th of all graduates in strokes gained across all tours in 2017. The top 8 on that list in 2016 all retained their tour cards this season, meaning we should see Ancer pop eventually.
Ancer  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($9,000 | 18/1) - Rickie always has big ownership, but it's justified because he either fits the course well or is playing well or has played at that particular course well. Fowler has finished top-10 (10th, 10th, 8th) in the past three years at this event and was 2nd back in 2011. He was 2nd at the Memorial, cut at the St. Jude, 5th at the U.S. Open, 3rd at the Quicken Loans, 9th at the Scottish Open, and 22nd at The Open.
Rickie  ->  positive

That's relevant as seventh, or indeed eighth, would be enough to get the place money at 16s if Johnson, Spieth and McIlroy - all World No.1s at some point in very recent times - finished in front of him. The dream outcome would be Garcia finishing solo fourth behind Johnson, Spieth and McIlroy, allowing us to be paid out on him as a full 16/1 winner rather than getting just the place money at 7s if we'd taken him at 28s on the full outright market. It looks highly likely that Sergio will like what he sees in Mexico and there should be much love coming the Spaniard's way from the local fans who he'll be able to converse with in his native tongue.
Sergio  ->  positive

Ogilvy comes into North Carolina on the back of three top-30 finishes in his last four starts and he’s had success when he’s made the trek to North Carolina in the past, having made the cut in 10 out of 11 appearances at this event. Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well. While he’s more of a GPP play, Ogilvy is a player you can target given his improved recent form (13th overall in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green at the Valero) and affinity for this event/region.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  Price: $12,000  It's fair to assume Spieth will be the least owned of the top three options this week. Not only is he the most expensive player in the field, but Justin Thomas has won his last two tournaments, while Hideki Matsuyama has finished first, second and fourth in his three appearances at this tournament. While I would probably go with one of them in cash games, I like Spieth, who placed seventh in his only other trip to TPC Scottsdale in 2015, has quietly finished third in back-to-back tournaments and ranks first in GIR percentage, as a contrarian pick in GPP and tournament formats.
Spieth  ->  positive

The time off to heal his back has seemed to helped his short game as he ranks 24th in scrambling this season. Rose is always a threat in less than normal conditions and this week is just that. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  We were high on Phil in Phoenix last week and he got it within two strokes of the lead making the turn on Sunday before posting a four-over 40 on the back nine to finish 16th.
Rose  ->  positive

Lee has made seven straight cuts this year. When Lee last played this event in 2015, he finished in third place. Lee is above average in each Birdie or Better category and is 36th overall in 2017.
Lee  ->  positive

Here are my picks for 2017 Northern Trust. Jason Day 20/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds) 2 pts e/w:  Jason Day looks to have found some consistency again and when that happens it is time to stand up and take notice. Day is still win-less so far this season, however he has twice gone close finishing 2nd at the AT&T Byron Nelson and T5 at Pebble Beach earlier in the year.
Day  ->  positive

Something tells me he puts four rounds together this week and finds the top 10. Fade: Bubba Watson. Just not the same player he once was.
Bubba Watson.  ->  negative

But you only have to drop six points to find Marc Leishman at 22/1 and I just think he's far more likely to challenge and outperform all the elite names on show. The Aussie already has four top sixes in majors (Harman and Perez have one each) and three of those have come in the Open Championship - the best test of creativity and excelling in the wind. Leishman also beat stellar fields last season to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational and BMW Championship (third leg of the FedEx Cup play-offs).
(Harman  ->  positive

Kisner  ->  positive

The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day. In the shorter term though I feel a big week could be in the offing for him at the Valspar.
Moore  ->  positive

By setting a lay order to partially cash out should he shorten up in-play, a similar scenario could still yield a profit. Winner of last year's Memorial Tournament, 37-year-old McGirt seems to be perennially under-rated and written off far too quickly by the market. Having contended for three rounds on his penultimate start, odds of [160.0] are surely an over-reaction to missing the following cut at Pebble Beach.
McGirt  ->  positive

Major-less Matsuyama is an almost perfect fit too (T4 in last year's US PGA, aged 25, world-ranked 3rd, a two-time winner this year, runner-up in the US Open and a five-shot champ at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday). He's also got good course form with T11 on his last visit but Fowler's previous win at Quail Hollow suggests he's the most powerful stats fit. Rickie gets the nod but the stats are certainly with anyone backing Matsuyama also.
Fowler's  ->  positive

Last year, the local Wilmington Star newspaper said described Haas as a "frequent visitor". With Haas, it goes beyond just the local affiliation. He's shown plenty of good form this season, highlighted by his third place at the WGC-Dell Match Play in Texas at the end of March.
Haas  ->  positive

Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

I love him this week. MID TIER  Matt Kuchar ($8,700) – No matter where he is, no matter what the course demands, Matt Kuchar finds a way. It’s truly incredible.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Also noteworthy is the fact that he has won immediately after one of these major near-misses, albeit again in modest company out in Malaysia, while he's been second at Augusta and fourth at Firestone to tick those correlating course boxes. Oosthuizen ranked second in strokes-gained tee-to-green in the PGA Championship where he also putted better than the field average every day, so if able to pick up where he left off rates a big player in his bid to finally win on US soil. While Oosthuizen is already secure on the International Presidents Cup team, Ryan Moore needs to produce right now if he's to earn a debut for the United States.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD  ->  positive

Spieth ranks 22nd on tour in that range and was 10th before struggling with the new greens at the Players. Backing up his putting, Spieth ranks 2nd in BA and BoB% and he comes in 6th in Par 4 Scoring. Coming off missed cuts in two of his last three events, we may get Spieth at reduced ownership this week, which makes him a great play in GPPs.
Spieth  ->  positive

That leaves plenty of room for boom-or-bust options at the bottom. Wise, Hossler, and Burns are all youngsters with top-10 potential while Woods is just too cheap still. Editor’s Note : With over 15,000 reviews, DRAFT is the highest rated fantasy sports app.
Wise,  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $11900 – Spieth led the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green last season, and though he’s fallen short of expectation, this week represents opportunity for the young star. Spieth was T12 last season here and appears to be finding his putter just in time to tame the tricky greens at Club de Golf Chapultepec.

Rose rates out near the top of every single stat, has nine top 10s in his past 11 starts, and has gone P2/T10/T2/T14 the last four years at Augusta National. Adam Scott  The 2013 Masters champ took most of the first two months off from competitive play, and since his return at Pebble Beach, the results have been rather middling — MC/T53/T13/T16/T41.

Spieth,  ->  positive

His birdie or better rank is right in the middle, but he’s coming off a performance at Kapalua where he dropped 20 birdies for the week. Ben Martin ($6,900) – Ben Martin is my sleeper pick for the week, although, some other DFS players may be on to him after his T 7 finish last week in the Sony Open. Martin has shot in the 60s for seven straight competitive rounds; nothing to sneeze at regardless of the course difficulty.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

Unlike last week in Augusta National, you don’t need to be long on this course so a lot of the shorter more accurate players should come into the mix. Russell Henley 25/1  Henley is in fine form lately and comes to Harbour Town with a win and three top 11’s in his last four starts. He had a great week at the Valspar posting a T9 which included an opening round 64.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

. Mr. Spieth If You’re Nasty  Jordan Spieth ($11,500) is the only other player in the field with odds to win greater than 10 percent this week: He’s currently at 11.1 percent. Spieth’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score and 17.0 LT Adj Bird Avg are both second this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama went off 12/1 for the last major championship  That has to be taken on board, and he was never in the mix at Bay Hill on his return, but three rounds at the Match Play will have helped speed up his recovery and he showed much better signs in all of them, particularly from tee-to-green. After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He played in this tournament last year, and if it weren’t for an opening round 76, his T55 finish would look much, much better. What is different from last year, is that Noren was not playing nearly as much as he has been in 2018, making his results from last year tough to compare. I’m all in and Noren is a lock for cash.
Noren  ->  positive

The same aspects that made Lefty a good play last week when he was written up (T22 finish) are in play here:  14 th in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 8 th in Approach 50-125, 49 th in 150-175  in Approach 50-125, 49 in 150-175 23 rd in SG: Around the Green  in SG: Around the Green 10 th in Putting Average  in Putting Average 9th in Birdie or Better %  Look for him to try to take the W before skipping the U.S. Open for his daughter’s graduation, and he’ll almost need it to pay off that salary hit. Chez Reavie ($6400): Reavie is another golfer with stellar historical Strokes Gained data, although in a smaller sampler than Phil – he’s only played the course twice since 2012, finished T11 and T27, but en route to those finishes he averaged 2.5 SG:P and 1.17 SG:Tee to Green. He’s a riskier play as he enters the week in terrible form, but as Si Woo Kim and Billy Horschel have shown recently, form is not the be all and end all.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

I'm sure a win this week, leaving a tilt at the FedEx Cup, 2017 Player of the Year and World Number 1 spot in Atlanta next week, will be a huge motivator. RESULT: T7  Marc Leishman 1.25pt EW 45/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  We have seen lesser names surprise at this stage with Billy Horschel doing amazingly well at TPC Boston in 2014, before ultimately losing a title he probably should have won.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday.
Stroud,  ->  positive

Local ties have been important here in the past with the likes of Bowditch and Jimmy Walker taking the title, and they point towards Tom Hoge perhaps going better than many expect. Hoge is a strong iron player who, like Landry, fell down the leaderboard last week having played nicely throughout the first three days, something we saw earlier in the year when he produced his best-ever finish on the PGA Tour in taking third at the Sony Open. Rather than back the former Texas Christian graduate outright, I'd rather take heed of those regular fast starts of his and back him in the first-round leader market.
Landry,  ->  positive

Other: David Lipsky (coming off 2nd place finish, has won at altitude before)  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Gary Woodland, Paul Casey, Martin Kaymer, Louis Oosthuizen  – Thomas Pieters, Pablo Larrazabal, Alex Noren, Danny Willett, David Lipsky, Ben An, Jason Dufner  Good luck with your DraftKings WGC Mexico Championship lineups and picks, and make sure you’re checking back on our Golf Picks section to get Keagan and Alex’s picks that will be posted by Tuesday evening. He’s played great at the Omega Masters over the years (won there in 2015 and runner-up in 2012) so can definitely handle the altitude shift. Don’t forget that he finished T5 in his second last start and won’t have to deal with questions about fan behavior here; and that should help him get out of his own head this week.
Noren,  ->  positive

He is going to be popular(2nd most tagged on FanShare at this point) this week, especially on DraftKings under the $9K mark but makes a high upside play safe in all formats. Hideki Matsuyama  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,700)  FanDuel ($9,600)  Hideki has one more year of experience here at TPC Sawgrass but very similar form as Thomas and has also gotten better each year. Despite shooting no rounds under 70 in 2014, he was very consistent through four rounds and finished T23.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

He can ride those same skills to victory here. Spieth won this event by 10 in 2014 a week after taking victory in the Australian Open. He's just won that event for a second time after hitting some clutch shots when it really mattered so the omens and practicalities (dealing with jet-lag, the ability to win back-to-back) point to another at an Albany course where he was fourth on debut last year.
Spieth  ->  positive

European Tour's Race to Dubai will return soon. Golf Channel (PlayFantasyGolf.com)      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”    Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Marc Leishman ($28,100)  Pat Perez ($22,900)  Wesley Bryan ($5,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Austin Cook ($2,500)    Analysis: Going to ride the course horse (Spieth) and current form (Leishman). The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth (10,600)  One of the odd things about this event is that we see top players at the lowest salaries we may have seen them at all year. Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week. Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs.
Spieth  ->  positive

Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016. For a player who hits it as long as Woodland, his ranking of 59th in scrambling is very underrated.
Woodland  ->  positive

He’s arguably the world’s best off the tee on a course that rewards long and accurate driving. Rickie Fowler, $9000 – Fowler has showed a knack for Firestone with four top-10 finishes in just seven career starts. Since June, Fowler has racked up three top-5 finishes and a 22nd at the Open two weeks back.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

At this price he looks a great low ownership GPP play. The Fade:  Scott Piercy ($9,800) – Piercy has played well recently, but having performed when almost 20% owned last week, I feel like he’s going to be heavily owned again. With this track more focused on accuracy, I’m not convinced he can perform as well this week.
Scott Piercy  ->  negative

He brings good upside for a cheaper price tag and is a solid target this week in DFS. My Sleeper: Ben Martin ($6,900)  Martin quietly put together four solid rounds last week, finishing his week off with a 65 and a T7 finish. This was the second solid finish in a row for Martin, who also finished T22 in his penultimate start at the RSM Classic.
Martin  ->  positive

To recover from a 77 with a closing 70 to finish T9 was a fair effort and that top 10 built on previous finishes of T24 (WGC-Bridgestone) and T27 (Open Championship) so he's clearly coming back to life after a dip. Talking at Quail Hollow after a second-round 66, Day explained: "There were signs coming from Royal Birkdale; there were signs coming from last week in Akron. Being able to piece it together is difficult, because the driving and the putting has been lagging behind.
Day  ->  positive

He let us down last week with just a top-40, but the price remains low. Jimmy Walker ($8,500 | 110) - Walker is nothing more than a dice roll at his price. He's 125th in the field in strokes gained: tee to green over the past 12 and is still working his way back after being diagnosed with Lyme disease.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row. Not only can Haas dominate the Par 3’s, he is also top 20 in SG: Tee to Green.
Haas  ->  positive

Remember that a 120-man field yields a higher chance at making the cut, so there’s a bit more comfortability when selecting fliers in GPP formats with the lowest score on a roster being dropped. Past Champions    *Not held at TPC Potomac    2016 - Billy Hurley III  2015 - Troy Merritt  2014 - Justin Rose  2013 - Bill Haas  2012 - Tiger Woods  2011 - Nick Watney  2010 - Justin Rose    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Rickie Fowler - $19,100    Selecting the most-expensive player paid off last week as Jordan Spieth won the Travelers Championship, and there’s good reason to back the betting favorite again this week. Fowler ranks first on Tour in total driving, 12th in SG: Approach, and seventh in SG: Putting, and his elite all-around skill set is tough to pass up against below-average competition.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

284 yards (17th), 69.6% fairways (60th), 72.2% greens in regulation (33rd), proximity to hole 28'9" (16th), 65.0 % scrambling (32nd), 1.54 putts per GIR (1st). 2014, Brian Harman (-22). 303 yards (18th), 80.4% fairways (8th), 87.5% greens in regulation (1st), proximity to hole 23'3" (2nd), 66.7 % scrambling (29th), 1.70 putts per GIR (31st).
Brian Harman  ->  positive

With excellent current form and a razor sharp game DJ looks like the man to beat here. Jon Rahm 28/1  This guy is a serious player and comes here in great form with a win, two top 10’s and a top 20 in his last five starts. Rahm played well at the World Cup of Golf back in December finishing T8 on 13 under par in total.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Some courses are just going to be too big for him, but a place like Copperhead is where he can thrive, evidenced by his playoff runner-up finish last year. Graham DeLaet ($8,400) – Don’t look now, but DeLaet is starting to regain his PGA Tour relevance at a very rapid pace. With top 20 finishes at Phoenix, Riviera, and PGA National, DeLaet is clearly returning to form as one of the best ball strikers in the game, even if his scrambling and putting still aren’t quite up to snuff.
DeLaet  ->  positive

DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Chesson Hadley ($10,100)  Many casual golf fans still don’t know the name Chesson Hadley, but they should. Coming off a multi-win season on the web.com Tour, Hadley stormed to a runner-up finish at last week’s Sanderson Farms. Because he’s had PGA Tour status before, he’s played TPC Summerlin numerous times.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Other: Jason Kokrak  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Bud Cauley, Daniel Berger, Louis Oosthuizen, Lucas Glover, Michael Thompson, Harold Varner III, William McGirt, Jon Rahm, Kevin Kisner  – Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Geoff Ogilvy, Jason Kokrak, Emiliano Grillo, Hudson Swafford  Bets If the new course plays anything like the old one Ogilvy could surprise here, he’s made 10 of 11 cuts at the Wells Fargo and has generally handled longer par 72’s like Eagle Point well over his career. The Aussie has shown some form of late though with three finishes of T32 or better in his last four starts, and tee to green he’s been above average lately, as evidenced by his 16th ranking in that category for the week at the Valero.
Bill Haas,  ->  positive

It's hard to do justice to how big an achievement that would be for a player who was returning from years out of the game, playing on a medical and well outside the world's top 1000 back in January. And while glowing praise around his achievements doesn't mean much in relation to this event, Cantlay would be a top-40 player in birdie average terms had he played enough rounds to qualify, and his no-weakness, all-round game seems ideally suited to a course which has thrown up all kinds of players. Cantlay shot 60 when playing in the Travelers Championship as an amateur back in 2011 so his adaptability and scoring prowess is not in question and he does actually have some experience of Conway Farms, having played in the Western Amateur here back in 2009.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Top 5 Finishes So Far This Season  1st – Aaron Wise – $8,800 – Byron Nelson – Week 20  1st – Jason Day – $9,400 – Farmers Insurance – Week 4  1st – Bubba Watson – $8,200 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  2nd – Patrick Reed – $7,700 – Valspar Championship – Week 10  2nd – Chez Reavie – $8,000 – AT&T – Week 6  2nd – Adrian Otaugui – $7,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Lucas Herbert – $7,100 – Rocco Forte Open – Week 19  3rd – Brandon Steele – $7,800 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  3rd – Alex Noren – $8,700 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  3rd – Jorge Campillo – $8,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Emiliano Grillo – $8,600 – Fort Worth Invitational – Week 21  4th – Seungsu Han – $7500 – Oman Open – Week 7  5th – Chris Paisley – $7,400 – Dubai Desert Classic – Week 4  5th – Phil Mickelson – $8,700 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  5th – Seungsu Han – $8,500 – Corales Puntacana Championship – Week 12  5th – Webb Simpson – $9,400 – RBC Heritage – Week 15  5th – Jorge Campillo – $8,500 – Espana De Open – Week 15  5th – Phil Mickelson – $9,200 – Wells Fargo – Week 18  Euro Tour Picks sponsored by Golf Predictor – for all your DFS stats for both the European & US PGA Tours.

Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Nothing stands out statistically for Ancer, but his all-round game is clearly in solid shape right now and his recent experiences and form will certainly help him here. Ancer ranked 4th at the Valspar and 30th at the Houston Open in Par 5 Scoring Average for the week, and if he performs on the “scoring holes” as well as he did at the Valspar, here this week, his chances will look all the better come Sunday. He did play here back in 2016, making the weekend and eventually finishing T42 but he will be hoping for a much better showing this time around.
Ancer,  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Fed Ex St Jude Classic - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brooks Koepka 2pts EW 12/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Last week we had Rickie Fowler on board to contend for the title at The Memorial on the basis that he tends to perform well pre-Major. I was surprised to hear on Thursday that he'd added TPC Southwind to his schedule at the last minute and he probably regrets it now after a very strong outing in Ohio.
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.
Jim Furyk  ->  negative

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Still only 23, the man from Brisbane was runner-up at his home Australian Open in November after losing in a three-way playoff to Jordan Spieth no less. Smith had made it to extra holes after shooting a final-round 66 after starting the final day five back. The consolation prize was a spot in this summer's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and look out for him there too.
Smith  ->  positive

Hudson Swafford and Jon Rahm registered on the West Coast Swing claiming the CareerBuilder Challenge and Farmers Insurance Open before Canadian Adam Hadwin broke into the winner's circle with victory at the Valspar Championship in Florida. In Europe, Tommy Fleetwood won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship before a runner-up finish to Dustin Johnson at the WGC-Mexico Championship which guaranteed his ticket to Augusta. South Korean Jeunghun Wang landed the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters to make it three European Tour titles since May 2016.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

Charl Schwartzel took the title in a playoff last year and I fancy the person he beat to go one better this time. Bill Haas was leading going into the final round but couldn’t quite hold off the South African and is looking for redemption this week. The good news is that Haas returns in excellent form.
Haas  ->  positive

The 27th-ranked player in the OWGR posted a T3 result at the WGC-Mexico Championship last year when he finished top-five among the field in both GIR percentage and SG: Putting. Throughout the Euro Tour’s 2017 season, Fisher ranked fourth in GIR percentage and ended sixth in the Race to Dubai. Bargain Bin    Kevin Chappell - $14,100    Not a bad price for someone who ranks fourth on Tour in SG: Tee-to-Green and 10th in scrambling, but he’ll need to improve with the flat stick in order to have any shot at winning this week.
Fisher  ->  positive

Like McGirt, he also has some eye-catching post-major form away from his performances here. Cauley placed after both the Open and the US PGA in 2012, while earlier this year he was a solid ninth in the RBC Heritage just after the Masters. Indeed, in terms of world ranking points, 10 of his best 20 finishes have come either a week before, a week after or during the week of a major championship, so the timing of the Travelers is ideal for him.
Cauley  ->  positive

DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th. Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

He currently has the highest Vegas odds to win and carries the highest salary on both DraftKings and FanDuel. Fowler is also one of the top gofers in all eight of our Player Models. Fowler’s 68.4 Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) and 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score both rank second overall this week, and he is tied for eighth in the field with his 62.2 LT SC percentage.
Fowler  ->  positive

Brian Harman ($11,500) may be the hottest golfer on the planet right now: He’s finished no worse than fourth in his two tournaments in 2018 and he hasn’t finished outside of the top 10 in his last five tournaments. Harman is also Hump’s pick to win, which means he’ll likely shoot an 85 on Thursday and withdraw from the tournament. Harman is tied for 10th with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score, while his 67.6 Recent Adj Rd Score and 79.2 Recent GIR percentage both lead the field among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
Leishman  ->  positive

Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Rory McIlroy: 42nd BMW/1st Deutsche/31st Barclays/MC PGA. Jordan Spieth: 13th BMW/MC Deutsche/MC Barclays/2nd PGA. Billy Horschel: 1st BMW/2nd Deutsche/MC Barclays/47th Wyndham.
Jordan Spieth:  ->  positive

Spain's Jon Rahm continues to impress but he's making his Sawgrass debut this week and only Hal Sutton (1983) and Craig Perks (2002) have won The Players at the first attempt. Selections    Russell Henley has already won twice in Florida and he's been in fine fettle this year, winning the Shell Houston Open and finishing 11th at the US Masters. His form figures here read a fairly uninspiring MC-17-24-MC but he sat second after round one and third at halfway in 2014 when he finished 17th so he's been in-the-mix here before.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

He is also 26th or better in GIR from 150-175, 175-200 and 200+ yards. BOTTOM TIER TARGET ($6K/$7K RANGE)  Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports  Russell Knox ($7,100)  The chalk is clearly falling on Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Adam Scott, and Jhonattan Vegas in this range which gives us a few GPP pivot options. I start with Knox as he come sback to TPC Boston with a nice record finishing T26, T12, T15 in his only three trips here.
Knox  ->  positive

RESULT: T44  I'll also have a dabble with a couple of longer shots at a tournament where we know crazy winners can and do happen:  Ryan Palmer 0.5pt EW 150/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Texan Ryan Palmer loves a home game and despite a very poor period of play he ranks 7th in this week's Published Predictor Model. Palmer, who co-led at PGA National after 36 holes last time out, loves to play in his home state: top 5s and top 10s abound for Ryan across TPC San Antonio, TPC Four Seasons and his home course of Colonial. Statistically Palmer sits 9th in Going for the Green and 48th in Proximity from 150 to 175 yards, which are 2 key statistics for the GC of Houston.
Ryan  ->  positive

Henley sits fifth in SG Approach and tenth in DK points in his last eight rounds at Kapalau. Look for Henley to continue to build on last year. Kevin Chappell, 7700: Chappell comes off a rough Hero, but that was due to a rough weekend.
Henley  ->  positive

FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10200 – The world’s ninth-ranked player heads the field and represents a good value after a week of rest following his recent top-5 finish at the U.S. Open. Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form.
Fowler,  ->  positive

I'm e/w on Reed, Knox &amp; Simpson in Phoenix this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
Reed,  ->  positive

Another guy to watch on Fanshare, but I can’t see him above 25% with all the names above him. Rickie Fowler $10,700 – He has a win at Quail in 2012 and a 4th in 2016. I think he figured something out last week after a bit of a letdown at The Open.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
Reed  ->  positive

Maybe he is looking for some guidance this week, whatever it is, I really do believe Horschel can bounce back from the missed cut last week, with a huge week here at Bay Hill. Brooks Koepka 100/1 (StanJames 6 places + Betway, William Hill and Ladbrokes) 0.5pt e/w:  From one golfer who needs some help to another, I also think Brooks Koepka is worth a bet at the same price as Horschel. Koepka has been in dismal form in 2017, finishing no better than his T42 at the Phoenix Open so far, so why am I backing him this week?
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

He showed some decent form with a pair of top 15s in Florida but missed cuts on his last two starts are negatives and overall I'll look elsewhere. Justin Thomas and Bud Cauley could go well and were close to getting the nod. Thomas needs no introduction after his three wins this season but the extra positives are a T12 on his only start at the Zurich Classic and a strong weekend at Augusta National (T22).
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices. My mind goes back to Augusta Sunday when Justin Rose was in the middle of the 13th fairway with a 2-shot lead and Sergio Garcia was taking a penalty drop.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

However, if Uihlein is going to pick up a PGA Tour win in the 2017-2018 season, the fall swing season seems like an ideal time to get the job done. Ollie Schniederjans – $8,300  Similar to Uihlein, Ollie Schniederjans has to be one of the favourites to pick up his first career win in the fall swing series. Ollie had a great 2017 season, although it didn’t end quite as well as he had hoped.
Uihlein  ->  positive

But it's been a trend in recent years for players to get hot and stay hot and Justin Thomas has already reminded us of that with his back-to-back wins in Hawaii. It's probably too premature to put Swafford in that bracket but it makes sense to leave some chips on the table and back him here as this really is an excellent fit for the Georgia Bulldog. Swafford smashes it a mile (he's been 5th and 1st in Driving Distance on his two starts in 2017) and does pretty much everything well.
Swafford  ->  positive

Before his 60th-place finish at TPC Sawgrass, Fowler had finishes of 4th, 1st, 16th, 12th, 3rd, and 11th (Zurich team play notwithstanding). To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well. That history may be the one thing that keeps Fowler’s ownership down, which would be an added bonus.
Fowler  ->  positive

Reavie’s success has been coming from his Approach game, where he has been gaining just under a stroke a round once field adjusted. I like Reavie’s affordable price tag and see the ownership low enough to be playable in GPP’s well the floor is high enough he makes a great cash game play. Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

Pre-event pick, Scott Piercy, sits tied for 30th and five off the lead and he looks to have too much on his plate but James Hahn is close enough if good enough on -8 and I'm happy I followed Paul Krishnamurty in with his three Find Me a 100 Winner selections. Michael Thompson is alongside Piercy after a disappointing second round but Chesson Hadley and Grayson Murray are both alongside Hahn in a tie for 11th and I'm just going to cheer those on for now. 09:35 - March 30, 2017  A weather delay yesterday morning has meant round one of the Houston Open is yet to be completed and that's always frustrating when trying to assess the state of play.
James Hahn  ->  positive

I think his top-five finish in a major gave him a huge confidence boost and helped him realize he belongs atop the leaderboard. Props  Rickie Fowler & Justin Thomas (+400) vs. the Field (-650): I’ll take these odds all day. I’ve got Rickie pegged as the winner alone; add in Justin Thomas, and it’s a pretty safe play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

A second-round 64 on debut suggests he has the capability to go low around this course, especially if in form. Finau got into contention once again recently, at the Valero Texas Open, three starts after finishing 5th at the Valspar Championship. Given his current form and the fact he ranks 4th in Greens in Regulation and T4 in Par 4 Performance so far this season, there is every reason to be optimistic about his chances this week.
Finau  ->  positive

MATT’S CINDERELLAS  Dylan Frittelli ($6,900), 41 seed, Group 7  His familiarity with the course/area and potential road to the quarterfinals make him interesting to me. Group 10 doesn’t scare me at all which means you could get at least 5 rounds out of him before his inevitable loss to Justin Thomas. Group 7 is ripe for the picking, and I think whoever makes it out moves on at least one more round.
Justin Thomas.  ->  positive

For you course history guys he has made the cut in four straight years with finishes of T49, T45, T28, T27 which he could easily top this year as he comes in with, by far, the best form of his career. Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (81st)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($7,700)  FantasyAces ($4,900)  I can already tell I will be running 50+ lineups this week as I keep adding more and more players to the article. I can't help it.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Peterson is a brilliant ball-striker who has rededicated himself and with some results this season, while Loupe is long, aggressive and volatile. It could make for a disaster, but if Loupe is on a going week he can make birdies with the best of them and I can see him being given the opportunity to shine in fourballs in particular, with Peterson likely to stay out of trouble even after a couple of disappointing weeks. Both have the expected ties to this event – Peterson was T8 on an invite in 2013, while Loupe made his PGA Tour debut here (note: Kevin Chappell’s pro PGA Tour debut came in the Texas Open, which he won last week).
Loupe  ->  positive

It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey. RESULT: T62  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  We were on board Ollie Schniederjans as recently as Old White TPC and despite a very strange WD there for a scoring card signing infringement, I'm still very much of the opinion that Ollie is a player to watch right now. His last performance at the John Deere Classic was far better as he co-led after shooting a flawless -8/63 on Thursday and backed that up with a -5/66 to get back in contention.

He will be a staple in all of my cash lineups and will also be using him in GPP formats. Who the Stats Like  Ollie Schniederjans  World Golf Ranking (#79)  Vegas Odds (45/1)  Draftkings ($7,600)  FanDuel ($9,400)    Ollie currently sits 10th overall in my stats model this week thanks to his rank of 11th in SG: APP(31st or better in Proximity from 125-200+ yards), 20th in Par 5 SCoring, 21st in Par 4 Scoring, and 7th in Birdie or Better %. Stats are definitely not the only place he stands out this week as he comes in with the 12th best odds in the field(45-1) while his DraftKings price ranks 27th overall.
Ollie Schniederjans  ->  positive

My final selection is 23 year old world number 211 Michael Kim. A former amateur standout, Kim was voted the best collegiate golfer in America in 2013, generally a decent guide to future success as a pro if previous winners Justin Thomas, Russell Henley, Bill Haas, Ryan Moore and Kevin Chappell are anything to go by. Kim is a PGA Tour sophomore so his body of work is largely incomplete but on debut here last year, he fired a third round 66 on route to a 47th place finish, demonstrating an affinity for the course.
Kim.  ->  positive

Brian Harman ($10900) – Guaranteed to have some chalk behind his name, this past champion has had some great form this year which showed itself to a worldwide audience at Erin Hills with a T2 finish to go along with his earlier win at the Wells Fargo. Those two factors along with the overall weakness of the field means Harman will probably be the chalkiest player this week, but he also has some of the highest win upside both statistically and based on his past performance in Illinois: three top-25s (including that win in 2014) to go with two missed cuts in five total tries. Harman is having his best year on tour yet, smashing his previous career earnings and currently sitting in 11th in the Fed Ex Cup standings, and that shows in his overall play this year:  94 Birdies per Round (22 nd )  ) 8 th in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 th in One-Putt %  in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 in One-Putt % 99 Par-4 Scoring Average (15 th )  ) 45% Birdie or Better % (24th)  He does struggle a bit on approach, but a lot of that comes from hitting out of the rough where he struggles immensely.
Harman  ->  positive

All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year. Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches.
Hoffmann  ->  positive

The chart below shows some of the things golfers will need to do to either score (BoB%) or avoid bogeys (BoW%) – the Variance column highlights some of the differences between the two.

Poulter  ->  positive

Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice. DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th.
DJ:  ->  positive

Statswise Snedeker ranks 19th in SG around the green, 35th in SGP, 20th in scrambling and first in par 4 scoring. Emiliano Grillo 50/1  The young Argentinian has been very impressive this season on The PGA Tour. He recorded his first PGA Tour win at The Frys.com Open last October and hasn’t really put a foot wrong since.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

Also Consider: Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, J.B. Holmes  Dark Horse:  Lucas Glover ($8,600) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %.

He should be limited to GPP only on FanDuel where he is in the mid $10K range. Top Current Form Targets  Cameron Smith  World Golf Ranking (#58)  Vegas Odds (66/1)  Draftkings ($7,400)  FanDuel ($9,200)    Consistency plus DraftKings value is brought me back to Cameron Smith this week. After picking up just six Top 25's all of his rookie season, he has already posted five in his first five events to start the 2017-18 season including two Top 10 finishes and ranks 7th in the field in DraftKings scoring over his last 24 rounds.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

(Not that he'd show up, but still quite the question.) For now, we are left with a still-pretty-dang-intriguing tournament at Kapalua, with seven of the top eight in the OWGR on hand, including the top-five: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Hideki Matsuyama. Not too shabby.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

A T9 last year, on just his second start at this course gives a lot of hope, and hopefully he can emulate that success this week. Since his T5 in Houston, Berger has finished T27 at the Masters and T36 at the Wells Fargo last week, where he seemingly failed to get out of cruise control. One of the stats which always comes up here, even if it doesn’t rank as my most important is Scrambling and Berger ranks 12th in that area this season.
Berger  ->  positive

Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun. As Kisner took Jim Furyk all the way having never before had a serious chance to win at this level, what his coach said suddenly made sense.
Kisner,  ->  positive

High-Priced  Jordan Spieth ($11,400) – Obviously Spieth, McIlroy and Day – the three top options on the board – have the upside of carrying you to a fantasy title, but each has enough variance in their game to make them more of a tournament play right now. All three should probably find their way into a lineup or two, but of them, Spieth is my favorite right now. He showed the most last weekend with his Sunday 69 to edge his way up the leaderboard somewhat.
Spieth  ->  positive

Even last week’s Honda Classic effort, where he missed the cut, offered some encouragement. Willett fought back from a nightmare start to shoot an opening 69 and was three-under with seven to play in round two, only for a couple of bogeys followed by a double at the difficult 17th to see him miss out by one. The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course.
Willett  ->  positive

He clearly loves Magnolia Lane. Vegas Odds  Since 2014, Spieth has played in about as many tournaments with odds to win of at least 10 percent as he has with odds of less than 10 percent. Unsurprisingly, he has excelled as a double-digit Vegas favorite:  Conversely, Spieth has exceeded his salary-based expectations in just 20 of 39 tournaments when playing with odds to win of less than 10 percent.
Spieth  ->  positive

Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups.
Day's  ->  positive

But he has improved with his irons approaching the green this season, ranking 59th in GIR percentage at 70%, compared to his 66.2% average GIR over his last two seasons. I hate rostering a player with bad course history, but in this case I really do think Hadwin’s current form outweighs any worries I have about him here at Copperhead. At $6,800, we are getting one of the most consentient players on The Tour this season at a serious discount in a very weak field.
Hadwin’s  ->  positive

There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance. Even if you doubt his ability to win, there's an awful lot of each-way juice in that price with eight each-way places.
Matt Kuchar.  ->  positive

Scott will likely be my one-and-done pick this week as he has gone T-2, T-10 and T-17 in last three tries at Riviera. If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk.
Scott,  ->  positive

At his value price on both sites, he is another golfer I will be targeting in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#5)  Vegas Odds (10/1)  Draftkings ($11,400)  FanDuel ($12,600)    After finishing with a Top 10 at last years Tour Championship, Justin Rose sat at #13 in the world coming into this season. Since then he has picked up three wins on three different tours(HSBC Champions, Turkish Airlines Open, Indonesian Masters) and six other Top 10 finishes including back to back Top 5's coming into this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season. Of his eight PGA events, Grillo has two top-10s, including at a very tough Honda Classic in which he finished T8. Grillo performs well on tough courses, can play in the wind and is a very strong second-shot golfer.
Grillo  ->  positive

He played well at the Safeway Open finishing a respectable T13 and followed that with a T23 at the OHL Classic. Johnson then travelled to Sea Island for the RSM Classic where he shot 64,67 over the weekend to finish T8 on 13 under par for the tournament so his current form looks decent. Zach has a great record here and really seems to have the game to fit this course.
Johnson  ->  positive

More recently Day contended at the US PGA Championship and had it have not been for a third round 77, he may well have won his second major title, and the US PGA Championship for the second time in three years. Day shot an 8 on the par-4 18th in round three and that derailed his chances of winning massively. Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama.
Day  ->  positive

No doubt that still leaves him an appetite for revenge here. Harris English is your Driver-off-the-Deck BOLD play of the week! #isitThursdayyet  Joel Harrington  @joel4deepgolf

Jeff Bergerson: Ben Crane ($6,500) on DraftKings  In weaker fields like this week's Puerto Rico Open, I love looking at our Sportsbook Odds vs. Daily Pricing Tool on our site to help me find the best value plays. One of those great values that is revealed is Ben Crane at $6,800. He has made the cut in his past four tournaments with much stonger fields.
Ben Crane  ->  positive

The good news is that he's posted T13 (2017) and T17 (2016) in the last two years so should approach this week with confidence after his trio of early exits from 2013-2015. Harman returns to Arnie's event as the World No. 22 having been ranked outside the top 100 when he teed it up at Bay Hill 12 months ago.
Harman  ->  positive

Kim  ->  positive

4. Jordan Spieth -- Something is just a little off about Spieth's game right now, but it's still good enough to finish in the top 15 most weeks. 5.
Spieth  ->  positive

It’s hard to predict his ownership with him being an Augusta rookie, but right now Fantasy Labs currently has him projected for a decently low ownership level of 9-12%. I hope this ends up being true, because at only $6,900, Hadwin will be one of my most heavily owned players of the week. Bill Haas: (7,200) Haas’s low projected ownership of 5-8% (via Fantasy Labs), is insane when factoring in his recent form and course history.
Hadwin  ->  positive

He's won once from 66 PGA Tour starts and he makes no appeal at around [14.0]. Regular readers will know that I'm not a huge Adam Scott fan (betting wise) and that I very rarely back him but he's the stand out for me at the head of the market here. In his sole appearance here to date, 10 years ago, he led by three with a round to go but finished seventh so we know the course suits his eye but so it should.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

There is quite a lot of water on the back 9 from holes 15-17, which play around a four acre lake and should offer quite a lot of excitement in the final round on Sunday. Justin Thomas 14/1  What a third round Justin had last week in Erin Hills. He carded an impressive nine birdies and an eagle to post a nine under 63.
Justin  ->  positive

For starters, Haas is in great form. His third-placed finish in the Match Play was a fine effort and came on the back of several others; it's no surprise that he's up with Fowler in the bogey avoidance (second) and scrambling (first) stats which should mean he can tackle Augusta's biggest challenge with confidence. It's something he's done before and in old money, Haas, aged 34 and making his eighth start in the Masters, would look an ideal type in a major where experience has always been considered a positive.
Fowler  ->  positive

Graeme McDowell.  ->  positive

He’s also playing pretty well with two top 5’s in his last 4 starts. Francesco Molinairi ($8,600) Molinari is one of the most consistent and reliable golfers out there. He did have a MC a couple weeks back but overall is 4/5 with all 4 inside the top 20.
Francesco  ->  positive

With great form and a good history here, look for Harman to continue his great year. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Kevin Streelman, $6800 – Though Streelman’s record at TPC Deere Run is hit or miss with three missed cuts and two top-10s, his recent form of five straight top-30s makes him an attractive value option. Daniel Summerhays, $6800 – Summerhays had victory in his sights at TPC Deere Run in 2013 before a bogey on the 72nd hole kept him out of a playoff.
Kevin Streelman,  ->  positive

Ryan Blaum - $6,900 (Field, 8-5)    The 33-year-old rookie is well inside the top-125, and is even nearing the top-100, which would get him into a second playoff event. Blaum has made five straight cuts, two of them top-10s, and has missed only six cuts all season. He's 25th in strokes gained putting.
Blaum  ->  positive

Currently, Reed is looking like a cash game lock and a solid core player in my GPP grouping. Kevin Streelman – FanDuel Value – DK: $7300 FD: $8700  Streelman has been solid lately relying on gaining strokes off of the tee and approaching the green. Although he has been losing strokes putting that can easily turn around week to week and I like the way he has been playing recently.
Streelman  ->  positive

Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
Streb  ->  positive

Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson. In three years, he has two top 10s here at Sheshan Golf Club, including a win in 2014.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

He's a two-time winner of the aforementioned Phoenix Open and I was more than happy to take [50.0]. I thought [60.0] was fair enough for Russell Henley given his remarkable form figures. In just four starts here, over the last four years, he's finished 45th, seventh, fourth and fifth and his form so far in 2017 has been respectable enough.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Scott has always been a player who, once confident, can perform at a high level for a prolonged period of time. Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best.
Scott  ->  positive

He also gained more than a stroke around-the-green in nine starts last year. With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua.
Bryan  ->  positive

We have a wide open event in Texas for this week's PGA Tour offering, and here our man Steve Rawlings arms us with everything we need to know ahead of the Valero Texas Open...  "Moore's form slumped a little after his playoff defeat to Rory McIlroy at the Tour Championship but if his first career top-10 at Augusta last time out is anything to go by, the 34-year-old world number 28 looks ready to go in again." Tournament History  Having first been staged in 1922, the Valero Texas Open is one of the older events on the PGA Tour. The tournament was staged at La Cantera Golf Club between 1995 and 2009 before switching to its current venue - TPC San Antonio - in 2010.
"Moore's  ->  positive

He’s twice placed at Riviera, including on his latest start two weeks ago, and has also gone close at Kuala Lumpur, home of the CIMB Classic, plus Copperhead and Sawgrass. These events have all allowed Na to flourish with a game based around accuracy, and having looked in really good shape last time I can see him carrying that momentum to his best WGC finish, having done really well to share ninth at Doral a couple of years ago. Na is 25/1 for a top-five finish and 10s for a top-10, both of which look good business and the right way to go given that he has just one win to his name from over 300 starts.
Na  ->  positive

The Five-time major winner then traveled to Mexico and defeated Justin Thomas in a play-off after an exciting final round 66 at the WGC-Mexico Championship to claim his first victory since the 2013 Open. Mickelson has a great record here in Houston with form figures 55,13,17,12,16,4 including a win in 2011 in his last seven appearances. Statswise he is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee and ranks 19th in SGTTG, second in SGP and seventh in par 4 scoring.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Selections    I've already got Rickie Fowler onside, after I backed him at Christmas when I wrote this piece here but whether I'd be going in now at around 22/1 after a disappointing missed cut in Memphis last week is debatable. Fowler ranks number one for Total Driving and he's a terrific links player and wind exponent. He's also a fabulous scrambler and he's the one currently wearing the best player to win a major badge.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

It was nice to see Tommy getting the respect his status in world golf now deserves from the PGA Tour as he was paired up in one of the ‘featured groups’ at Riviera with Phil Mickelson, and as you would expect he had no issues in producing a good performance in the environment that comes with playing in a group with Phil in California and with Tiger in the group just ahead. Tommy’s GIR stats have been off the radar over the past 12 months plus and assuming it is ‘normal service’ from him this week I would expect the test offered by PGA National, particularly this week, to play right to his strengths and I am happy to jump on board the ‘Fleetwood Express’. GRAEME MCDOWELL – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  GMac this week is one of those selections that is so blatantly obvious that if you don’t back him and he performs, you’ll be left scratching your head as why on earth you weren’t on.
Tommy  ->  positive

TPC Potomac features six par 4s of 450-500 yards, which Fowler has performed well on this year (8th in Birdie or Better in that range). It’s extremely difficult to fade Fowler given his play this season. Justin Thomas ($10,900) is the third most expensive golfer and comes in off of a missed cut at the Travelers Championship.
Fowler  ->  positive

After running the world's top 40 players through all those qualification criteria, only five players survive. They are: Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia, Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell. Another stat:  Nine of the last 10 US Open winners were not the Masters champion  Sorry Sergio.
Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

His current form reminds me of Jordan Spieth in 2015 (who made the play-off) and I can see the Rahm charge continuing all the way to Magnolia Lane. RESULT: T10  Charley Hoffman 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  The first name that jumped off the entry list for me was Charley Hoffman who I think will go well again in his beloved Texas. With a Masters Invite safely in his back pocket, the World Number 52 will be looking forward to Augusta next week, but with his current form and his obvious liking for the GC of Houston he must be a contender for what would be his 5th career PGA Tour victory this week.

If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Jim Herman; 3) Brian Stuard; 4) James Hahn / Russell Knox / Brendan Steele; 7) William McGirt; 8) Hideki Matsuyama / Bubba Watson; 10) Billy Hurley III; 11) Si Woo Kim; 12) Jhonattan Vegas. Greens in Regulation : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Russell Knox; 3) Brendan Steele; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Branden Grace / Bubba Watson; 8) Justin Thomas / Jhonattan Vegas; 10) Daniel Berger; 11) William McGirt; 12) Ryan Moore. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Pat Perez; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Ryan Moore; 5) Russell Knox; 6) Patrick Reed; 7) Dustin Johnson; 8) Daniel Berger; 9) Brandt Snedeker; 10) Cody Gribble; 11) Si Woo Kim; 16) Branden Grace.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

4. Jimmy Walker -- The PGA champion has a strong TPC Summerlin record, with three top-15 finishes in the last five years. There's a reason MGM sponsors the guy; he shows up in Vegas.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

He sits in the top quarter on Tour in all the key stats for the week (strokes gained: approach, Par 5 scoring, birdie or better %), and is now using these events to get ready for The Masters. Austin Cook ($8,700) – The early frontrunner for rookie of the year, Austin Cook has more than that on his mind. Cook has come out on fire to start his PGA Tour career.
Austin Cook  ->  positive

The HSBC Champions is a tricky event to weight up because several of the classier players are making their first starts of the season and will they be fully wound up after a break? Justin Rose has plenty of incentive to win in China, he’s won at least once every year since 2010 but is winless in 2017 and would hate to end that streak. During the Playoffs he found some form with finishes of 10-10-2-10 in some strong (although limited) fields.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

So far, in the 36 rounds he has played this season, Reavie ranks 5th in SG: Tee-To-Green, 8th in SG: Approach-The-Green and 5th in SG: Total. Specifically important to this week, Reavie ranks 6th in Scrambling, 22nd in Greens in Regulation and 23rd in Ball Striking (10th in Driving Accuracy). There are six Par-4’s between 450-500 yards here at Riviera, and with Reavie averaging 290 yards off the tee this season, his approaches from 150-175 and 175-200 yards this week will be important.
Reavie  ->  positive

Miracles happen. Back Lucas Glover 1u ew @ 200/1    Speaking of miracles in majors, I've always felt Lucas Glover was one of the luckiest major champions. At Bethpage Black in 2009, he benefited from a very lop-sided draw, very un-like US Open conditions after torrential rain, and then did everything he could to throw it away.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
Dustin Johnson.  ->  positive

Three months later he went to another California venue with small greens and took T10 in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. From Memorial in June to the BMW in September, Hughes missed just one cut in 10 starts so he really has established himself at this level. On the stats last season, the 26-year-old finished 8th for Strokes Gained: Putting and only seven players racked up more than his 374 birdies.
Hughes  ->  positive

RESULT: T2nd  Alexander Levy 0.5pt EW 125/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Jordan L Smith 0.5pt EW 200/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get a £10 free bet. 18+, T&Cs apply:  With 2 decent punts on a couple of the short-priced players, I'll finish with a couple of longshots.
Smith  ->  positive

But he'll have hit the reset button since placing 10th in Tiger's tournament and he's definitely worth following in this event. Hopefully, this is the best market for us to fully cash in and it's worth pointing out that with four payout places, Reed could finish eighth in the tournament and we'd still edge a profit on him. With the front of the betting so strong, it's hard to find much space for any bigger-priced players.
Reed  ->  positive

He finished 39th and scored just 68 DK points so the opportunity to capitalize on recency bias exists. Rose’s 68.4 LT Adj Rd Score is fifth, his 70.5 LT GIR percentage is seventh, and his 302.6-yard LT DD is 21st overall. Rose has made the cut at Riviera in five straight trips, including a 16th-place finish last year.
Rose’s  ->  positive

So, instead of targeting year-long stats, I’m focusing on rolling stats from the past five weeks. Looking at this data, the field leaders in SG:APP are Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey, Daniel Berger, Mark Hubbard, Marc Leishman, Byeong-Hun An, David Lingmerth, and Scott Piercy. Strokes Gained Putting (SG:P): I don’t typically target putting stats, but I think putting will be huge this week because everyone in the field should be hitting fairways and greens.
Justin Thomas,  ->  positive

Look for him to add to the resume this week where he is comfortable on Bent grass. Kyle Stanley ($9,600) – It feels weird going back to Stanley after a victory but then I ask myself who else are you going to take in this field? Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass.
Stanley  ->  positive

I've laid out my argument for Ross Fisher in this week's each-way column here and I'm following Paul Krishnamurty in with Alex Levy at a triple-figure price. Selections:  Martin Kaymer [44.0]  Ross Fisher @ [80.0]  Alex levy @ [100.0]    I'll be back later with my Sanderson Farms Championship preview later today. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter  https://twitter.com/SteveThePunter
Ross Fisher  ->  positive

Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus. They are:  Chesson Hadley (5th in SG: Approach)  Ollie Schniederjans (12th in SG: Approach)  Chris Kirk (19th in SG: Approach)  Course experience is helpful here, although Woodland did win in debut in 2011, but course form is general is not a sticking point. Another thing to bear in mind this week is the sheer amount of Par 3’s (five) as well as four Par 5’s.
Ollie Schniederjans  ->  positive

It was nice to see Tommy getting the respect his status in world golf now deserves from the PGA Tour as he was paired up in one of the ‘featured groups’ at Riviera with Phil Mickelson, and as you would expect he had no issues in producing a good performance in the environment that comes with playing in a group with Phil in California and with Tiger in the group just ahead. Tommy’s GIR stats have been off the radar over the past 12 months plus and assuming it is ‘normal service’ from him this week I would expect the test offered by PGA National, particularly this week, to play right to his strengths and I am happy to jump on board the ‘Fleetwood Express’. GRAEME MCDOWELL – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  GMac this week is one of those selections that is so blatantly obvious that if you don’t back him and he performs, you’ll be left scratching your head as why on earth you weren’t on.
Tommy  ->  positive

A two-time major championship winner, a FedEx Cup Champion, and a former World’s No. 1 golfer, Jordan Spieth is clearly one of golf’s brightest young stars. With a win and two third-place finishes in the first two months of 2017, he’s back to looking a bit like the Spieth of 2015, when he won five tournaments including the Masters and U.S. Open.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He comes back with some excellent course history(for the price) as he has a Top 25 finish in five straight trips and a Top 30 finish in nine straight trips to Innisbrook Resort. Looking at the same rolling report for Strokes Gained: Around the Green, Dufner ranks 19th, 34th, 15th, and 9th over his last 4, 8, 12, and 24 rounds here. Also using Fantasy National Golf Club, we notice that Dufner is an excellent wind player and with this week's forecast, that will be key.
Dufner  ->  positive

Lower Tier  Luke List ($7600) (Finished 29th here last year)  JJ Spaun ($7800)  Anirban Lahiri ($7300)  Sung Kang ($7400)  Nick Watney ($7500)  Martin Laird ($7700)  GPP wild cards with upside  Daniel Summerhays ($7000)  Freddie Jacobson ($6500)  Shawn Stefani ($6100)  Kevin Tway ($6000) I like him for his course history and the fact he ranks 4th in Bogey Avoidance for a course that could potentially see the winner in single digits under par. (Patrick Reed $9700 and Zach Johnson $9300 have worse odds to win it all than Billy does).
Shawn Stefani  ->  positive

Tied for seventh at the Masters. Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

For a player who ranked outside the top 100 in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, it's remarkable that he's now third on the PGA Tour in strokes-gained putting and this confidence with the flat-stick is filtering through his game, with the driver another major weapon. Leishman also figures highly in bogey avoidance (eighth), he's a top-25 par-five performer who figures in the 'sneaky long' category, and he's quite simply on top of the world right now especially as, after a life-threatening illness, wife Audrey is almost back to full health and the couple are expecting their third child. It's easy to see them enjoying a relaxed preparation, including the par-three tournament, and from there Leishman can launch another major challenge in an event he skipped to be by Audrey's side two years ago.
Leishman  ->  positive

In those four starts he has two missed cuts, but when he has made the weekend has looked fairly good. At the Shriners Hopsitals for Children Open, Jones shot four sub-70 rounds, including an opening-round 65 to finish T15. Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back.
Jones  ->  positive

Add it all up and the risk is much too high for the projected ownership but if you are wanting to get some of that local knowledge in your lineup, roster Webb on FanDuel in the mid $7K range. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage.
Haas  ->  positive

Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion.
Rickie Fowler's  ->  positive

Hideki should easily be among the highest-owned players on all DFS golf websites, but he’s more than worth the salary and attention this week. Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

Rickie enters the week as the 11th-ranked golfer in the world and is coming off three solid weeks – Bridgestone is still pending so it’s excluded – with finishes of T22, T3, and T5 before his last missed cut at the St. Jude. Fowler also finished T11 at Augusta, and although he’s yet to win a major his track record with high finishes in majors combined with his track record at Quail Hollow are positive signs. In the last six years at this course, the diminutive candidate for BPTNWAM has won (2012), made the cut with mediocre finishes twice, and finished T4 last year.
Fowler  ->  positive

I would expect more of the same this week in a weak field event where Campbell is reasonably priced. Hao-Tang Li – GPP – DK: $7400 FD: $6900  Li has sprung together quite the season and I will continue to be on him well he remains underpriced and relatively unknown. Across the European, Tour Li has sprung up inside of the top 10 four times in sixteen starts, pretty impressive.
Li  ->  positive

And once more, he's right on the bubble when it comes to qualifying for a team event - this time the Presidents Cup, in which he was disappointing two years ago and will doubtless therefore be keen to make amends. Patrick Reed  You know as well as I do that he'll be selected as a wild card regardless, but that was also the case a year ago yet the Texan wanted to take care of business for himself. There's absolutely no doubt that his sensational performance at Hazeltine, capped by that Sunday singles win over McIlroy, can be traced back to the way he hauled himself over the line at Bethpage.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Look for the same result this time. Spieth will finish eight under. DJ is the best player in the game right now, and he wins at all kinds of courses, but he'll finish seven under.
Spieth  ->  positive

Selections    Tournament standing dishes, Zach Johnson and Steve Stricker were first and second favourites last year. They're getting long in the tooth now and Zach, in-particular, is struggling form wise but I thought they were worth small savers at around [30.0] and I also like the defending champ and this year's Heritage winner, Wesley Bryan. Ryan Moore hasn't played for five weeks because of a strained tendon in his left shoulder so there's a danger he's rushing back to make his defence.
Wesley Bryan.  ->  positive

At only $7,700 this week, I like his value for cash games, but also like his upside for GPPs. -- Jeff Bergerson  Bud Cauley  Cauley's been an excellent value play this season, with two top-10 finishes (RSM Classic and Safeway Open), and only one missed cut in eight events played. He's only played this course three times in his career, missing the cut in both 2012 and 2013, but finishing T27 last year.
Cauley  ->  positive

Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
Glover’s  ->  positive

Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

It has been a strange season for Rose, with injury problems playing their part. After finishing a close 2nd behind Sergio Garcia at the Masters in April, Rose struggled for form in the bigger events, missing the cut at both the U.S. Open and PGA Championship as well as finishing just T54 at the Open Championship and T63 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. A T4 finish at the Irish Open and T12 at Wentworth in that same span gave reason optimism though and once he got himself fully fit and in the right frame of mind, he managed to put together that great run during the FedEx play-offs.
Rose,  ->  positive

Last season, Spieth led the PGA Tour in SG: Approach and ranked 10th in terms of proximity. Hideki Matsuyama - $15,400    Despite his putting struggles, Matsuyama has notched a pair of top-three finishes in two appearances at the Tournament of Champions due to his elite ball-striking. During the 2016-17 season he ranked fifth on Tour in proximity on approaches from 150-175 yards and eighth in proximity from 175-200 yards.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

His birdie average of 3.89 per round is strong, especially considering his price point, and unless he ends up with Dustin Johnson, Rahm or Justin Thomas, he'll be have a great opportunity to upset a bracket. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks (for the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship)  Eric Axley  There are events each year where the field is a little bit weak, and then there are fields that are just barely above what we would see at a Web.com Tour event with not even enough names at the top to have big favorites overall. The key is going to be able to fit a couple of the decent names at the top onto your rosters this week, but you won't be able to do it without diving into the lower-salary tiers to find a couple of overlooked names.
Eric Axley  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

Reed's record defending titles is strong - he's never been worse than 24th in four attempts, and almost won back-to-back renewals of the Tournament of Champions only to finish second - and with form at Firestone and Muirfield Village in the bag, he looks a solid alternative to the better-fancied runners, few of whom are more prolific. While The Northern Trust (formerly The Barclays) has thrown up some strange names in the top five and a totally shock winner in Heath Slocum eight years ago, Reed was the seventh successive high-class winner, every one of them either a Presidents or Ryder Cup player in their own right. Perhaps unsurprisingly, four of these winners had gone really well at the PGA Championship in their previous start, finishing inside the top 10.
Reed  ->  positive

It was his first win in over 5 years and the way he saw off both Tyrrell Hatton in regulation and then 2018 form-horse Justin Thomas in a playoff was very, very impressive. Mickelson ticks every single statistical box I'm looking for this week, he's hitting the ball long and is hitting enough fairways to be competitive. 4th in Strokes Gained Approach tells a story and he's 2nd in Strokes Gained Putting.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter. Winners & Prices : 2017: Matsuyama 11/1 ; 2016: Matsuyama 25/1 ; 2015: Koepka 40/1 ; 2014: Stadler 125/1 ; 2013: Mickelson 25/1 ; 2012: Stanley 66/1 ; 2011: Wilson 80/1 ; 2010: Mahan 66/1 ; Average: 53/1.
Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

This course presents him with arguably the best opportunity for him to get the win that will put the icing on the cake on an already impressive start to 2017. Jimmy Walker ($10,500) – It came to light during the Masters that Walker has been suffering from Mononucleosis since last November, which may explain his inconsistent form. A T18 finish at the Masters two weeks was his third top-20 of the season, but his T9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions (reduced field) still remains his lone top-10.
Walker  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 30-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 36th  No prizes for me for originality I’m afraid as my third pick this week goes to another player who was in our team at the Honda three weeks ago in the form of the inform Alex Noren. For want of copying and pasting my thoughts on Noren back at the Honda I shall simply say the obvious in that the Swede’s start to his first full season on the PGA tour has been hugely impressive. Based on current form there is every argument for his price to be as short, if not shorter than Rickie, Rory, Henrik and a returning Hideki and it is only a lack of course form I’m assuming which has sees him priced up as 30-1 shot.
NOREN  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
Bryson  ->  positive

Jon Rahm 20/1  Big hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm has made quite an impact on the PGA Tour this season with a win and seven top 10’s under his belt so far. After shooting a final round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open in February, Rahm bagged his first PGA Tour win at previous US Open venue, Torrey Pines, finishing on 13 under par in total. He has shown some great consistency this year finishing T5 at Pebble Beach, T3 at the WGC Mexico Championship, solo second at the WGC Matchplay, T10 in Houston, solo fourth at the Wells Fargo and a T2 at the Dean & Deluca in Colonial recently.
Rahm  ->  positive

According to our Trends tool, golfers with a LT DD of at least 305 yards have generated a +7.81 Plus/Minus at Augusta National. Like Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Johnson has a top-three LT Adjusted Birdie Average in the field. Spieth: Masters Report  In fact, Johnson’s 17.2 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is second to only Rory McIlroy, which enhances DJ’s value in the DraftKings scoring system.
Johnson  ->  positive

Our man takes a look at this week's PGA Tour action, where Tiger Woods starts for the first time in 16 months. Read his comprehensive preview here...  "My only other pick is outsider, Brandt Snedeker, who’s playing the course for the first time. Sneds did me a favour last month when he easily won the inaugural Fuji International on an exposed, breezy course that isn’t too dissimilar to this one and he looks a very fair price."
Brandt Snedeker,  ->  positive

21st on debut here in 2013 was followed by 12th a year later and although he's not improved on that since, he arrives here this year in far better overall form and with a whole cabinet full of trophies acquired since then. RESULT: Winner  Kevin Chappell 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Jason Dufner 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (6 places, 1/5 odds):  A field of the highest quality this week may well produce a fairly obvious winner - indeed 3 of the past 4 winners have been single-figure chances before obliging - and with 2 decent bets on a couple of the shorter-priced players that doesn't leave a massive amount of room for manoeuvre.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Jhonattan Vegas  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($8,700)  It is a bit of a home game for Vegas this week as he attended the University of Texas just two hours down the road. Looking over a quote from last year(via Future of Fantasy Golfanac), Vegas is clearly comfortable playing here and it shows with the results recently as he has T15 and T19 in his last two trips to the Houston Open. He made an early exit from the WGC Match Play last week but did have a T20 at the WGC Mexico at the start of March and has made nine of 11 cuts so far this year so there is even some nice form coming in this time around.
Vegas  ->  positive

Reavie finished last season strong with six straight top 25’s and has shown decent course history with three straight made cuts including a top 10 last season. The course fits Reavie’s game as his lack of distance off of the tee won’t hurt him as much as it would on other layouts. According to our Research Station, Reavie is number 1 in field adjusted driving accuracy of any player priced over $9000 on FanDuel.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

MacKenzie now lives in Jupiter, Florida, but the others have stayed put or moved to South Carolina or nearby Georgia (Love). Jason Kokrak is a Charlotte resident and others that now reside in the state include rank outsiders, Brad Fritsch, Chad Collins and Johnson Wagner but the three players in the field that require particular attention are frequent course visitor, Bill Haas, and Eagle Point members Webb Simpson and Carl Pettersson...  Simpson, who was born here, went to college here and who still lives here, tweeted back in March "I learned to play golf at Eagle Point. It'll be pretty special to play a PGA Tour event there in May.
Webb  ->  positive

Those two factors along with the overall weakness of the field means Harman will probably be the chalkiest player this week, but he also has some of the highest win upside both statistically and based on his past performance in Illinois: three top-25s (including that win in 2014) to go with two missed cuts in five total tries. Harman is having his best year on tour yet, smashing his previous career earnings and currently sitting in 11th in the Fed Ex Cup standings, and that shows in his overall play this year:  94 Birdies per Round (22 nd )  ) 8 th in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 th in One-Putt %  in Strokes Gained: Putting / 11 in One-Putt % 99 Par-4 Scoring Average (15 th )  ) 45% Birdie or Better % (24th)  He does struggle a bit on approach, but a lot of that comes from hitting out of the rough where he struggles immensely. He’s not the most accurate off the tee at only 62.52% of fairways hit, but with the width of the fairways and the lack of distance needed, he should be able to club down and pick his spots better than some of the other courses he’s played this year.
Harman  ->  positive

He is going to be popular as he is currently the top tagged golfer on FanShare but with his distance and all-around game, he is a top play in all formats. Stewart Cink  World Golf Ranking (#156)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($6,900)  FanDuel ($7,200)    Dipping down into the sub $7K range, we find Stewart Cink who ranks quite high in my stats model this week. While his SG: OTT ranks outside the Top 50, he averages about 294 yards off the tee and ranks 4th overall on the sheet in SG: APP.

A player who's traditionally gone from Augusta direct to Quail Hollow in terms of schedule, Ryan now finds himself outside of the OWGR top 50 and needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Open. So the tight, Carolina course set-up at Harbour Town clearly appeals to Moore who hasn't visited these South Carolina shores since 2008 (he missed the cut, then finished 2nd at the Byron Nelson a week later). Logically though the test this week at Harbour Town should suit him down the ground.

Charley Hoffman’s  ->  positive

The left-hander has never managed a top 20 in an Open and had missed four of his previous eight cuts so it clearly was an event which troubled him. But Watson battled away to finish T27 and I think he can take the positives from that performance to Glen Abbey this week. He's still not found anywhere near the form which won him two Masters titles in three years but T6 at Memorial (a Jack Nicklaus design, as is Glen Abbey) was a reminder of his talents and he's made all three cuts in July and shot six of his last 12 rounds in the 60s.
Watson  ->  positive

My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest. So much is about momentum at this time of year and while plenty of the field are going the wrong way, the Englishman is coming on strong.
Spieth  ->  positive

The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four.
Chappell's  ->  positive

He started the season with a T7 at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia which included a second round 63 and a final round 65. Casey then tee’d it up at the CJ Cup finishing T19 and followed that with a T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions, T8 in Pebble and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship where he shot three rounds of 68 or better. Casey then went to Copperhead where he shot a final round 69 to post 10 under in total, one clear of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed.
Casey  ->  positive

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo is buying into the hype, saying Tiger Woods will “threaten” in his quest for a 15th major championship this week. Woods is on a mission to add to his 79 PGA TOUR victories and 14 majors, returning to Augusta National for the first time in a playing capacity since a T17 finish in 2015. Woods has already collected the green jacket four times, but not since 2005.
Tiger Woods  ->  positive

His SG: Tee to Green would put him second after only Dustin Johnson if he had enough qualified rounds, and his 0.843 SG: Approach would have him sixth – it is a small tracked sample, but those numbers combined with his results on the European Tour show that this Brit is no fluke. The approach numbers are the most tantalizing aspect of Fleetwood’s game for this course, and although his PGA GIR% of 61.51% doesn’t jump out as anything special, he’s currently ranked 2nd in that category across the pond (82.6%, although the Euro Tour average is higher overall than the PGA’s, at 68.7%). Fleetwood’s scrambling also leaves something to be desired, but a large part of that has come not from the wedge but from poor putting.
Fleetwood’s  ->  positive

Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall. Duf Daddy has two runner-up finishes at Colonial (2012 and 2014) and finished sixth last year.
Jason Dufner:  ->  positive

Based at college in Florida for a while and comfortable here, this very good putter should see his tee-to-green efforts keep many bogeys off his card and I was happy to play around 75/80-1 this week. Another main tour maiden, Bud Cauley, was very high on the list until he withdrew from the Honda with a wrist injury so his inclusion here takes a chance he is fully recovered. However, his claims look as good as any of the three-figure prices on offer and I am happy to judge him on a number of decent comparative efforts.
Bud Cauley,  ->  positive

Having finished 6th at a similar course layout which he’d previously won, just eight starts ago, there’s no reason why he can’t pop up again at a great price. The World Ranking Play:  Charley Hoffman ($6,900) – A weak field and we have the 49th player in the world at $6,900. He also happens to be a former winner of the course so we know he can do well here.

Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Rory McIlroy  Making his first start at TPC River Highlands, McIlroy has plenty of incentive. He certainly didn't enjoy missing the cut at the U.S. Open, but the Twitter spat that evolved later with former PGA Championship winner Steve Elkington is sure to provide extra motivation.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Designed by John Bredemus & Perry Maxwell, Colonial Country Club is a tight Par 70 layout measuring 7,204 yards. It is very much a shot maker's course that rewards tee to green accuracy and course management will be key over the four days in Fort Worth.Tied 13th last week at the AT&T Byron Nelson to register his ninth top 25 finish of the season, Dufner opened with rounds of 69, 68 and 65 at the Four Seasons Resort in Dallas. The American was tied 14th at The Honda Classic in February before posting three top 12 finishes at the Valspar Championship, Shell Houston Open and RBC Heritage.
Dufner  ->  positive

Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
Cameron Smith  ->  negative

This year he has been drawn in a group with his Ryder Cup buddy Jordan Spieth, Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel. As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through.
Reed  ->  positive

He was T24 two weeks at the Wells Fargo and shot a bogey-free 4 under to finish there, one of the best rounds of the day. Schauffele also seems to set up well for this week’s course stylistically too, as he ranks second in efficiency scoring on 450-500-yard par 4s and 30th overall in Par 4 Scoring. If you include the team event, Schauffele has actually finished 30th or better in three of his last four starts on tour and could excel this week on a venue that has been kind to first-timers.

Certainly less of a household name than the previous mentions, the 28-year-old really should have secured his maiden victory last week when leading inside the back-9 before an incorrect swing led to a double-bogey on 16. Impressive for the three early rounds, Hoge comes here with a 7th in last season’s afore-mentioned Shriners and, to confirm last week’s third-round effort in the wind, has enough in his record in Texas and Puerto Rico. There is precedent of players ‘throwing’ away wins coming back to gain revenge soon after and at 100-1, he’s worth the poke.
Hoge  ->  positive

Of course, that's probably on the mind of every golfer in the field but Spieth usually accomplishes his goals. Dating back to last year's DEAN & DELUCA, Spieth has gained 3 or more strokes over the field in 16-of-17 PGA TOUR events. After an early-season struggle with the flat stick, he picked up 3.6 strokes putting at the Genesis Open.

Justin Thomas  ->  positive

What was encouraging at Torrey Pines is in addition to his normal tee to green strengths Harris actually topped the scrambling stats for the week and if he can keep these numbers going whilst getting one or two more putts to drop another big finish is on the cards. Finally further encouragement is given in English’s recent record at TPC Scottsdale which includes two top 10s in the past 4yrs. SCOTT PIERCY – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  Unsurprisingly for a man who spent his college days at UNLV Piercy is something of a desert golf specialist and any time he comes in to a desert event in any kind of form he is one for the short list.
Harris  ->  positive

Seamus Power  3. Sam Saunders  MY PICK : Ollie Schniederjans ($8,500)  Ollie got off to a great start in Hawaii (T7 at Sony Open) but ultimately made one too many mistakes to be a factor for the win there. He’s made it a point, however, to make getting his first win a priority this year, and this venue seems like it should suit him just fine for those purposes.

His profile as a long hitter shadows the fact that he's actually the total package. Billy Horschel has a glowing track record in this tournament, but all of us might swerve if not for his T5 at the RBC Heritage. Conservative front-runners will still abstain because of his inconsistency, but the rest of us will latch onto his immediate success after returning to a putter of familiar length.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

I didn't want to go in to the event without a leftfield pick, so I've thrown a few pounds at Kyle Stanley at a huge price. Stanley missed the cut here on debut back in 2012 so that's a negative, as he hasn't been back since, but he was a winner on Tour last year, at the Quicken Loans National, and he's in fair form at present, having finished 25th in Mexico, 14th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and having reached the last eight at the WGC-Match Play two weeks ago. He's an extremely accurate player and a notoriously poor putter but his putting improves considerably on really fast greens.
Stanley  ->  positive

Nick Watney ... Not that there was ever a doubt, but he’s playing with a new lease on status, so to speak. For finishing among the throng at T5 (with partner Charley Hoffman) at TPC Louisiana, Watney met the terms of his Major Medical Extension by $3,091. He still had 10 starts to burn and wasn’t in danger of reduced playing time, but it was a nice way to celebrate his 36th birthday (April 25).
Watney  ->  positive

For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Xander Schauffele;  ->  positive

He is also no stranger to Riviera Country Club, and like Leishman, had a solid finish in 2016, with a solo seventh, in which he had three rounds in the 60s. Reavie is not the biggest guy, and won’t be able to keep up off the tee with the aforementioned golfers, but his confidence is through the roof right now, which is more than enough reason for him to be deployed in a good amount of lineups. Sleeper for Cheaper  Jimmy Walker ($7,200)  It isn’t often that a player two years removed from winning a Major Championship can be considered a sleeper, but with his price down near the minimum ($6,600) Walker could be a sneaky play this week.
Reavie  ->  positive

He’s coming off another decent Masters, where he finished T28 and should be a popular pick this week. Russell Knox has really taken to Harbour Town. In his first four appearances here — over the past four seasons — Knox has finished T11-T2-T18-T9.
Knox  ->  positive

Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox! He has form a plenty on Pete Dye courses and I’m not at all surprised to see him now adding this event back on to his schedule after missing it the last two years.
Kirk,  ->  positive

He's a strong cut-maker in most fields, and on this course (course history seems to matter here), he presents the upside we're looking for in tournaments. -- Taras Pitra  Charles Howell III  There are a lot of great options this week in the $7K range, but Howell is one of the most consistently solid performers. He has made the cut at Bay Hill in each of his past nine appearances while recording four top-25 finishes.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

He’s an easy play at this price. VALUE  Charley Hoffman ($7,900) – Sir Charles returns after his somewhat disappointing finish at Quail, and seeing as the course has tee boxes, fairways, and greens, there’s simply no way I won’t own at least some Charley Hoffman. He’s playing far too strong of golf for me not to want to a good bit of him, and I would expect that a return to his contending form is imminent.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Brandt Snedeker ($6,800): Announced Wednesday he had to withdraw due to rib issue. Fade: Phil Mickelson. I’m not confident in Rory, but he could turn things around completely at any moment.
Phil Mickelson.  ->  negative

If he can keep it up – and he’s shown no signs of stopping – he’s easily one of the best values on the board this week. BARGAIN BIN  Bill Haas ($6,900) – In this range, you have to take what you can get, and I’ll gladly take the experience and track record of Bill Haas. Forget the British – it’s completely irrelevant here, and Haas has been pretty outstanding otherwise, including some rather strong finishes at this event over the past five years.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

The hardest part this week will be gauging the motivation for these top studs. If he’s motivated, Spieth is my pick to win. Looking at my recent strokes gained model, Spieth ranks seventh.
Spieth  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.

David was right in contention at the Travelers last week before falling back in the final round, but a return to a course where he made his web.com breakthrough in 2012 should see him right in the mix again this week. Result: T5  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here:  We all know that Billy Horschel likes a technical challenge and with a win at TPC Four Seasons last month allied to 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and another 4th at TPC Southwind on his last non-Major appearance, the Floridian has a real chance of being able to represent the United States for the first time as a professional in the Presidents Cup. A win this week would get Billy into the automatic qualification spots and on a course like TPC Potomac where hitting greens will be at a premium in the breezy conditions, I really like his chances.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

The Masters link might be worth exploring, though. Marsh Benson, formerly the senior course director at Augusta before retiring, was brought in as a consultant on this project and that, combined with those Augusta mentions, is enough to support Bill Haas at 40/1. Haas might be another who relishes the move away from Quail Hollow, even if he perhaps wouldn't admit it, because his record there had grown stale.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

But with such a small, no-cut field, it's certainly possible for a first-timer to secure a high finish. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Justin Thomas - $11,100 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 6-1)    If there's one course all season that rewards aggressiveness, it's Kapalua. As we learned last season, Thomas thrives on courses that aren't too penal off the tee.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

However, the other side of the argument is that by virtually every other measure he's playing close to his best at present and, unlike some, he'll be motivated to win regardless of the looming major championship. Part of the reason Mickelson loves this event is that Golf Club of Houston is set up to mimic Augusta, which means limited rough, dramatic, closely-mown run-off areas and slick, pure greens, and his comfort level across both courses is such that he's a strong fancy to go really close. At first in strokes-gained around the green and fifth in strokes-gained putting, Mickelson's short-game is razor-sharp right now and that means there's no need to experiment.
Mickelson  ->  positive

A T18 finish at the Masters two weeks was his third top-20 of the season, but his T9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions (reduced field) still remains his lone top-10. Walker was showing life ahead of the Masters, with three straight top-25’s, at the Genesis Open, Honda Classic and WGC – Mexico Championship, before lacklustre efforts at both the Match Play and the Shell Houston Open. Like his play this season, Walker’s record at TPC San Antonio is inconsistent, but is not without its highlights.
Walker  ->  positive

Kirk has been putting well enough - 47th Strokes Gained Putting - this season and sits inside our Putting Average 10-week tracker top 13, so it was interesting to see that his TPC Sawgrass performance a fortnight ago was driven by a great all-round showing. 6th for Ball Striking, 5th for Greens in Regulation and 5th for Putting Average generated Kirk's best ever finish at TPC Sawgrass and he also shot a -3/69 in the windiest conditions on Saturday. As we know with Chris, he often pops up with a win from very little (he has 4 PGA Tour wins) and Colonial has thrown up plenty of double winners over recent times including Kenny Perry (2003 & 2005) and Zach Johnson (2010 & 2012).
Kirk's  ->  positive

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.

After going through the aforementioned process, I've changed my mind. Given my position (of power) in pursuit, I'm going with the modern-age horse for the course – Spieth. Rose could fill in the blank that Garcia doesn't later.
Spieth.  ->  positive

On top of the stats, Horschel has some excellent course history including two straight Top 5 finishes and three in his last four trips to the Oaks Course. With Hadwin and Donald likely commanding a ton of ownership, Horschel makes a projected low owned GPP play. If you have any questions leading up to lineup lock Thursday morning you can reach me in a variety of ways.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Obligatory bet on Russell Knox (obviously) and threw a few darts with Blayne Barber, Michael Thompson, and Fabian Gomez at long odds.
Blayne Barber,  ->  positive

He’s won the Reno-Tahoe open which also tends to favor West Coast specialists (Pat Perez was the runner-up, and I’ll get to him later), so there is a definitely connection. At this event, Piercy has three top-10s in the past five years. With John Rahm-chalk just above him and bigger names like Jimmy Walker and Kevin Na right below him in pricing, Piercy could go extremely overlooked this week.
Piercy  ->  positive

He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler. I think all of these names are viable picks this week.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Given this event immediately follows the US Masters again, as it has for the last four years and as it did between 1983 and 2010, I've taken a look at how the winners here this century had fared at Augusta. 2016 - Branden Grace - MC at Augusta  2015 - Jim Furyk - MC at Augusta  2014 - Matt Kuchar - 5th at Augusta  2013 - Graeme McDowell - MC at Augusta  2010 - Jim Furyk - MC at Augusta  2009 - Brian Gay - Didn't play at the Masters  2008 - Boo Weekley - 20th at Augusta  2007 - Boo Weekley - Didn't play at the Masters  2006 - Aaron Baddeley - Didn't play at the Masters  2005 - Peter Lonard - MC at Augusta  2004 - Stewart Cink - 17th at Augusta  2003 - Davis Love - 15th at Augusta  2002 - Justin Leonard - 20th at Augusta  2001 - Jose Coceres - MC at Augusta  2000 - Stewart Cink - 28th at Augusta  It's a mixed bag and it doesn't reveal an awful lot but given eight of the last ten winners have either not played there or missed the cut at Augusta, a high finish in last week's major is far from imperative. Is There an Identikit Winner?
Aaron Baddeley  ->  positive

I don't think we need to go stars and scrubs this week in cash games but Rickie makes a very high upside GPP play and is the only player on my sheet to rank Top 10 in all four categories. Billy Horschel  World Golf Ranking (#81)  Vegas Odds (110/1)  Draftkings ($7,100)  FanDuel ($8,400)  If you are looking to take a risk and go a bit contrarian this week consider Billy Horschel. He comes back to PGA National with back to back Top 10 finishes in 2017 and 2016 but could be lower owned as the form has been pretty bad lately as he is coming off back to back missed cuts.
Vegas  ->  positive

With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week. Ian Poulter – Cash – DK: $8700 FD: $7400  Poulter continued his streak of good play at the Open Championship with a T14 finish. Poulter is among the elite in Shots Gained: Approach and Shots Gained: Scrambling this season which makes him a safe play and perfect for cash.
Poulter  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen ($7,200): Maybe the strangest price of anyone, Oosthuizen put together his third straight solid start last week and also had four rounds of par or better at the Honda—and also lead the field in Greens in Regulation percentage. Oosthuizen has been uber-solid off the tee in his last two starts ranking 8th and 11th for Driving accuracy respectively. One final link for Oosthy this week is the fact this course uses Kikuyu rough, grass often found in his home country of South Africa.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

4. Jimmy Walker - Jimmy Walker has been somewhat quietly playing good golf since winning the PGA Championship. He shocked with a MC at the Sony Open; don't expect that here.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

We have seen before that some players become more prolific winners in their twilight years, so at 40/1 I am willing to chance that he will ride this good form for a bit longer and at least contend. Perez has four top-10’s and a further two top-20’s here since 2005, so he has enjoyed relative success on this course. I have high hopes that he can match or better his 4th place finish here in 2008 and therefore do think he is worth having on side at 40/1.
Perez  ->  positive

I am willing to overlook his previous course form here, as I believe like others before him, he can put the past in his rear-view mirror on this course and get himself into contention for win number one. Chesson Hadley 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds) & 100/1 (Skybet 8 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Chesson Hadley is the one player who really jumps out at me this week and I was pleased to see he was three-figures. He had a very strong start to the season and has petered up and down in form since, with a missed cut last time out ensuring longer odds on him this week.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

With all this in mind, here are my selections for the 2017 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time.
Mickelson  ->  positive

For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico. This week, he will be the one standing with the trophy on Sunday evening.
Rory McIlroy.  ->  positive

While he had a bad missed cut at the Valero, he performed great at the RBC Heritage (on another Pete Dye course) where he ranked eighth in Strokes Gained: Approaches for the week, and also had a nice week at the team event on another Dye design, at the Zurich Classic. While I’m not expecting Poulter to win this week, a top 10 is very possible given his recent form and history at this venue and that sort of upside makes him an exceptional GPP target. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Poulter  ->  positive

However as I’ve said a few times in this preview already the slightest of adjustments could change this dramatically and if this were to happen and Zach got right in the hunt there is no doubting his ability to get the job done. UPDATED 3rd APRIL  MASTERS TRADER - JIMMY WALKER Finished 20th  As has been well document Walker has been struggling over the past twelve months plus after being diagnosed with the debilitating illness Lyme Disease. [coincidentally he was diagnosed on the eve of the 2017 Masters].
JIMMY WALKER  ->  positive

He’s shown great success at TPC Boston and he’s going to be an elite option in all formats this weekend. Sergio Garcia ($9500)  So, I may have just mentioned Adam Scott as my top overall play, but Sergio isn’t far behind. In fact, why don’t we call it even?
Sergio  ->  positive

Back William McGirt 2u @ [160.0]  Place order to lay 12u @ [15.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [3.0]  Back William McGirt for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ 7/2    First up, a player who is fast becoming a favourite of this column. William McGirt has earned us a profit once, and gave us a great run at the Phoenix before a frustrating final day collapse cost us that top 20 payout. By setting a lay order to partially cash out should he shorten up in-play, a similar scenario could still yield a profit.
William McGirt  ->  positive

2nd at Glen Oaks, 2nd at TPC Boston and a fast-finishing 7th at Conway Farms last week where he finished with a bogey-free -6/65, Jordan has the kind of momentum recent winners of the FEC have had. Spieth only made 4 bogeys all week, was 3rd for Greens in Regulation and his scrambling was as good as we have seen since the Open Championship. He tops my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker and he's the Number 1 in this week's Published Predictor Model.
Jordan  ->  positive

Johnson has finished inside the top-23 in six of his seven starts this season, with the T57 finish at the Phoenix Open the exception. This suggests Johnson’s game is in very good shape, and an improvement in one area could be the difference on any given week. Zach has always been known for his short-game and in particular his putting, but so far this season he currently ranks just 81st in Strokes Gained: Putting, and should he find his touch on the greens, a win could be on the horizon.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

We saw Webb Simpson - like Bradley, another recent major champ who has had to come to terms with the new putter rule - come within an inch of winning at TPC Scottsdale so it's fair to presume these hugely talented players who tasted big success early have more wins in them. Getting Bradley at 80/1 is a bonus. I also looked at California native Brendan Steele at 66/1 but he does get in his own way mentally a bit.
Bradley,  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan and Graham DeLaet are both shorter than 20/1 at the head of the outright market this week and with neither having won on the PGA Tour, I am more than happy to side with Scott Brown who is available at 33/1 with Betfred and Bet Victor.The New Zealander is starting to find a little form again on the PGA Tour and he heads to Puerto Rico on the back of consecutive top 25 finishes in Florida. Tied 22nd in the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook, Lee closed with a final round of 67 last week to finish 17th at the Arnold Palmer Invitiational. The 26-year-old was 7th at the Valspar in 2015 before going on to win his maiden PGA Tour later that year at The Greenbrier Classic.
Lee  ->  positive

11th here in 2014 featured rounds of 63-70-68-69 and Cauley was 2nd after firing that -7/63 and was 7th going into Sunday. I also like his love for Pete Dye designs (Dye re-designed this course back in 1982) which is something that runs across Knox/Streelman/Duke and even Bubba Watson (a winner at TPC Louisiana). Cauley was 3rd at the CareerBuilder Challenge back in January which features the Dye Stadium Course as the host venue plus he's also finished 9th at Harbour Town, 5th (in partnership with Justin Thomas) and 11th at TPC Louisiana.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Marc Leishman e.w. @ 22/1  I certainly considered 28/1 shots Brian Harman and Pat Perez for my second pick. Harman scrambles and putts well and ended 2017 with form of 5-8-4.
Harman  ->  positive

Instead I take stock from his Augusta outing where after a Saturday -6/66 the Englishman was in 6th spot after 54 holes. Ultimately he disappointed slightly in the 3rd-last pairing with Henrik Stenson, but following on from his U.S. Open heroics last year, it's clear that Fleetwood can mix it at the very highest level. We all know that a first win in America is always a huge goal and Fleetwood arrives at a Quail Hollow course he played well enough at the PGA Championship last term with real momentum.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Thomas called his former Alabama team-mate, Lee Knox as soon as he qualified for the Masters last year, organising to stay with him throughout the week. The advantage of doing so, was Thomas managed to go out on practice rounds with Lee’s father, Jeff who we all know very well. Knox is the non-playing marker at Augusta National, and if required (when an odd number of players make the cut) often beats his playing partners, although his score is never official.
Thomas  ->  positive

With two spots remaining, we have $18,300 left to work with. Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler . FanDuel is back and they have a new format.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

I have a feeling he will be chalky, but I will look to differentiate elsewhere and keep my rose exposure. Jordan Spieth ($11,100) – We all know how well Jordan plays at Augusta every year and this is an Augusta-like course in Texas. Where is Jordan Spieth from – Texas.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

So, instead of targeting year-long stats, I’m focusing on rolling stats from the past five weeks. Looking at this data, the field leaders in SG:APP are Kyle Stanley, Bud Cauley, Justin Thomas, Mark Hubbard, Marc Leishman, Byeong-Hun An, David Lingmerth, and Rickie Fowler. Strokes Gained Off-the-Tee (SG:OTT): Similar to what I said above, strokes gained stats are the most important ones when we see a new venue.
Bud Cauley,  ->  positive

The price is going up but I think we can still consider him in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Chesson Hadley  World Golf Ranking (#80)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,000)  FanDuel ($8,700)    After losing his Tour card in 2016, Hadley won twice on the Web.com Tour last year and is back with the big boys and looking good. He started the fall season with three straight Top 5 finishes before withdrawing from the OHL Classic(illness).
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson ($12,500) – Don’t try to be the smartest guy in the room by fading DJ here, because there’s about a 90+% chance that you won’t be. In his last six appearances here – and we know how much better he has gotten in that time – DJ’s worst finish is T20.
DJ  ->  positive

He was injured shortly after the win and was forced to withdraw from the Bridegestone Invitational which burnt a lot of people. I am hoping with a combination of that and the enormous amount of great plays in the $6K range lead to low ownership for Berger. He is coming off a T5 at teh Travelers that could have easily been another win had he not crapped the bed with a 74 on Sunday.
Berger.  ->  positive

Pro Subscribers can review ownership trends via our DFS Ownership Dashboard shortly after lineups lock. The Value Plays  It’s a loaded field, which means that Adam Scott ($8,800) and Paul Casey ($9,000) are underpriced and likely to be incredibly chalky. Scott has two top-10 finishes over his last three trips here; his 68.4 Course Adj Rd score is the third-best mark among golfers with more than one visit.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

The combination of that with his stellar approach, and Casey will be in position to sink birdie putts constantly this week. That’s the one area where Casey has been atrocious: he doesn’t crack the top-100 golfers on Tour in any major putting category, although he’s T1 for putts inside 3’ at a whopping 100% conversion rate! * That would normally be a concern, but with the way the course is set up with easy putts to sink, Casey’s normal downfall won’t be as big of a factor as it would be elsewhere.
Casey  ->  positive

At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
Zach Johnson,  ->  positive

Initial thoughts are 'probably not' but he does have a second (Scottish Open) and a 10th (Irish Open) on windy links and also recent knowledge that he can take on the best after finishing runner-up in the US PGA. Tommy Fleetwood - 25/1  The market may just be underestimating Fleetwood here. He's the new European No.1 and topped the greens in regulation stats when enjoying that new status with a tied sixth place in last week's Hong Kong Open.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

What is most impressive about Henley’s record this year might be his performance in the years first two majors as he recorded his best ever finish at Augusta with a T11 and was in contention at the U.S. Open until a subpar final round. While he doesn’t have an extensive Open record, Henley has tended to play well on wind-exposed courses before (he has wins in Hawaii and Florida) and did record a top-20 finish at the Open back in 2015 at the Old-Course. He also currently ranks 17th in Par-4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards, a stat which may translate well to success on Birkdale’s tougher par 4s.
Henley’s  ->  positive

As the week breaks down more and we release our ownership projections I’ll have a better idea of what I’m doing personally with Tiger in DFS. Hideki Matsuyama – Top End GPP – DK $9700 FD: $11400  It’s always risky playing players in their return from a withdrawal. It becomes even riskier when there is a language barrier and the player has not directly interviewed about the matter.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he'll be in contention. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour.
Cantlay  ->  positive

The PGA Tour stays in Florida for this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational and Dave Tindall has three bets for the showdown at Bay Hill where eight-time winner Tiger Woods heads the market...  "This is a venue where past course form seems to count for more than average and Rose has a second in 2013, a third in 2011, an eighth in 2006 and, most recently, T13 (2017) and T9 (2016) the last two years." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Justin Rose e.w. @ 14/1  Presuming his form was decent, backing Tiger Woods at the courses where he's had most success would have seemed a decent strategy when he set out on his 2018 comeback.
Rose  ->  positive

Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

He knows if he wants to do something special, he has two more chances: East Lake and the Ryder Cup. Jordan Spieth. Look, if he didn’t have to compare his season to the monster one he put together a year ago, Spieth would be just fine.
Jordan Spieth.  ->  positive

You're banking on consistency but if a putting contest breaks out he'll also be in the mix as he ranked ninth in putts per round on the Web.com Tour last year. Lucas Glover ($8,900): While the last three golfers are relative young pups, Glover keeps things in the SEC but also brings some maturity. The Clemson product had an incredible bounce-back year in 2016, and what better way to end it then playing on a short track with bermuda greens.
Glover  ->  positive

16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. RESULT: T73  Chesson Hadley 2pts EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I always like Chesson Hadley when he's on a roll and like Luke List he's certainly a player who deserves a victory this season.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

The “choker” label was shedded at the Dean & DeLuca, and this par-4 stud should be able to post a score of at least -16 over four days which may not end up winning but will be a great DK score and necessary in a winning lineup in a weak field. Brian Harman ($10900) – Guaranteed to have some chalk behind his name, this past champion has had some great form this year which showed itself to a worldwide audience at Erin Hills with a T2 finish to go along with his earlier win at the Wells Fargo. Those two factors along with the overall weakness of the field means Harman will probably be the chalkiest player this week, but he also has some of the highest win upside both statistically and based on his past performance in Illinois: three top-25s (including that win in 2014) to go with two missed cuts in five total tries.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

When my two favorite darts are Martin Flores and Nick Watney, it’s probably time to log out.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

All of that bodes well when it comes to his prospects on debut at Glen Abbey, where the unpredictability of scoring conditions is no issue for a player whose wins have come in 12- and 21-under. English has suffered a difficult 2017, but he’s been able to perform at some of those courses I’ve mentioned and to be honest it’s amazing he’s made any cuts at all given how abysmal he’s been off the tee, which played a part in his making an 11 at the Travelers last month. However, there was a noted step up on his latest start when T29 at the Greenbrier, where English made gains off the tee in every round, eventually ranking 19th in the field.
English  ->  positive

His big finishes at the 2014 majors were preceded by a strong performance the week before (three times he had a top 10, including T6 in Houston) so his prep, which included some good sessions with Butch Harmon, looks spot on. With form of 4-1-16-12-3 heading to the Masters, Fowler looks all set for a massive week and his ability to handle windy conditions could be very useful given the forecast for the first two days (gusts of 30-35mph Thursday and 25-30mph Friday). How about an Englishman handing the green jacket to another Englishman?
Fowler  ->  positive

4th at the 2014 U.S. Open held at Pinehurst Number 2 also jumps off the page as the top 4 in that tournament include Martin Kaymer (2014 Players Champion), Rickie Fowler (2015 Players Champion) and Jason Day (2016 Players Champion). A dead-cert for the Ryder Cup European side in my view whatever the circumstances, I'm also a believer that the fact that Stenson sits outside of the automatic spots will be another motivating factor this week on a course he knows intimately. RESULT: T23  Bryson DeChambeau 1pt EW 55/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds.
Stenson  ->  positive

Bryan is going to win on Tour this year, and the PRO could be just the place to get the job done. Luke List ($9,900) – Speaking of breakthroughs, List might be the most talented player in the field without a PGA Tour win. He had a red hot Fall Swing and has been playing decently in 2017 as well.
Luke List  ->  positive

Recommended bets: The Masters      2pts e.w. Rickie Fowler at 22/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Bill Haas at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Kim has already notched two impressive wins, and a win here can get his 2018 off to a huge start. Chris Kirk 125/1 (Betfred & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  For the past year or so, Chris Kirk has struggled and his last win came in May 2015, but I am expecting the four-time PGA Tour winner to turn it around, hopefully as soon as this week. Kirk was one of the players to make the switch to PXG in 2016 and that may well be attributed to his struggles, but in recent starts he looks to be on an upward curve in terms of form.
Kirk  ->  positive

David Lingmerth is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. It will be interesting to see how Lingmerth responds after leading the first three rounds last week, only to falter in Sunday’s final round. Lingmerth has finished no worse than 16th here at the Old White, with two top-10 finishes in three starts.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the John Deere Classic - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 22/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Turning the clock back 2 years to 2015, Jordan Spieth won this event in a play-off from Tom Gillis with the very much in-form Danny Lee and Zach Johnson only a shot behind. Spieth was a 4/1 shot, with Zach Johnson at 11/1 and Danny Lee 80/1.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

I think some skepticism remains, which will keep his ownership in check a tiny bit. Alexander Noren – $9,200  The price tag is too cheap for Alex Noren, who ranks 1st in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds. He has been super consistent this season, proving his success on the European Tour is far from a fluke.
Noren  ->  positive

In a field where it’s hard to find players to roster in the $7k range without eating so much chalk you can’t breathe, Jones offers a nice GPP alternative who saves you some salary, has good potential to make the cut and has roughly 100:1 odds to win the tournament this week. The other standout this week is probably one who will indeed be chalky but is probably worth the dry taste in your mouth in Adam Hadwin who comes in with a $6,900 price tag and nearly 70:1 odds to win the tournament. Despite what I expect to be a popular play in Hadwin, I think this is a spot to get a guy who clearly has the game to win the tournament and is as inexpensive as they come in that category.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

His ball striking ability should be able to help him get around Royal Birkdale without too many issues. Steele is also one of the best drivers of the ball in the field, in terms of both accuracy and distance. Steele is a sneaky pick to bounce back nicely while everyone has moved on to greener grass.
Steele  ->  positive

He missed the cut last week in team play, but before that made five in a row including a T23 at the Shell Houston Open. J.B. Holmes ($8000): Holmes is another golfer that’s typically been long off the tee throughout his career, and is currently sitting with the longest Carry Distance at a whopping 305.7 (overall distance of 300.3, good for 26th) which will be a big factor here as mentioned. The PGA’s version of the Ginger Hammer (apologies to Roger Goodell) has made eight of nine cuts this season, and is coming into the week off a T5 in the team play last week.
Holmes  ->  positive

(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street. The 2017 Greenbrier Classic and Tour Championship champion, Schauffele has been inevitably quieter in 2018 but he's still playing some excellent golf. 17th at TPC Scottsdale, 9th at Riviera, 18th at Chapultepec and his WGC Dell Match Play campaign was ok too, beating Frittelli and Sharma before being beaten by Sergio Garcia.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Dufner's game fits nicely, and he has shown that with his success here over the years. In his past nine appearances here, Dufner has not finished outside the top 30 once, and during that time, he has posted four top-20s. In his past five tournaments this year, Dufner has made every cut and posted three top-20s.
Dufner  ->  positive

Between 2013-2014 on the PGA Tour, Stanley only managed two third-place finishes in 2013 and just a solitary top-10 in the whole of 2014. Stanley managed five top-20’s over the next two years but failed to post a top-10, however he looks to be making his way back. So far, in six events this season, Stanley has made five of his cuts, finishing inside the top-22 on four of those occasions.
Stanley  ->  positive

With the way things have been going for the rookie, I would have no issues running him out in cash games this week and is definitely in play for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark. Surely, he's entitled to be closer to the front of the market and he's a strong each-way fancy.
Johnson  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  MY PICK : Martin Kaymer ($9,500)  Martin Kaymer hasn’t won since his victory at the U.S. Open in 2014, but he does have a great streak of 28 starts without a missed cut going and should generally be considered the class of a fairly weak field this week. While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence.
Kaymer  ->  positive

This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Morgan  ->  positive

Bud Cauley at 100/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – gone nicely here before and bagged another top-10 finish last week  1pt e.w. Harold Varner III at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – took to the course last year and in better form now  There’s been something for everyone over the years since the Valero Texas Open found its home at TPC San Antonio, but this bulky par 72 lends a definite advantage to big hitters, standing it in stark contrast to last week’s event by the coast in South Carolina. Last year, Charley Hoffman finally converted his unquestionable comfort levels here by holding off Patrick Reed to win by one, completing a double of Greg Norman-design victories having previously stumbled over the line in Mexico at the OHL Classic.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

Next stop Korea. — Ian Poulter (@IanJamesPoulter) October 15, 2017  He said as much at the British Masters, telling reporters there that returning to the world's top 50 and earning a place in next week's field is his main objective, and perhaps he can draw from it to get into contention here. Poulter has never been particularly effective in Kuala Lumpur so his moderate performance there is not much of a concern, especially as he saved his best until last with a five-birdie 31 across his final nine holes.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth ($11000)  His game hasn’t been at his best this year, but these are the type of events he really brings the best of his game out in. Spieth’s been M.I.A. in the last several months apart from major events, presumably working on his game to get it into the form we saw last season.
Spieth  ->  positive

Blayne Barber and Zac Blair are two straight-hitting youngsters set to enjoy a productive week but a bit of nous tends to count for plenty here and that's also part of the reason for overlooking Morgan Hoffmann, who is typically an accurate driver and good putter and knows this course really well. Instead, I'll throw a dart in the direction of 41-year-old Ian Poulter at the same price as Herman. Poulter has made the cut on all six visits to Harbour Town, while for a brief time in the 2012 PGA Championship at Kiawah Island it looked like he might lay down a stern challenge to Rory McIlroy.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Sticking with our "studs and duds" approach this week, you can fit Na, Johnson, and Steele in a lineup and have and average of $7,233 left to spend on your three remaining spots. Ryan Palmer ($8,000)  Ryan Palmer loves this tournament. His last four appearances at the CareerBuilder: 17th, 10th, 2nd and 6th.

Adam Scott  ->  positive

He sits 17th in overall driving accuracy (68.23%), but he actually hits the fairway a whopping 83% of the time. Stanley hasn’t performed well here historically so should go under-owned relative to his talent. You can follow me on Twitter @adalyfrey, and if there’s something you’d like to see change in this column my DMs are open!
Stanley  ->  positive

Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely. Overall, his price is super affordable and he should be inspired for a rebound after missing the Masters last week.
Horschel  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy - $11,800 (7-1)    One way for Spieth to relieve some of that pressure was to say that McIlroy is the favorite. That's smart of Spieth, and calculating, but also probably true. McIlroy has won at Quail Hollow twice with six top-10s in seven career starts there.
Spieth  ->  positive

I thought 125/1 for 6 places (1/5 odds) or 90/1 for 8 places (1/4 odds) were fair prices given his two top-4 finishes in the majors last year, and the four-time PGA Tour winner has been playing some of the best golf of his career in the last couple of years. Along with his solid record in majors (now finished T24 or better in all four), Holmes has a 2nd at the 2015 WGC Cadillac Championship on his resume, showing he can do it on the biggest of stages. Total Points Staked this week: 8  Profit/Loss for 2017: -38
Holmes  ->  positive

He is going to make a pick and/or call every week and it will be in this section. “Michael Kim ($6,600) is my guy I’m guaranteeing a top 20 under 7k”  So, there you have it complete with a new section. As always hit me up on twitter if I can be of any help to you.
“Michael Kim  ->  positive

Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75. He’s an excellent play this week.
Steele  ->  positive

Ogilvy comes into North Carolina on the back of three top-30 finishes in his last four starts and he’s had success when he’s made the trek to North Carolina in the past, having made the cut in 10 out of 11 appearances at this event. Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well. While he’s more of a GPP play, Ogilvy is a player you can target given his improved recent form (13th overall in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green at the Valero) and affinity for this event/region.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

He’s never missed a cut in six appearances at PGA National with four T10s in his last five starts. Donald doesn’t fit the prototypical player I said I’d be focusing on, however he’s starting to flash the skills that brought him to prominence in the first place. The elite putting (6th), short (35th), and sand (5th) game has returned, and he’s cleaning up on Par 3s (21st) at the moment.
Donald  ->  positive

Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
Reed  ->  positive

This is a "home" game for Kuchar, so this year playing on two courses (Seaside and Plantation) should give him just a slight advantage over many of the other players. Jonathan Coachman -- Zach Johnson ($9,700)  This week I am going with someone who is always comfortable playing in this part of the country because he lives there -- Johnson. He hasn't had the year he would have wanted, but winning in the final event of 2016 can change all of that.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Brian Gay  3. Danny Lee  MY PICK : Kevin Chappell ($9,400)  Chappell had a slow start to the season, but over the past few weeks, he has seen a big resurgence in his game. While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam. UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience.
Fowler  ->  positive

Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
Scott  ->  negative

And, like Harman, Kisner was in contention throughout at Erin Hills. Cameron Smith - $7,600 (30-1)    Here's a case of the odds not being in sync with the DraftKings price – the oddsmakers like Smith more, and that catches our eye. Smith was pretty active during the fall, as many Australians tend to be, and he's riding a streak of four straight top-five cashes.
Smith  ->  positive

While JT gets the headline vote, I don't see any great need to make the case against the rest of those at the front of the betting. Each has their chance, and each is well worth considering, but truth be told only Spieth came close to selection alongside Thomas. Spieth's record here is outstanding - he's led at the conclusion of eight rounds from just 16 played - and he did what he needed to do at Houston last week.
JT  ->  positive

A big week here wouldn’t be a surprise to me at all. Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000): Bryson isn’t quite where he was last year when he was challenging for the win at Augusta, but he looked semi-close his last time out at the Valspar. While his putting continues to be a challenge his tee to green game has been solid his last two times out.
Bryson  ->  positive

He clearly loves playing in this laid-back type of event. Patrick Cantlay ($10,400): The Cali native finished T9 here way back in 2013. He made his return last year with a T48.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Jordan Spieth: 18th TPC4S/MC Sawgrass/2nd Augusta/13th GC of Houston. Chris Kirk: 13th Sawgrass/69th Heritage/33rd Augusta/8th TPC San Antonio. Adam Scott: 38th Sawgrass/14th Augusta/3rd Bay Hill/25th Doral.
Chris Kirk:  ->  positive

Rose came into the 2017 Masters winning just once in 2016 at the Olympic Games in Rio, but this time has three wins under his belt already on the season. With some recent winning experience fresh in the memory as well as some other top performances, you have to think Rose will be right in the mix on Sunday, in the quest for his first Green Jacket and the second major championship of his career. Rose clearly fits the bill here full stop but just from a statistical standpoint, Rose has dominated here at Augusta since 2012, as highlighted by this great nugget of information from Golf Channel’s, Justin Ray below.
Rose  ->  positive

Salary Vs. Vegas Odds  While I don’t suggest making decision based purely on Vegas Odds when it comes to golf, I think it’s a useful way to determine where you might find golfers with unexpected value. The first standout this week comes in the form of Lucas Glover who’s odds are roughly 100:1 to win despite the fact that Glover will cost you only $6,600 towards the salary cap to get him in your lineups. Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play.
Glover  ->  positive

Can’t believe the 250/1 on Ogilvy in Vegas is still standing. 200/1 Sabbatini very big also. Small dart at Hoge 200/1 too
Ogilvy  ->  positive

Knox is 18th in GIR, 28th in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green, and 27th in SG Around the Green. Russell Knox makes for a sneaky tournament play and his course history provides a safe floor if you choose to roll him out in cash games. Francesco Molinari ($7,500) has the best win probability of anyone priced under $8,800.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Paul Casey  ->  negative

Again taking the last seven winners as a sample, Woodland & Donald had both finished 6th in their previous starts in Florida, Spieth had finished 17th & 7th in his two previous starts, Hadwin had not missed a cut all season and had come close to winning at the Career Builder and Charl had won twice on the European Tour that year already and had finished 17th at Doral the week before. The clues were less obvious from Streelman and Senden, although Senden had only missed one cut all season and Streelman did have a top 10 to his name earlier in the year. All in all though it would seem what you should look for at Copperhead is a player who is in control of all parts of his game coming in to the event.
Streelman  ->  positive

Finau has been close to breaking out with a win a few times (sorry, I don’t count the Puerto Rico Open), and this seems like an ideal course/field for him to finally make it happen. Other Options: Matt Kuchar (Cash), Charley Hoffman (GPP)  Mid-Tier Targets:  JB Holmes (DK: $8,500, FD: $8,600)    JB is a much better value on DraftKings, but this a course that should suit him perfectly. Holmes is one of the biggest bombers in golf and has a great short game, as well.
Holmes  ->  positive

A 2016 win at the Jones Cup Invitational played at Ocean Forest Golf Club on Sea Island, Georgia is also interesting. Players such as Justin Thomas, Patrick Reed, Jordan Spieth, Victor Dubuisson, Paul Dunne and Austin Connelly all feature in the winners list of this strong amateur event, with a couple of those featuring at Birkdale last July. 2015 saw the then amateur Hossler finish 58th at the U.S. Open hosted at Chambers Bay and since his promotion to the PGA Tour, Beau has shown serious signs by the coast.
Patrick Reed,  ->  positive

Players with good records tend to go well here and Snedeker could follow up the disappointment of Torrey with a great performance this week. Phil Mickelson 20/1  Phil is a real horse for the course here in Pebble and could be another good linksy style player to keep on side here. He hasn’t finished worse than T21 in his last four events and seems to be getting better and better every week.
Phil  ->  positive

The combination of that with his stellar approach, and Casey will be in position to sink birdie putts constantly this week. That’s the one area where Casey has been atrocious: he doesn’t crack the top-100 golfers on Tour in any major putting category, although he’s T1 for putts inside 3’ at a whopping 100% conversion rate! * That would normally be a concern, but with the way the course is set up with easy putts to sink, Casey’s normal downfall won’t be as big of a factor as it would be elsewhere.
Casey  ->  positive

Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
Kirk  ->  positive

I hurt way too much last week. Price isn't the only thing to like about Reed as he has excellent course history with finishes of T22, T4, T7 and T21 last season. He ranks inside the Top 1o of West Coast Positive players and although the stats don't show it thus far, he is an amazing scrambler.
Reed  ->  positive

The same goes for Morgan Hoffmann, whose (reasonably) nearby residence in Jupiter surely played some part in another place at a massive price in Florida last time out. Like Cauley, he was once one of the bright young things of US golf and is tempting enough at 200/1, but consistency hasn’t been much of a strong suit in the past and the feeling is that particular ship has sailed. Some would say that comment applies to Jim Furyk, but I can’t leave him out at 80/1 around this golf course.
Cauley,  ->  positive

He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
Adam Scott,  ->  negative

He is the most expensive golfer on both sites but with some of the excellent values down below and a 54-hole cut event, he can be used in all formats this week. Pat Perez  World Golf Ranking (#19)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($8,600)  FanDuel ($10.300)  Perez is back on American soil this week and returns to an event he has been very comfortable at over the years. He has made the cut here in six straight years including a T14 last year and two Top 10 finishes and has made the cut in 13 of his 15 trips to Pebble Beach.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

He will have plenty of local support so will see a lot of familiar faces and while he readily admits he is still learning about life on the PGA Tour – his schedule will be less busy next season for one – he still has lofty aspirations of making the Tour Championship and even the Presidents Cup team. Life is good for Hughes at the moment with a child on the way as well and he looks in a decent place to outplay a very big quote in the betting. Where to watch on TV: Sky Sports Golf  Posted at 2125 BST on 31/07/17.
Hughes  ->  positive

Harman has finished no worse than T20 in the past three years, so expect the lefty precision player to convert plenty of birdies and continue his good form. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Gary Woodland, $10,200 – Not typically who you’d think of at a venue like Waialae, Woodland has finished 6th, 13th and third his past three trips. Woodland’s elite tee-to-green game is a huge asset at this venue, all he needs to do is putt a little better than normal to post a great finish.
Gary Woodland,  ->  positive

Haas has excelled with his iron play and scrambling, both of which are keys this week. Haas has two top-5 finishes in five attempts at this venue, and I expect more of the same this week. His recent form is some of the best in the field: 12th, 25th, 5th, and 13th place finishes in his last four starts.
Haas  ->  positive

An  ->  positive

Mid-Priced  Jon Rahm ($8,600) – Since he joined the tour last year he has a Birdie or Better over 25, putting him in the company of players like Spieth and DJ, and that is exactly where he’s found himself on the leaderboard as well. Since his win at the Farmers Insurance Open in January, he has gone T16, T5, T3 and then followed that up with a loss in the finals of the Match Play Championship to Dustin Johnson, a match in which he battled to the very end. Brandt Snedeker ($8,000) – With four top-20 finishes at Augusta since 2011, and just one missed cut, Snedeker is someone who seems to at least have the ability to make some of the shots necessary to score at Augusta National.
DJ,  ->  positive

If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,900) Hadwin has been one of my go to guys all season and I am not going to let his lack of course history pull me off him now. It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field. Outside of the obvious names, Hadwin has been one of the better players on The Tour this season, sitting in 5th place in The FedEx Cup standings, making 10/11 cuts total, 7/7 in the new year, including a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge, a 6th at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, and an excellent win at The Valspar Championship.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

With a recent roll of honour that reads Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer, Spieth and Johnson, it is hard to veer too far away from proven performers at the very top of the sport. To that end, Rickie Fowler and Jon Rahm look ideal candidates as outright tips as they attempt to join Sergio Garcia as a maiden major championship winner in 2017. Rahm���������s whirlwind rise up the rankings has been incredible even by modern-day standards as we constantly hail the next big thing in the game every other month.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Ross Fisher, who finished alongside Rahm in third ranked second for GIR. If you did miss the small greens, recovering well was key also with Rahm and Fleetwood (tied third and second) ranking first and second for Scrambling. Is There an Angle In?
Rahm  ->  positive

Tony Finau ($6,500): Sticking with the theme from above, Finau also loves putting on bentgrass and saves us some salary. Rory McIlroy ($11,100) : He's still one of the best at racking up birdies (and eagles) in bunches when he's on his game. I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards). Again like Blair, John Huh is also very accurate off the tee, and this is a course where a lack of distance won’t hurt and it’s a key to put the ball at the right yardage.
Zac Blair,  ->  positive

He is riding a streak of three finishes of T26 or better and has missed just one cut so far this season. Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town.
Molinari  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Matt Kuchar, Kevin Chappell, Charley Hoffman, Sergio Garcia, Brendan Steele, Zach Johnson, Ryan Palmer, Luke List, Jason Kokrak, and Chesson Hadley. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
Kevin Chappell,  ->  positive

Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) Ryan Armour; 3) Jim Furyk / Shubhankar Sharma; 5) Chad Campbell / Sergio Garcia; 7) Keegan Bradley; 8) David Hearn; 9) Michael Thompson; 10) Vaughn Taylor; 11) Martin Laird; 12) Chris Kirk / Kevin Na; 14) Fabian Gomez; 15) Andrew Landry; 16) Kevin Streelman / Andrew Yun; 18) Russell Knox; 19) Alex Cejka / Billy Horschel / Pat Perez / Jonathan Randolph. Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Sergio Garcia; 3) Trey Mullinax; 4) Luke List; 5) Tom Lovelady / Brendan Steele; 7) Keegan Bradley; 8) Charley Hoffman / Xander Schauffele; 10) Michael Thompson; 11) Scott Piercy / Adam Schenk; 13) Jason Kokrak / J.T.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

His year started with a bang, grabbing a T3 at the Career Builder Challenge, and he has top-10 performances in his two most recent events. Still, Cauley has recently struggled with bogeys . .
Cauley  ->  positive

It absolutely burned me last year, but I’m going to go back to the well. Berger’s ball striking has been excellent the last month or so, and he is quickly emerging as a star of the future. I think that Berger will fly slightly under the radar with many looking towards Justin Thomas, Adam Scott and Tommy Fleetwood in this price range.
Berger’s  ->  positive

He has reeled off five consecutive top 20s (with two top 10s), and he has made seven of eight cuts at the CareerBuilder. J.J. Spaun  I said last week that I’m riding Spaun until he wins, and I’m no flip-flopper. J.J. again was hot with his iron at Waialae, but, as is the theme with many this week, would have been better off putting with a hybrid.
J.J. Spaun  ->  positive

To my mind, Reed looks a prime candidate to emulate Rory and end a stop-start year by landing the jackpot over the next few weeks and he could start that here, defending his title on a new golf course which he's got the ability to adjust to immediately. Reed's record defending titles is strong - he's never been worse than 24th in four attempts, and almost won back-to-back renewals of the Tournament of Champions only to finish second - and with form at Firestone and Muirfield Village in the bag, he looks a solid alternative to the better-fancied runners, few of whom are more prolific. While The Northern Trust (formerly The Barclays) has thrown up some strange names in the top five and a totally shock winner in Heath Slocum eight years ago, Reed was the seventh successive high-class winner, every one of them either a Presidents or Ryder Cup player in their own right.
Reed  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Farmers Insurance Open. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brian Harman ($9,600)  Harman continues to play at a ridiculously high level. After five straight top-10 finishes, his streak snapped last week with a 20th at the CareerBuilder.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

He’s deadly accurate off the tee and with his irons, and obviously won’t be intimidated by anybody in this field. Justin Rose ($9,600) – Rose has two runner-up finishes at the BMW PGA Championship, and has won a British Masters at Woburn. When we look for accurate ball-strikers, he always comes to the forefront.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Whilst I wonder about Rahm on Bermudagrass greens, I have no hesitation in adding Rose to my betting slip this week as his record at the strategic East Lake is excellent. Jordan Spieth in his comments above notes that he thinks East Lake and Augusta have the same feel and twice Augusta runner-up Rose has finished 2nd (2012), 6th (2013), 4th (2014) and 2nd (2015) on his last 4 visits to the Tour Championship. This comment from Rose in an interview in 2012 backs-up the theory: "This is the kind of golf I do enjoy.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

JORDAN SPIETH – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – ¼ odds 1st 5 FINISHED 14th  The next player I like from a price point of view out of the market leaders is Jordan Spieth. Spieth’s troubles which have been mainly on the greens this season have been well documented. However last time out at the Genesis Open there were definite signs of encouragement in a performance which saw him finish 9th and register 17th on the strokes gained putting stats for the week.
JORDAN SPIETH  ->  positive

While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field. Adam Scott, $10300 – Returning to Memphis for the first time in 10 years -- he finished seventh in that edition -- Scott is hoping to tune up his game for Erin Hills and pick up a much needed win. Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year.
Scott,  ->  positive

Also Consider: Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, J.B. Holmes  Dark Horse:  Lucas Glover ($8,600) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %.
Glover  ->  positive

The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week. Ryan Moore - Ryan Moore had a top-30 finish last week in Mexico and should be able to build on that performance at Innisbrook where he’s produced top-five finishes each of the last two years.
Choi  ->  positive

The Phoenix Open in the main has always been the showground of the power players who can hit the ball high and close. J.B. Holmes (twice a winner), Hunter Mahan, Phil Mickelson (twice a winner), Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama all have plenty of pop from the tee when they need it. Kyle Stanley was a 305 yard average driver when he won here in 2013 and even Kevin Stadler in 2014 is not what you'd classify as a short driver of the golf ball.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Maybe his trusty Trackman is the Little Dutch Boy plugging that leak, maybe not. Whatever the case, Dustin Johnson is the defending U.S. Open champion and has evolved into the best golfer on the planet over the last six months. The Official World Golf Rankings tell me that -- he leads No.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Although the Sony Open is played on a completely different style of course, it's very common to find that good form in one Hawaii event is repeated in the other. So it also has to be good news that Kisner has finished fifth and fourth in his last two starts at Waialae. He's certainly worth looking at for that event next week but don't miss out on him here.
Kisner  ->  positive

He played great here last year shooting rounds of 68,68,66,66 to finish T6 and could easily improve on that this year. Its worth mentioning List has shot A 69 or better in 15 of his last 16 competitive rounds on the PGA Tour. Chez Reavie 66/1  Reavie is another player bang in form coming to California this week with two top 25’s and two top 10’s in his last five starts.
List  ->  positive

That makes him a very nice rebound candidate this week. Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations.
Scott  ->  positive

In just four starts here, over the last four years, he's finished 45th, seventh, fourth and fifth and his form so far in 2017 has been respectable enough. Billy Horschel's Greens In Regulation stats have been impressive of late and he'll feel he should have perhaps won here in 2013 when he was beaten into second by another of my fancies, last week's Puerto Rico Open winner, D.A Points. It's asking a lot for Points to double-up after last week but [200.0] was just too big and so too was the [250.0] I took about Cameron Tringale, who course form figures read a very respectable 73-8-16-4-5-57.
Points.  ->  positive

Cameron Smith, $9,300 – Smith started off with a trying 75 last week but reined it in the last three rounds as he climbed back into 17th. Dating back to the BMW Championship last season, Smith has put together four straight top-17 finishes and this week should offer him another chance to keep the good play going. Chris Kirk, $8,700 – Kirk posted a convincing fourth place at the RSM Classic in his last PGA Tour start, where he shot rounds of 63 and 64 in the first and third rounds.
Cameron Smith,  ->  positive

16th (2011), 5th (2012), 14th (2014), 1st (2015) and 15th (2016) highlights a player who enjoys this classical set-up and 66/1 with Betfred seems a little out of kilter for a player who's a 40/1 shot with plenty of other bookmakers. Kirk has been putting well enough - 47th Strokes Gained Putting - this season and sits inside our Putting Average 10-week tracker top 13, so it was interesting to see that his TPC Sawgrass performance a fortnight ago was driven by a great all-round showing. 6th for Ball Striking, 5th for Greens in Regulation and 5th for Putting Average generated Kirk's best ever finish at TPC Sawgrass and he also shot a -3/69 in the windiest conditions on Saturday.
Kirk  ->  positive

Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot. All told, that's eight wins in 10 matches at the course and he also won three group games from three at Harding Park in 2015, eventually losing to Jim Furyk in the quarters having seen off Rickie Fowler in the last-16.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Looking at his statistics on the year (PGA only, doesn’t include his absurd 6-shot victory at the Irish Open), Rahm crushes in almost every key category:  4 th in Par-4 Scoring / 5 th in Par-5 Birdie or Better %  in Par-4 Scoring / 5 in Par-5 Birdie or Better % 20 th in Bogey Avoidance  in Bogey Avoidance 2 nd in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green 3 rd in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach  in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach 3rd from 175-200 yards / 90th outside 200 yards  The only categories that Rahm has struggled with this year is around the green (109th in strokes gained) and he’s only an above average putter, not an elite putter (59th). Although there are punitive bunkers around the greens, Rahm will still put himself either on the green or in great position so often that he can manage to give a shot or three back with poor sand save efforts. Play him with absolute confidence.
Rahm  ->  positive

With great current form and a near winner last week Day could go one better and win in style this week. Patrick Reed 25/1  The young American really stepped up to the plate last week and got the job done in Bethpage with a great win. He has been knocking on the door a lot over the last few months with six top 15’s and a win in his last 10 events.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

His form through 2017 was quietly impressive with only one missed cut from the end of April to the end of the 2017 PGA tour season and after a couple of poor performances to start the 2017-18 season he signed of the 2017 PGA tour year with a 17th place at the RSM. As with Hadwin I feel the price on offer of 66-1 is more than fair. UPDATED 16th JAN  TRADER [S] Finish Hossler 20th - Lowest price traded 21  Jaeger MC  In a departure from the norm this week I am going to put forward 2 players as traders this week instead of the normal one.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Although getting all six of your golfers through the cut still holds value, it is not as important this week with the cut coming after 54 holes. Value Picks and Sleepers  Kevin Na ($8,800)  Na ranks third overall in our ranking system this week. He is a borderline top tier play at his $9,000 salary, but is on our radar as a "value play" because of the tremendous upside he offers.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

He’s now recorded three top tens in a row however and it has been mostly on the back of some great tee to green work which bodes extremely well for this week. Cauley has always been talented and this stretch of injury free golf may be finally what he needs to make the jump into a more elite tier of golfer. In a weak field, I’m not shying away from him as the confidence he’s built over the past month or so could easily lead to even better things here.
Cauley  ->  positive

What else of our selections last week? Stacey Lewis was placed in the Olympics at 14's and Snedeker and Rafa Cabrera-Bello both placed for us in The Wyndham at 33/1 and 40/1 Respectively, so whilst not winning we carry some decent place money forward this week. If you like what I do blog about why not check out my others for the football, golf and F1 here There is plenty of discussions on all of these topic over on the OLBG Forum pages (where you can win cash prizes so head over to the Forum for your chance to have a say.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Of note is the fact that even though he hasn’t hit it great in 2017, Johnson’s around the green and putting stats are both still inside the top 50 for the year, two factors which often pay huge dividends around Colonial. We’re not exactly buying low here but we are buying for lower ownership which I think makes sense given Johnson’s history at this event. He’s a great gpp pick in my eyes this week.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

Whilst the Swede is yet to perform at that same level in Majors and WGCs, just one top ten in 25 combined starts, he does arrive in Mexico on the back of his best WGC finish of T12th at last year's WGC HSBC Champions. Many believe the elevation of the course this week will have it play similar to Crans-sur-Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters, which Noren has won twice including last year. Noren has three top 25 finishes in four starts so far this season but could add some value in your Fantasy team in a strong field this week in Mexico.
Noren  ->  positive

Watching Phil over recent weeks I feel like I’ve been watching a loop of a tape where his putts keep hanging on the edge or burning the edges and if he can just get one or two more to drop this could at last be his week. PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price.
PATRICK CANTLAY  ->  positive

Prior to that he won the European Tour finale prior to the holidays, so this young gun is easily the cream of the crop this week in a semi-diluted field. Brian Harman, $11600 – Harman’s stock has gone up each of the past two weeks as he’s now posted four-straight top-5s dating back to last fall. The lefty is emerging as one of the most improved on the PGA Tour, and now feasts his eyes on the CareerBuilder Challenge, where he’s finished inside the top-11 the last two seasons.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

Well the season until recently has been the usual mixed bag from Si Woo which we have become accustomed to, however over the last couple of outings things have started to click in to place. Firstly Si Woo played well in the Matchplay to win his group before losing in the last sixteen. Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time.
Si Woo  ->  positive

Well rested and under the radar in a weaker field, Henley’s in a great spot to post his first big finish of 2017. MY SLEEPER : Cameron Tringale ($6,700)  Tringale is a hard player to get right, but he always brings upside for DFS. Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually.
Tringale  ->  positive

1 Jason Day No. 1, Back-to-back Top Five Finishes  While he failed to add to his major total in 2016, Day has succeeded in establishing himself as the PGA Tour’s most consistent threat to win. He nearly chased down Jimmy Walker at the PGA Championship last month, ending up in a tie for seventh, and he followed that up with a solid tie for fourth at The Barclays last week.
Day  ->  positive

Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.
Jim Furyk  ->  negative

Interestingly other than the 4th at the RSM Kirk’s best two 72 hole stroke play finishes of 2017 on tour came at this event where he finished 21st [on the back of a missed cut at the Sony] and at Sawgrass where he finished 18th. Kirk also has two other top 15 finishes at Sawgrass to show his liking for a Pete Dye design. Finally another point that caught my eye is that Kirk has a top 5 finish at the Nicklaus designed Muirfield village host of the Memorial, an event which has been won by Dufner and Lingmerth over recent years, who finished 1st & 2nd in this event respectively in 2016.
Kirk’s  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR. It was therefore with some amusement that those of us on this side of the pond watched the US lead coverage from Torrey Pines 3 weeks ago, during which we were treated to interviews and commentary that portrayed Alex as a complete rookie, who would potentially react like a rabbit in the headlights when faced with the possibility of winning on US soil!
Noren.  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 5 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at course history. Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
Bubba  ->  positive

He finished T12 on 2009, T23 in 2012, T15 in 2013, solo second in 2015, where he didnt shoot worse than a 67 throughout the week, and a T13 last year. Piercy ranks eighth in SG off the tee, ninth in SGTTG and tenth in SG Approaches to the green. With a great record here and good current form Piercy could be another player to keep an eye on here.
Piercy  ->  positive

The organisers tend to shape the draw so that the top players play consecutive rounds around Pebble on the weekend and if they do so again and Saturday ends up being really blustery, the current market leaders could get the worst of the draw. Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Embed from Getty Images  Kevin Kisner $8,400 – We’ve spoken to a couple of caddies on the PGA Tour that say the most important factors at Kapalua are putting, wedge play, and staying aggressive. Enter Kevin Kisner. He’s only outranked by two other players in the field over the last five years in SG: Putting and 3 Putt Avoidance (Spieth & Brooks).
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

His debut here in 2016 yielded an excellent top-10 finish after firing 66-64 heading into the weekend but the real selling point for me is Bryan’s ability when it comes to the second shot with a short iron in his hand, so important around here. Stick Bryan in the fairway in the region of 150 yards or closer and you have a player who can dial it in on a regular basis, a fact backed up this season with a very high ranking in all the relevant statistics in that department - to be honest, he is verging on deadly. His form has been inconsistent since that victory in mid-April but I expect an upturn returning to a course that plays to his strengths and could well give him a decent chance of quickly doubling his PGA Tour win tally.
Bryan’s  ->  positive

Ross Fisher, who finished alongside Rahm in third ranked second for GIR. If you did miss the small greens, recovering well was key also with Rahm and Fleetwood (tied third and second) ranking first and second for Scrambling. Is There an Angle In?
Rahm  ->  positive

Luke List looks incredibly short despite a good record at the course, and I'd rather take a chance on a man so easily confused with him, Jamie Lovemark. When An went closest to his breakthrough in Louisiana, so did Lovemark, somehow losing a play-off to Brian Stuard having missed a glorious opportunity to close the door in regulation. He's also had a chance to win here, leading through 54 holes in 2016, and one of the more powerful players on the circuit is clearly advantaged by a relatively low-scoring test on a par 72 which doesn't punish his wayward driving.
Jamie Lovemark.  ->  positive

Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall. Duf Daddy has two runner-up finishes at Colonial (2012 and 2014) and finished sixth last year. Moreover, he has made nine straight cuts and has seven top-25 finishes during that stretch.
Dufner:  ->  positive

Last year he finished 32nd on tour in birdie average as well as T-29 in proximity to the hole on his approach shots. He should have plenty of looks at birdie this week, and I like him to make plenty of them  Martin Laird-  Laird finished T-8 at the Safeway Open in October and is another horse for the course with a win in 2009 followed by a 2nd place finish in 2010. He also came in T-18 in 2013 as well as T-43 last year.
Martin Laird-  ->  positive

From an identikit winner perspective, we're looking for a player who's comfortable on Bermudagrass greens, can hit the ball close with their approach play and who, when they win, shoot extremely low totals. The 23 year-old, University of Alabama produced Thomas ticks all of these boxes. Tough 3rd and 10th place finishes at PGA National and Copperhead last term show an aptitude for TifEagle greens and Justin is definitely Bermudagrass positive as he also has top 10 finishes across Waialae (his 2015 season opener in next door Honolulu), PGA West, Quail Hollow, TPC Sawgrass, East Lake and CC of Jackson.
Justin  ->  positive

I can’t be certain of course but he has a great track record of winning almost immediately again after a previous win and I would be kicking myself if I wasn’t on. ADAM SCOTT – 60-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 32nd  Adam Scott is undoubtedly one of the most frustrating golfers of recent times, however he is also one of the most talented and his ability to win big golf tournaments including Majors is not in doubt. He languishes in the betting market at around the 60-1 mark due to his lack of activity in general and certainly around the top of leader boards of late.

As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.

Molinari most recently posted his first top-25 of 2018 at the WGC-Mexico Championship, while he currently ranks 15th on Tour in SG: T2G and is top-10 in terms of proximity from 175-plus yards out. The Italian is 35-under-par in his last 20 rounds at the API, including three top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the event. Francesco Molinari - $13,800    Since 2010, Molinari is second to only Henrik Stenson in terms of overall scoring in relation to par at Bay Hill.

PICKS  I have gone with 5 players this week as follows;  RICKIE FOWLER – 14-1 – 2pts Win FINISHED 11th  Whilst off course strong cases can be made for Rahm, Matsuyama and the other market leaders of those heading up the betting I like Rickie the most at the price. As much as Fowler has shown a dislike for Torrey Pines over recent years he has very much shown a liking for TPC Scottsdale and he undoubtedly has unfinished business here following his agonising loss in a play off to Hideki a couple of years ago. Take away the missed cut last week and Rickie has been in fantastic form since the back end of 2017.
Fowler  ->  positive

All of the last five winners ranked inside the top-12 for Putting Average with four of the five ranking inside the top-4, so clearly a strong putting week is required here also. The following events are the ones to have featured Bermudagrass Greens this season and should be looked at, in order to find those who have performed well on this putting surface this season:  Sanderson Farms  RSM Classic  Tournament of Champions  Sony Open  CareerBuilder Challenge  Phoenix Open  Honda Classic  The following players in the field this week have ranked inside the top-10 for Putting Average on more than one of these courses this season:  Chesson Hadley (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ollie Schniederjans (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Sam Saunders (x2) (T11 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ben Martin (x2) (T19 in Putting Average overall this season)  Aaron Wise (x2) (T27 in Putting Average overall this season)  Chris Kirk (x2) (T109 in Putting Average overall this season)  Gary Woodland (x2) (T151 in Putting Average overall this season)  It is clear from the list above that both Kirk and Woodland raise their game in a big way when on Bermuda Greens, whilst others on the list tend to be putting well all season. Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus.

Matsuyama  ->  positive

Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week. He is surrounded by two guys with more than twice the amount of mentions then him, Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore, who will likely soak up a ton of ownership.
Walker  ->  positive

He hasn’t been in the best form, but has played TPC Boston seven times and only once missed the cut, and is simply too good to be offered at this price. Fade: We give you Bubba Watson. Some places fit him, and some don’t.
Bubba Watson.  ->  negative

I especially like him in cash games because his $7,500 price tag gives you a solid cut-maker with upside and saves some salary-cap space for other high-end options. -- Jeff Bergerson  Emiliano Grillo  Although Grillo faded down the stretch at the Hero Indian Open and is flying across the world to play this week, he still offers excellent value at his price tag. He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season.
Grillo  ->  positive

And he also showed it when winning this tournament two years ago. Reed posted 21-under on that occasion before showing his one-to-one skills by defeating compatriot Jimmy Walker in a play-off. There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out.
Reed  ->  positive

Haas has had trouble getting himself into contention in big events over his career but he landed his first top ten in a major last season (T9 at the Open) and has top-five finishes in two of the last three WGC events. Haas ranks high in some key stat areas for me as well, as he’s second in scrambling and ninth in par 4 scoring on the year. Kevin Kisner ($6,900): Kisner has had a great start to the 2017 season.
Haas  ->  positive

My biggest reservation here is that he would have to play DJ to get into the final 4, which would be less than ideal. However, Poulter is 23-14 in match play and can’t be counted as an easy out for anyone in the field. Marc Leishman ($8,600), 11 seed, Group 11.

While he has just one finish inside the top 10 at Augusta National, T11 and T12 in the last three years back up the idea that he'll always give you a run for your money in these markets on this course. Last four events: 43-14-37-MC  Course form: 11-MC-12-5-38-27-38  Last 10 majors: 5-22-5-11-33-46-MC-MC-30-30  Last 50 starts - Win: 2%, Top 5: 22%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  I couldn't quite pull the trigger on Justin Rose in the outright market but I have no hesitation making him my best top 10 punt here. Rose has the most robust greens in regulation stats at Augusta National of any player in the field this week and that will get you the top 10s.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Buy him before Bubba Watson ($8,300) or Padraig Harrington ($8,500). Throwing Darts  Daniel Berger: $7,000  Berger didn't have his best stuff at Torrey Pines where he missed the cut, but it's not a course he plays well. He tied for 10th at the WMPO in 2015, so he's proved capable at the desert course.
Berger:  ->  positive

This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one. I have a slight concern with Kirk in that he’s never played here before, but raw talent should get him into contention this week. He’s a great putter and wedge player and should take advantage of the par-5s.
Kirk  ->  positive

Justin Rose 20/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Rose has not played since the FedEx Cup play-offs so comes into this week fresh from a run of form that saw him finish inside the top-10 in each of the four FedEx Cup play-off events with a 2nd and three 10th place finishes. There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off. Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He’s still riding the heater. DFS STRATEGY  Cash Games – There’s nothing wrong with starting your lineups with Jon Rahm ($11,800) here again. He’s started 2018 off perfectly.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

He has been overlooked lately and I think the trend continues. Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Bud has cooled off in his last 3 events and this is right when I want to get back on board. He is a scorer and this course does not present the dangers the last 3 events have played.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – WGC-Bridgestone Invitational  Lock of the week:  Rickie Fowler – $10,600 – Rickie’s in impeccable form as of late in tough fields, his SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his three T10’s at Firestone Country Club in the last five years make him a clear lock in any format. He’s a slight cost savings as well, just cracking the five digit mark at $10,600. We won’t care how popular Fowler will be this week as his golf has been consistent with 14/16 cuts made this season and three Top-10s in his past four starts.
Rickie  ->  positive

I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
Stenson  ->  negative

If he can carry that form over to this week, he could well make an impact at the top of the leaderboard. Rose won the 2015 renewal of the Zurich Classic and also finished 4th at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits that same year, so he has some good recent form at Pete Dye designs. In terms of Par 4 Performance, Rose ranks 8th on Tour, and also 17th in Par 4 Efficiency 450-500 yards, which is an important range for this course.
Rose  ->  positive

Sang-Moon Bae ($7,200): Not many players have navigated their way around Riviera better than Sang-Moon, who has finished eighth, eighth and 12th in his past three trips: Bae’s 67.7 Course Adjusted Round Score ranks third among players with more than one start here. Finau missed the cut at the Phoenix Open his last time out and has missed the cut here at Riviera in each of the past two seasons, so despite his typically high ownership in Daily Fantasy Sports contests, Hump thinks Finau could fly under the radar this week. Tony Finau ($8,200): Finau hits it long (311.5 yard LT DD), puts the ball on the green (68.9 LT GIR percentage), and has been playing reasonably well (69.1 Recent Adj Rd Score).
Bae  ->  positive

An excellent ball-striker, Peterson led the field in greens as he finished inside the top 20 here on his last visit and, like Poulter, has been playing some good golf since returning from injury. Peterson's results have been more impressive, with two top-25 finishes in his last three starts, and perhaps with a baby on the way he'll find a level of calm on the course that has so far escaped this talented underachiever. Certainly, this is the type of test which was made for his game and a small each-way bet at 150/1 makes plenty of appeal in an event which tends to favour a very specific type of player.
Peterson  ->  positive

While inaccuracy off the tee is always a concern, Na has putted much better on Bermuda over his career and should be motivated to turn his end of season slump around with a big week here.

Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times. With a very reasonable price given his recent form and the tournament field, Reavie makes for a great cash game play.

It looks like he is well on track to start playing at the top of his game, and it showed during the first two rounds of the WGC where he was tied for third on the leaderboard entering the weekend. Value Plays  Daniel Berger  Daniel Berger ($7,700)  Berger has great form coming into the PGA Championship, placing top 5 in three of his last five events, including a win defending his title at The St Jude. He was T13 at the WGC Bridgestone going into the weekend when this article was published.
Berger  ->  positive

What I like most is the value price this week as he comes in the low $8K range on DraftKings and the mid $9K range on FanDuel making him a top target in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Tommy Fleetwood  World Golf Ranking (#11)  Vegas Odds (18/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($11,300)    Before coming over to the PGA Tour in mid-February, Tommy Fleetwood was on fire in Europe posting three straight finishes of 6th or better including a win at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. During those three events, he also recorded 12 straight rounds in the 60's.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

The Canadian performed creditably in 36th on last year's Augusta debut and his short game excellence should ensure something respectable again...He's in reliable, consistent form, making every cut this year and finishing top-12 on four of his last six events." Wiesberger can continue impressive start  Back Bernd Wiesberger for a Top 40 Finish 8u @ 6/4  To a golf punter like myself - who will barely take his eye off the leaderboard all weekend, let alone the TV coverage - these distant finishing position markets are absolutely perfect. There are only 96 players at Augusta, dozens of whom have no chance whatsoever and most of whom I have a firm opinion.
Wiesberger  ->  positive

1 Jason Day No. 1, Back-to-back Top Five Finishes  While he failed to add to his major total in 2016, Day has succeeded in establishing himself as the PGA Tour’s most consistent threat to win. He nearly chased down Jimmy Walker at the PGA Championship last month, ending up in a tie for seventh, and he followed that up with a solid tie for fourth at The Barclays last week.
Jason Day  ->  positive

Thanks largely to his Mayakoba win, the runner-up finish at the Wells Fargo and a 3rd at this event last season, Perez finished 15th in the FedEx Cup standings which is by far and away his best performance since its inauguration in 2007. Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign.
Perez  ->  positive

The 2016 win featured Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and 3rd at Glen Oaks last August, in addition to his 3rd here in 2011, highlights that Jhonattan is comfortable on Poa Annua. 4th at the monster Congressional classical course in 2012 also jumps from his CV and a confident Vegas, who's finished 11th and 7th on his last 2 outings, could be arriving at Torrey Pines at just the right time.

Jhonattan  ->  positive

6th at the 2012 Callaway Pebble Beach Invitational, he also finished 3rd here in his rookie 2013 PGA Tour season where he led after 54 holes. Confident with the putter right now, we know that Hahn can win on the classical courses like Riviera and Quail Hollow. He also has a great reason to be motivated this week: Hahn struggles in Florida, so at Number 60 in the OWGR, if he wants to get into The Masters it's pretty much now or Riviera next week.
Hahn  ->  positive

Since winning the Masters in April, Garcia has been able to back that win up with some strong play, including a T2 finish in his last start at the BMW International. Although he broke his major goose-egg at Augusta, it is the Open which has always been Garcia’s favorite major, as he has an incredible 10 finishes of T10 or better at this event since 2001. While younger players like Rahm and Spieth certainly come in with confidence, the Open has been an experienced player’s paradise recently with the last six winners all being 39 years of age or older.

No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head. Moreover, his lack of driving accuracy (140th) and iffy iron game (60th in strokes gained: approach) forecast trouble.
Johnson  ->  positive

Berge is a solid player in every category, but does a great job on the green which should help him have a strong run at Augusta. Last year, Berger had a strong finish in 10th place and will be a high owned pick in cash and GPPs because of his play last week and overall strong play in the 2017 season. Francesco Molinari will be one of the better scorers of the tournament on par 5’s and has a shot to knock down some eagles.
Berger  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama 10/1 (General) 3pts win  It feels so ridiculous tipping Matsuyama, it feels even more ridiculous that he’s 10/1. In Matsuyama’s last 10 Worldwide starts he has five wins, eight top-5’s of which 2 were runner-up finishes. He has elevated his game to a completely different level and until he shows signs of slowing up, it is hard to bet against him, no matter where the venue.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Those with a top three are bolded up. Patrick Cantlay, Paul Casey, Kevin Chappell, Jason Day, Bill Haas, Dustin Johnson, Matt Kuchar, Marc Leishman, Phil Mickelson, Kevin Na, Louis Oosthuizen, Pat Perez, Jon Rahm, Chez Reavie, Patrick Reed, Justin Rose, Webb Simpson, Jordan Spieth, Robert Streb, Justin Thomas, Jhonattan Vegas  Of those above 21 players, the one with the best course form is Jason Day so, in a move that squeezes out every last drop of the bleeding obvious, it's the Aussie that is my number one pick. History tells us that it pays dividends to keep it simple at this time of year so Day, who boasts a victory in 2015 (by six shots!)
Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

The Tiers  $12,000 - $10,000  CASH: He was our GPP play last week but this week for cash I am going straight to the top with Jordan Spieth. Spieth comes into Pebble with great form having posted a 9th last week after getting off to a rocky start was able to find his groove and surge on the weekend with two prior 3rd places in the fall.. Jordan's game is well suited for this event and he is sneaky long enough to hit the big par 5's in two. After getting his irons and wedges dialed in on the weekend at the Waste Management, I'm confident he will be throwing darts on this rain soften course.
Jordan  ->  positive

What's really caught my eye though is Hahn's recent putting form which sees him sitting 9th in my rolling 10-week Putting Average tracker. Rounds of -5/65 and a closing -8/62 powered Hahn into a play-off in last month's Sony Open where he was outlasted by Patton Kizzire. Last week on a home Scottsdale track that he likes, James finished 11th with -4/67 and -5/66 rounds across Friday and Saturday powering the Californian through the mid-pack.
James  ->  positive

I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag. While I don’t love McGirt’s chances to win this thing, I definitely thing he has top 10 upside and is probably worth taking a hard look at in GPPs.
McGirt  ->  positive

He's a lock for cash games this week and do not be surprised if he uses his momentum to make a run at a top-10 finish. -- Zach Turcotte  Rafael Cabrera Bello  Cabrera-Bello returns to Augusta for his third straight start at this event and FanDuel has a mouthwatering salary for him this week. The lower $7k range on FanDuel is typically reserved for golfers with slim chances at contending for the week and Cabrera-Bello is far from that.
Cabrera-Bello  ->  positive

With some recent winning experience fresh in the memory as well as some other top performances, you have to think Rose will be right in the mix on Sunday, in the quest for his first Green Jacket and the second major championship of his career. Rose clearly fits the bill here full stop but just from a statistical standpoint, Rose has dominated here at Augusta since 2012, as highlighted by this great nugget of information from Golf Channel’s, Justin Ray below. Reasons to like @JustinRose99 this week: – Most birdies/eagles made at ANGC since '12  – Highest GIR% in Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 5 score to par at Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 4 scoring avg at Masters last 5 years  – Best score to par overall in Masters since 2011 — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) April 2, 2018  He may only be 14/1 this week but when we talk of the word “overdue”, nothing quite personifies it like Rose at Augusta.

Mackenzie Hughes at 300/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - big price about a player who knows this course well  Click here for our transparent tipping record  Three years ago, Rory McIlroy won the Open Championship and followed up at the Bridgestone Invitational before completing a tremendous hat-trick in the PGA Championship at Valhalla. Jordan Spieth now has the Claret Jug safely stashed away and is 8/1 favourite to double his haul at Firestone in Akron, Ohio, after a truly remarkable final few holes at Royal Birkdale.
Mackenzie Hughes  ->  positive

But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough. English has not only put up 6-of-6 made cuts, he’s finished inside the top-15 three times at TPC Scottsdale! Now, English did underperform last year, but he’s a two-time PGA Tour winner with youth and upside to bounce back.
English  ->  positive

Look no further then Jason Day. I think with Day’s price and relative performance this year he should realistically see smaller ownership as Rahm, Stenson, Kuchar and Garcia all eat up some of his exposure within the same price range. In Day’s latest appearance at The Open Championship he showed signs of his game returning with a T27 finish.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Indeed, when third here nobody hit more greens and nobody hit the ball closer. While Oosthuizen still seeks his first win in the US, Schwartzel has two and although frustrating at times, he's playing well enough to be a major factor here. In his last 10 starts, the former Masters champion has three top-six finishes and all in strong fields.
Schwartzel  ->  positive

Last Five Winners  2017 - Dustin Johnson -17  2016 - Bubba Watson -15  2015 - James Hahn -6 (playoff)  2014 - Bubba Watson -15  2013 - John Merrick -11 (playoff)  What Will it Take to Win the Genesis Open? The general perception is that length off the tee here is very beneficial and last year's winner, Dustin Johnson, did rank number one for Driving Distance but the average DD ranking of the dozen winners before him was a fairly lofty 24.75 and in each of the last six years at least one player has placed with a DD ranking of 50th or higher. Kevin Na and Wesley Bryan tied for fourth 12 months ago ranking 56th and 66th for DD and James Hahn ranked 50th when he won the event three years ago.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

He has still finished no worse than 21st this season, after finishing 16th in Phoenix last week and he looks in perfect shape to compete at one of, if not his favourite stop. Mickelson is clearly desperate for a win, as he showed again this past Sunday. He got himself close to contention after an impressive front-9 but his back-9 was his undoing.
Mickelson  ->  positive

He's got 10 million reasons to play well. Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017.
Spieth  ->  positive

My Top 25 for the 2017 Quicken Loans National  1. Rickie Fowler  2. Bill Haas  3.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Though these skills translate everywhere, this type of game excels in low-scoring events like this one, where converting birdies and making clutch pars on the greens are important to maintaining momentum. Pat Perez, $9300 – This week’s defending champion has finished no worse than 24th in the last two months, including his victory at the CIMB. Converging trends of history and form don’t get much better than Perez this week, meaning he’ll be heavily owned on Fanduel, but a good pick nonetheless.
Perez,  ->  positive

He played in this tournament last year, and if it weren’t for an opening round 76, his T55 finish would look much, much better. What is different from last year, is that Noren was not playing nearly as much as he has been in 2018, making his results from last year tough to compare. I’m all in and Noren is a lock for cash.
Noren  ->  positive

The Travelers Championship tees off from TPC River Highlands in Connecticut, so here are a few names to consider from every price point. High-Priced  Jordan Spieth ($11,400) – Obviously Spieth, McIlroy and Day – the three top options on the board – have the upside of carrying you to a fantasy title, but each has enough variance in their game to make them more of a tournament play right now. All three should probably find their way into a lineup or two, but of them, Spieth is my favorite right now.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bill Haas ($9,500): Haas is coming in off a two-week rest and he needed it apparently as he missed the cut by a mile his last time out at the Heritage. Still, Haas has been consistent most of the season, with the RBC being his only missed cut over seven starts. With his recent third place at the WGC Match Play event still semi-fresh, I won’t be shocked if Haas puts the confidence gained there to good use this week in a much weaker field.
Haas  ->  positive

I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
Ian Poulter:  ->  negative

Expectations have to be tempered until he shows the same sort of form in bigger events, so a Top-20 bet looks the more realistic option this week but this could well be a breakout year, should he put together a couple of good weeks early. Tom Jacobs – Jason Kokrak to be the First Round Leader 55/1  This is a simple one for me. Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early.
Jason Kokrak  ->  positive

3 adds just now over at sportsbook: Knox 50 Ollie 60 Kizzire 60 They join from yesterday: Tommy 30, Harman 35, Billy Ho 100
Harman  ->  positive

If Piercy takes to this layout - and I strongly suspect that he will - and produces the level of golf he displayed in four of his previous five starts this year, he seems likely to go very close. There are dangers, of course, but when Rory Sabbatini, Graeme McDowell and Harris English are among them, it's clear that we're talking about an exceptionally weak event, the like of which Piercy has won twice before. McDowell was on the radar for all the obvious reasons - his form by the coast, the improvement he's shown over the last month, his handy knack of actually winning golf tournaments - but 25/1 looks about right, although he represents better value than Sabbatini at the prices.
Piercy  ->  positive

He drained 27 birdies at this track last year and finished T8. Zach Johnson ($6,300): This is probably the first and last time you’ll see Johnson as the cheapest golfer in the field. Zach hasn’t finished better than 33rd in his last seven tournaments, but he could make his way into a lot of lineups this week for those looking to load up on the expensive studs.
Johnson  ->  positive

Jason Rouslin -- Kevin Kisner ($6,900)  Arriving in Shanghai off a decent performance in Malaysia, Kisner comes to China and the Sheshan International Golf Course where he placed second last year. With that in mind, and a great value, I like Kisner to jump start his 2016-2017 season with a top 10 finish this week. Kisner sports a great tee-to-green game and is a great driver of the golf ball.
Kisner  ->  positive

Some courses are just going to be too big for him, but a place like Copperhead is where he can thrive, evidenced by his playoff runner-up finish last year. Graham DeLaet ($8,400) – Don’t look now, but DeLaet is starting to regain his PGA Tour relevance at a very rapid pace. With top 20 finishes at Phoenix, Riviera, and PGA National, DeLaet is clearly returning to form as one of the best ball strikers in the game, even if his scrambling and putting still aren’t quite up to snuff.
Graham DeLaet  ->  positive

2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014. RESULT: T5  Kelly Kraft 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Kelly Kraft is another I like on the basis that he's been showing some decent enough form which hasn't scared the odds compilers too much and has a nice habit of late of playing well in the wind.
Kelly Kraft  ->  positive

This season Keegan has already finished in the top 5 twice and he has ticked along nicely in the Florida swing with three solid performances. Bradley’s long game stats this season are mightily impressive and he currently sits 4th in Ball Striking on the PGA Tour. Not unsurprisingly for someone who was hit badly by the anchored putting ban, the area holding him back so far from revisiting the winners enclosure is the putter and to date this year Bradley sits 207th out of 214 listed players in the PGA tour’s Strokes Gained Putting stats.
Bradley’s  ->  positive

Luke List looks incredibly short despite a good record at the course, and I'd rather take a chance on a man so easily confused with him, Jamie Lovemark. When An went closest to his breakthrough in Louisiana, so did Lovemark, somehow losing a play-off to Brian Stuard having missed a glorious opportunity to close the door in regulation. He's also had a chance to win here, leading through 54 holes in 2016, and one of the more powerful players on the circuit is clearly advantaged by a relatively low-scoring test on a par 72 which doesn't punish his wayward driving.
Lovemark.  ->  positive

Zach Johnson should go well after another promising effort last week  Johnson remains an above-average putter, but it's a while since he's been a deadly one and combined with the fact that he cannot overpower any golf course, that explains why too often he's been on the fringes of contention without adding to his impressive haul of 12 PGA Tour wins. Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

The other notable absentee is former winner Adam Scott, who is done for the PGA Tour season, but otherwise this is an elite list and, as you'd expect, a top-heavy market. Hideki Matsuyama probably deserves favouritism given the six titles he's won since this event last year, but picking between him, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas and Henrik Stenson isn't easy. McIlroy might even shade my vote as he's more than twice the price he started the PGA Championship, where he finished inside the top 30 don't forget, and he brings form from all those courses mentioned to the table.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Reavie ranks 7th and 9th in approaches from the fairway in these two ranges respectively, further supporting his case this week. Whilst there are obvious question marks about whether Reavie can win, especially in this company, his game is in perfect shape to play this course. Despite the obvious positives, aside from a 7th place finish in 2016, his record here makes dismal reading.
Reavie  ->  positive

His past history in this event is tempting, but there are too many other healthy horses to saddle this week. Jim Furyk – His record in this event sounds like he’s an automatic, but his current form screams the opposite. Big ballpark, and recent struggles makes Oakmont feel like it was a very long time ago in his native Western Pennsylvania.
Jim Furyk  ->  negative

He is probably too risky for cash games but is an excellent, high upside GPP play. Who the Stat Like  Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#74)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,100)  I already talked about Hadwin and Steel who rank #1 and #3 in my overall model so we will jump right to the guy in the middle of them, Tony Finau. Looking at the field ranks for this week, Finau is 1st in SG: OTT, 2nd in SG: OTT + APP, 5th in Driving Distance, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd and 14th in GIR from 175-200 and 200+ and 15th in both Bogey Avoidance and Birdie or Better %.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there. As he sits 21st in Par 4 Scoring Average, it makes sense that he plays well on courses with two extra ones.
Bradley's  ->  positive

Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson. In three years, he has two top 10s here at Sheshan Golf Club, including a win in 2014.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

With only two Par 5s in play this week, Par 4 Scoring and Par 3 Scoring get a boost in the key stat department. Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Bogey Avoidance (BA), Par 4 Scoring, Approaches 125-150 yards, Scrambling, Par 3 Scoring  Top-Tier Plays  Jordan Spieth ($10,800)  Could this finally be the year Spieth takes down his hometown tournament? Spieth accepted invitations to play as an amateur in the Byron Nelson in 2010 and 2011 and finished a respectable 16th and 32nd.
Spieth  ->  positive

On top of this all Harman finished T5 at this event at Bethpage Black in 2012 and impressed again four years later, finishing T22 at the same course and event. With the Bethpage Black form behind him and some solid current form, Harman looks good value this week. Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me.
Harman  ->  positive

He's a bigger price than Tiger and that doesn't make much sense to me. I really like the Glen Abbey angle in so I've played Jhonattan Vegas and last year's runner-up Charley Hoffman and I was quite surprised to be able to back Harris English at a triple-figure price. His form figures here read 43-73-2-31-14 and he caught the eye last week when a fast finishing 11th.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

Let's ride the hot hand. Wesley Bryan ($7,300): Looking for golfers that can go lights out with the putter, Bryan is near the top of that list. Last year alone he had events where he gained 4 or more strokes putting on the week.
Wesley Bryan  ->  positive

At $10,000 he’s expensive but offers a significant discount on the top players and plenty of upside. MY SLEEPER : Martin Flores ($6,700)  Flores is coming into this event off the back of his best finish on the year in Puerto Rico, where he ended up T10 for the week. What I love about Flores this week is the fact he ranks inside the top-10 on Tour in Greens in Regulation and also seems to be putting the ball well as he was ranked T2 in Birdies Made for the week in Puerto Rico.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

Given his current form and his good showing here in 2014, I thought he was overpriced at 150/1. Anirban Lahiri 150/1 (BetVictor & Boylesports) 0.5pt e/w:  Anirban Lahiri is an exceptional talent and he looks ready to make the next step in his career. Whilst Lahiri has seven professional wins, they have either come on the Asia Tour or events co-sanctioned by both the European and Asian Tour.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

He’s fired just one round in the 60’s since April, and the price is too high to risk for a guy who can’t seem to find a top-10. Scott has averaged 58% of his fairways this year, ranking back at 126th which will not suit this golf course. We’d much rather roll with the safer Molinari or pay up for Fowler.
Scott  ->  positive

Glen Abbey, home of the Canadian Open for the last three years provides far and away the strongest course correlation. Last year's winner, Jon Rahm, was runner-up in the Canadian Open in 2016, Jhonattan Vegas, who's won the last two editions of the Canadian Open, finished third here on debut in 2011, Farmers winners, Jason Day and Bubba Watson finished one and two in Canada in 2015, and recent Glen Abbey winners, Brandt Snedeker and Tiger Woods are multiple Torrey Pines winners. I recognise that one could argue that Woods, Day, Watson, Snedeker and Rahm are just high quality players that can win anywhere but in addition to those five and Vegas of course, it's also worth highlighting that the 2009 winner of the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey, Nathan Green, who was a huge outsider, also finished runner-up at Torrey Pines in 2006 at a massive price.
Jhonattan Vegas,  ->  positive

In terms of recent play, the guys to target in bogey avoidance are Brian Harman, Justin Thomas, Paul Casey, Chad Campbell, Byeong-Hun An, Chez Reavie, Kyle Reifers, Spencer Levin, Patrick Reed, and Geoff Ogilvy. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Jordan Spieth ($11,400)  Spieth sputtered a bit last week at the U.S. Open but came storming back Sunday with a 69 in difficult conditions. Surprisingly, Spieth’s ball-striking was solid, but it was his trusty putter that let him down at Erin Hills.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here. "There’s something about that special place that really gets me motivated to play the best I can," he told the Augusta Chronicle.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title. With a T4 finish on his most recent start here, as well as some decent finishes under his belt this season, I thought Piller was worth a bet at a big price, in the hope he can find a win the top-level, for the first time.
Piller  ->  positive

He’s clearly the best value amoung the top three players on DK and the stud worth owning to me. Paul Casey ($10,200): I feel like I am beating the drum week after week here with Casey but he really has been excellent over his past few starts. Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings.
Casey  ->  positive

I’ll take you through some viable cash options as we open up the season:  Russell Henley, 7800: Henley hasn’t played here since 2015 and that included a T3 showing, but had been playing well towards the end of last season with a third place finish at the Tour Championship. Henley sits fifth in SG Approach and tenth in DK points in his last eight rounds at Kapalau. Look for Henley to continue to build on last year.
Henley,  ->  positive

This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open. When the disappointment fades, and it will quickly, Fowler should be thrilled to have been in contention again. We know he likes this track, having chased down Henrik Stenson to win here last year.
Fowler  ->  positive

That is a recipe that should lead to DFS success this week. Also Consider: Patrick Reed  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Billy Horschel  World Golf Ranking (#72)  Vegas Odds (45/1)  Draftkings ($7,900)    After loading the stats this week and seeing Horschel ranked 6th in SG: OTT + APP and Top 10 in Good Drive %, GIR from 200+, and Par 4 Scoring, I was sure he would be in the mid $8K - $9K range. I was delighted when salaries were released to seem him just under $8K.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Other Options: Matt Kuchar (Cash), Charley Hoffman (GPP)  Mid-Tier Targets:  JB Holmes (DK: $8,500, FD: $8,600)    JB is a much better value on DraftKings, but this a course that should suit him perfectly. Holmes is one of the biggest bombers in golf and has a great short game, as well. He should easily be able to take full advantage of the Par 5s.
Holmes  ->  positive

Going With The Grain  Driving Accuracy  Strokes Gained: Approach  Greens in Regulation  Par 3 Birdie or Better  Jordan Spieth ($12,000) and Matt Kuchar ($9,300) will forever be linked thanks to Sunday of The Open Championship this year. It’s hard to argue against Spieth from a recent form standpoint, with two victories in his last two starts. The course fit might give some people pause with his lack of distance, but a third place finish last year and 10th in 2015 should quell those concerns.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

TPC River Highlands plays a whopping 1,000 yards shorter than Erin Hills, though the winning scores here recently have been close to the 16-under we saw last week in Wisconsin. As this is a par-70 track, it's safe to call this week a birdie-fest.The tournament gets quite a boost this year in the form of Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, in their Cromwell debuts, plus Jason Day. After those three there are Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed, but for the most part the field drops off precipitously, with only eight of the OWGR Top 30 on hand.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

We know the green jacket isn’t won with stats but this is a profile worthy of one of the best players on Tour and I’m going to continue to keep him onside in majors while he is priced alongside those who simply aren’t as suited to championship courses. Steele is a streaky putter who is usually better on consistently fast surfaces so if he putts well there is no reason he can’t contend. But one of my favourite bets of the week is for him to make the top 20 and hopefully if he can’t stay on the leaderboard that bet will pay for the more speculative win and each way bets.
Steele  ->  positive

The Argentine enters this year playing his best golf in a while. Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill.
Justin Rose,  ->  positive

He is sixth on Tour in greens in regulation and 47th in both SG: Tee-to-Green and approach. Matt Jones - $6,700 (80-1)    Jones is a curious guy. For a golfer costing $6,700, he has odds of only 80-1.
Jones  ->  positive

Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Ryan Palmer, Jimmy Walker, Mark Wilson. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Keegan Bradley, Wesley Bryan, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, James Hahn, Mac Hughes, Jerry Kelly, Kevin Kisner, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Cameron Smith, Robert Streb, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Michael Thompson, Gary Woodland. There's no doubt that players who've played at Kapalua the week before the Sony Open have historically had an advantage.
Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

This is also very much his time of year. Poulter has won eight times from October to December versus just two titles across the preceding three months and while that's in part due to field strength, it's also a reflection of the fact he so often has had more to play for than others as the campaign draws to a close. At 54th in the world rankings that's very much the case once more and Poulter will know that gaining access to next year's majors and World Golf Championships is his best route back into the Ryder Cup side.
Poulter  ->  positive

The Georgia native won earlier in the season and has found some decent form recently too, including a T5 in his last start at the Greenbrier. What is most impressive about Henley’s record this year might be his performance in the years first two majors as he recorded his best ever finish at Augusta with a T11 and was in contention at the U.S. Open until a subpar final round. While he doesn’t have an extensive Open record, Henley has tended to play well on wind-exposed courses before (he has wins in Hawaii and Florida) and did record a top-20 finish at the Open back in 2015 at the Old-Course.
Henley’s  ->  positive

It is tough to see Hughes wining twice in his first full season on Tour but I think he represents good value at 225/1, as he has proved he is suited to these sort of courses already this season. Luke Donald to finish in the top-10 7/1 (BetVictor) 2pts  Donald was 200/1 to win last week at the Genesis Open, so despite his good week I am not that inclined to take him at 70/1 this week. It is important to remember that Donald has not won anywhere since 2013 (Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan) and not won in America since the Transitions Championship (now Valspar Championship) in 2012.
Luke Donald  ->  positive

#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
Si Woo Kim  ->  positive

Back Brendan Steele 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [10.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [5.0]    Next another chance for one of my US Open picks. Steele earned this column a profit at Erin Hills by hitting the lay target when briefly contending during the third round before falling back to 13th. His accurate long game is ideal for championship courses so I expect he may punch above his weight again in majors.
Steele  ->  positive

The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
Rory McIlroy.  ->  positive

Granted, the latter was not what he was aiming for at the start of the week but a rain-softened course didn't play into his hands and I expect a pretty dramatic improvement for this ease in grade and more obviously suitable layout. Spieth hasn't hit the heights of 2015 and may never again, but he's still won four times in fewer than 40 events since that season ended, confirming that odds of 10/1 are at worst a good representation of his chances. And unlike McIlroy, whose focus is majors, WGCs and the FedEx Cup, Spieth continues to collect regulation PGA Tour titles.
Spieth  ->  positive

His all-around game has been impressive this year, as he’s currently 10th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green. Glover is gaining most of his strokes on approach and should fit this course well. Combine his course fit with the fact that he’s made 6-of-7 cuts, and he should be in plenty of lineups this weekend.
Glover  ->  positive

With the wind set to blow this week I am looking to stick with players who are proven in the wind or/and are renowned ‘ball strikers’ and Knox certainly ticks those boxes. Knox’s renowned ball striking strengths had dipped over the 2016/17 period but his 2018 stats show that he is back on track as he currently lies 38th in Driving Accuracy and 6th in GIR. All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.
Russell  ->  positive

Let's ride the hot hand. Wesley Bryan ($7,300): Looking for golfers that can go lights out with the putter, Bryan is near the top of that list. Last year alone he had events where he gained 4 or more strokes putting on the week.
Bryan  ->  positive

What's more, playing team golf certainly seemed to perk him up and it needed to, as he's fallen to 11th on the Presidents Cup points list and while likely to be named as a wildcard anyway, he won't want to leave things to chance. With all that I've said about the absence of real clues here, I would rather chance Reed's proven ability to get the job done over someone like Paul Casey, who is less than half the price but is nowhere near as ruthless.

Thomas  ->  positive

Given his game has continued to improve and he still made the cut, Steele at $8900 is a very attractive price. Kevin Streelman, $7700 – Streelman has been well known to struggle on the putting green, but if the recent winners have shown, putting can be negligible on this track. His last 24 rounds have seen Streelman be 14th in SG: T2G, 15th in SG: OTT and 24th in Par 5 scoring.
Streelman,  ->  positive

MY PICK : Alex Noren ($8,700)  Noren doesn’t necessarily have the easiest opening group (Tony Finau, Thomas Pieters, Kevin Na), but the Swede has been one of the world’s best players over the past few months and owns the experience angle over his competitors. Noren has an underrated match-play record, having reached the semifinal of the Paul Laurie Match Play event in Europe in 2016 — winning five matches in a row to achieve that feat. He went 3-0 in his Austin pod last year and gave eventual winner Dustin Johnson a good run before losing out to him.
Noren  ->  positive

The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
Scott  ->  positive

It doesn’t hurt that Rahm recently won the Farmers Insurance Open on a course with Kikuyu grass in the fairways and rough and Poa annua greens like the ones at Chapultepec this week. Sergio Garcia ($8,500): Garcia has been very good at the elevation of Crans-sur Sierre: He won the event in 2005 and has finished third, fourth, and sixth in five starts at that track. Garcia’s 67.8 Recent Adj Rd Score is tied for fourth, his 72.6 percent Recent GIR is 15th, and his 16.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for 11th in this week’s field.
Sergio Garcia  ->  positive

Kisner's obvious advantage here is that he's cracked the top five in the last two years while Harman has yet to manage a top 10 in six visits even if his last three are all top 20s. This venue should suit both men much more than the Plantation Course where Kisner finished in midfield (T17). Kisner, notably, finished top of the Strokes Gained: Putting stats (6.303 over the week) in the Sentry TOC and is a big fan of putting on Bermuda greens so he should again relish this test.
Kisner  ->  positive

If you're looking for a longshot, here's your guy. Pinterest Richard Sellers - PA Images  Expert's Picks  Justin Rose  Marc Leishman  Jordan Spieth  Thomas Pieters  Justin Thomas  Rickie Fowler  Tommy Fleetwood  Rory McIlroy  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Expert's Explanation: Don't sweat the change in caddie ; Rory will be fine. For all the fuss made about his Royal Birkdale roller coaster, man still finished T-4.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson ($9,900)  Lefty has been in red-hot form the last two weeks, finishing T-5 two weeks ago at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, and then T-2 last week at Pebble Beach. Mickelson has won twice on this course, back-to-back in 2008 and 2009, and also lost in a playoff in 2012. Born in San Diego, look for a pretty large hometown following for Phil this week, a following that has a good chance of seeing their favorite player in contention on Sunday.
Phil  ->  positive

Baddeley ranked fifth for Scrambling on the PGA Tour last year and he finished fourth at the Australian Open last time out and Taylor finished eighth and fourth here, in 2005 and 2006, on his only two previous appearances. Selections:  Fabian Gomez @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [150.0]  Vaughn Taylor @ [220.0]    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Baddeley  ->  positive

Berger is slightly positive in that regard while Kisner shows a slight dip in the wind. I won't miss Perez later in the year, so Pat Perez will be my pick. They didn't pop in the history + baseline method but golfers like Austin Cook, Cameron Smith, and Marc Leishman all pop in the recent form and course fit department.
Perez  ->  positive

However; he is playing some really solid golf lately and starting to figure out his new putting style. If you are into Narrative Street; Bradley just got married recently but I am more convinced that his resurgence is due to his efforts being redoubled and him finally getting the stigma of that major off his back. Keegan is a solid tee to green player with great distance and very accurate, solid irons and approach game make him a viable candidate to show well here at the Waste Management.
Bradley  ->  positive

Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

@ 100/1  There's also been some mileage down the years in picking players who finished nicely at Augusta National without feeling the heat of contention. One who fits the bill here is Si Woo Kim, whose weekend score of five-under was just one more swish than winner Patrick Reed took over the final 36 holes at Augusta National. Kim eventually finished tied 24th.
Kim,  ->  positive

Spieth is currently 20th in Good Drive Percentage and performs well in Par 4 and Par 5 Scoring for the distances that TPC River Highlands features. Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes.
Casey  ->  positive

Putting is clearly of lesser importance here, as the greens are flat and allow even shaky putters to look graceful with the flat stick -- think Hideki Matsuyama, Kevin Stadler, and two-time runner-up Bubba Watson. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12500 – Spieth’s unparalleled putting gets the headlines, but last year he was second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, a major ingredient to success at TPC Scottsdale. Spieth is obviously great at all aspects of the game and can win anywhere, but his combination of smarts and talent should net him his third top-10 finish in as many starts in Scottsdale this week.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot. Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10
Chappell  ->  positive

Thomas can win anywhere and leads the PGA Tour in birdie-or-better percentage. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Marc Leishman, $8500 – A winner at Bay Hill in March, Leishman has put up nothing but solid efforts his last five events, finishing no worse than 34th. He’s also 21st in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green and averages just shy of 4 birdies per round.
Marc Leishman,  ->  positive

J.T. Poston  In a surprisingly deep field, the rookie Poston arrives at TPC Four Seasons at Las Colinas with seven straight made cuts and the 28th-highest Recent Adjusted Round (Adj Rd) Score at 68.9. Over the last year, Poston has exceeded his DraftKings salary expectations with an +11.7 Plus/Minus, averaging 61.6 points per tournament.
Poston  ->  positive

He is ranked 44th in driving accuracy. Stewart Cink - $6,800 (150-1)  Cink is in the odd position of going 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National but never securing a top-25 (he was T27 and T26 the past two years). So, if you are looking for a bargain-basement price with a really good chance to make the cut, Cink is your man.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation.
Stenson:  ->  positive

Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

I like places like that." Stats-wise this season, he's 9th for Driving Accuracy, 4th for Greens In Regulation, 11th for Scrambling and 8th for Strokes Gained: Putting so take out big hitting - something that isn't crucial on PGA National's Champions Course this week - and Harman is doing everything right. Oh, it's a par 70 as well so his third place in Par 4 Scoring Average adds to the mix.
Harman  ->  positive

The sensitivity to shotmaking, chipping, putting on Tour‑caliber greens and rough and things that you can’t replicate at your home course is getting sharper because I did play these last two weeks.”  This all makes very good reading as he heads into an event he loves so dearly and I really do believe this is where we could see Mickelson get back to winning ways. Brendan Steele 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Steele has enjoyed a hot start to 2016, and continued that last week with a T20 finish at the Farmers Insurance Open. In six starts this season, Steele has one win and two 6th place finishes.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

For the shorter course manager type players, we’d like them to have Par 5 Scoring ability, as most in the Top 10, score half their final tallies on the Par 5’s. For players that have played these courses over the last 8 years, and at least twice, these players play it the best: Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Dustin Johnson, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Jason Day, Tim Clark, Pat Perez, Nick Watney, Jordan Spieth, Retief Goosen, Chesson Hedley, Brandt Snedeker, JB Holmes, Graeme Mcdowell, Mike Weir, Spencer Levin and Patrick Reed. So what do these guys have in common for the most part?
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Outside of Adam Scott (4th in each of the first 3 playoff events), no player has been better on tour. This wouldn’t quite be a Billy Horschel story of coming out of nowhere to win, but Casey would be a surprise winner, and makes for a good 2nd golfer in lineups this week. Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes.
Casey  ->  positive

Last week's performance in Puerto Rico was a little disappointing in some respects, given that he'd put together successive top-25 finishes in much deeper fields previously, but it looks like Lee just didn't get anything going on the greens and it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. On his last start in this event, Lee missed the cut but a second-round 66 contained eight birdies and just one mistake, a costly double-bogey. Just two players in the field bettered his Friday score and he was very close to undoing the damage of round one.
Lee  ->  positive

Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 2ew Thomas 18-1, Fowler 18-1; 1ew Kisner 40-1
Kisner  ->  positive

Here are a few names to consider at every different price level. High-Priced  Hideki Matsuyama ($11,700) – It’s not that I don’t like Spieth – it’s that I couldn’t justify putting anyone higher on this list than Matsuyama. He has been as hot as anyone in golf since last fall, consistently playing well enough to make cuts and at least getting into position to challenge for a top spot on the leaderboard week in and week out.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Matt Kuchar ($9,400) – Steady Kuchar looked like a potential cut risk on Thursday/Friday last week, but in typical Kuchar fashion, he rallied back for a nice and easy T12 finish. There is nobody in this field with a better overall track record at this course, and when it comes to smooth, steady T2G play, Kuchar is among the best ever. Lock him in.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

So far this year there’s been little to recommend the 26-year-old with finishes of T41-MC but he opened the CareerBuilder Challenge with rounds of 67-64 so there are glimmers of form. Danny Lee also has form at TPC Scottsdale, he was leading going into the final round last year but a horrible final 18 holes where his putting fell apart lost him the tournament. I’m sure one of his early season targets is to redeem himself at TPC Scottsdale and he arrives under the radar.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

He owns a runner-up finish at TPC Boston and enjoys putting on bentgrass. Tony Finau ($6,500): Sticking with the theme from above, Finau also loves putting on bentgrass and saves us some salary. Rory McIlroy ($11,100) : He's still one of the best at racking up birdies (and eagles) in bunches when he's on his game.
Finau  ->  positive

I've been slow to jump on the train, but I can't ignore the form plus local knowledge angle. Austin Cook ($8,300): Going with my second rookie, Cook certainly doesn't play like a rookie. He's beat the field average by four or more strokes in five of his seven starts this season.
Austin Cook  ->  positive

Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings. Given the potentially high winds I do think this is a field in which you can potentially fade the top three options and still field a winning gpp roster and Casey might be the man to target if you are going after that strategy. Marc Leishman ($9,300): After a brief hiatus after the Masters to rest a sore back, Leishman looked on point last week at the Byron Nelson with a strong T13 finish, where he ranked second in the field in SG: Tee to Green and third in approaches.
Casey  ->  positive

Take the 16/1. I'll go for the great mates angle again by making Harris English and Hudson Swafford my next picks at 50/1. These two are both Georgia Bulldogs, huge friends off the course (English flew in late to the 2014 Sony Open after attending Swafford's wedding) and even get mistaken for each other due to certain similarities in appearance.
English  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Knox.  ->  positive

“I think my game shapes up well to the challenge as I am fairly precise off the tee, have a good short game and good feel with the putter.”  All ideal credentials for Erin Hills - credentials which are vastly improved from 12 months ago when he finished an excellent T23 and was leading amateur medallist for the week at Oakmont. The odd sign of frustration can still bubble to the surface and this is definitely not the place to lose your rag, but Rahm has a wonderfully affable, laid-back personality and it is not difficult to see him taking that next step up the ladder even though it might be a pretty sizeable one. An 82 at the PLAYERS and a missed cut in The Memorial might not be too much of a setback looking at the bigger picture as he still managed to sandwich a T2 at Colonial in between before turning his attentions to this week.
Rahm  ->  positive

Team #rahmGOAT is back in action this weekend. Adam Scott ($9,800) – Love the way Scott has been playing lately. He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year.
Scott  ->  positive

Dave Tindall previews the first PGA Tour event of the calendar year - the Sentry Tournament of Champions at Kapalua Resort in Hawaii...  "Two years ago Fowler fired 69-67-69-67 for a top five. It means he's 26-under for his last five rounds at Kapalua." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 5 places  Main Bet: Back Rickie Fowler e.w.
Fowler  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7400): The third golfer this week is also a mid-priced option, which leaves lots of wiggle room to squeeze in an elite golfer without blowing over the salary cap; the 29-year old Stanley has had his coming-out party this year, sitting 38th in FedEx Cup points and three top-10s including a T4 at the PLAYERS. Going back to the fall swing season, Stanley has only missed two cuts (Honda and OHL Classic), and has been one of the best on Tour in terms of tee-to-green (5th) and Bogey Avoidance (12th). Where Stanley has struggled immensely is with the flatstick in hand, ranking 165th in SG: Putting, but he’s elite in almost every other factor on the way to the green.
Stanley  ->  positive

Jon Rahm  ->  positive

At a venue where you're meant to have five or six tries before fathoming things out, Spieth has Masters form of 2-1-2-11. After a rather mixed season so far, Spieth went into the Houston Open trying to give himself the perfect springboard for another Green Jacket assault. He did just that with rounds of 68-67-71-66 to finish third.
Spieth  ->  positive

RESULT: T21  Phil Mickelson 1.5pts EW 35/1 with Get up to £50 in free bets via this link:  Phil Mickelson is another who I think is well suited to TPC Boston and circumstances are ripe for a Lefty victory in these FedEx Cup Playoffs after a magnificent season. Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Fortunately Dominic had done enough by then to wrap up his card for 2018 and he returned to the tour in January at Hawaii. Understandably after 5 months off it was a slow start to the year for Bozzelli however he turned in his best performance of the season so far at last weeks Genesis Open with a 26th place finish. Dominic’s stats for the week in LA were promising in that he finished 21st in DA and 27th in GIR with the putter holding him back.
Bozzelli  ->  positive

Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance. While not all his stats are strong this year he does rank 1st in strokes gained: putting and 4th in par 4 scoring and I’m sure his whole 2018 campaign so far will have been geared to peaking this week.
Day  ->  positive

Chesson Hadley  Hadley finished just one stroke out of the playoffs due to a bogey on the final hole. Still, a T4 finish is excellent for the price tag Hadley had on both DraftKings & FanDuel as he finished with the 3rd most fantasy points in both formats. Course Preview  The PGA Tour says goodbye to Las Vegas and is heading to Playa Del Carmen in Mexico.
Hadley  ->  positive

He hit the front during the opening round at the WGC-Mexico Championship last time out, when he raced to seven-under-par through 11 holes, before a bizarre finish saw him sit tied for 13th after 18 and in his previous three starts he finished the first day within three of the lead so he's been starting fast of late. Paul Krishnamurty says: Back Francesco Molinari @ 50/1  On the European Tour, especially in events where he already boasted a good record, Francesco Molinari has often started brilliantly to claim the first round lead - he also led at last year's Wells Fargo. Having finished no worse than 17th in the last four Bay Hill renewals, three of which yielded top-nines, there's every reason to believe he can do so again.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

Johnson finished 14th here in 2014 after the changes were made to the greens and before that had finished 6th in 2011 and 11th in 2009. The changes made this week don’t play into Johnson’s hands, with the course being lengthened but as we know Johnsons is capable of winning and contending at courses that appear too long for him. With wins at Augusta and St. Andrews as well as contending last week at the 7,400 yard Firestone, it would be naïve to rule Johnson out based on the length of the course.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

I felt it was important to play rather than week on, week off, and just kind of get some momentum going." He certainly has that momentum now after his top five and Rose's past experiences at Bay Hill suggest another bold bid. This is a venue where past course form seems to count for more than average and Rose has a second in 2013, a third in 2011, an eighth in 2006 and, most recently, T13 (2017) and T9 (2016) the last two years.
Rose's  ->  positive

David Lingmerth - $14,200    The 30-year-old hasn’t played since a T17 at the RSM Classic as he took time off after becoming a father in December, but he’ll be back in action this week at the CareerBuilder Challenge where he’s finished runner-up twice in five starts. Lingmerth’s advantage will be the putter, having ranked sixth on Tour in one-putt percentage and 11th in putting from inside 10 feet last season. Bargain Bin    Brian Stuard - $14,000    Stuard impressed at the Sony Open with four consecutive rounds of 67 or less en route to his T4 finish, while he also led the field in driving accuracy and ranked second in SG: Putting.
David Lingmerth  ->  positive

He looks like a player that could really suit this course and has to be respected here. Patrick Reed 33/1  Despite starting the season poorly, Reed has been showing some good signs over the last few weeks with some solid performances. He finished solo 10th at the Hero World Challenge and followed that with a T6 at the SBS Tournament of Champions, which included a second round 65.
Reed  ->  positive

Although has not necessarily excelled this year a T25 finish at the WGC – Mexico Championship was a step in the right direction for Molinari. Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced.
Molinari.  ->  positive

Leishman is playing well and was seventh last week. Tony Finau ($11,000 | 33) - Finau didn't play last week at Kapalua but does have strong recent form, reeling off six straight top-26 finishes. He grades out 6th in tee-to-green play over the past 12 events, as well as 7th in par 5 scoring, 10th in birdie or better rate, and 2nd in driving distance.
Finau  ->  positive

What we have to hope is his putter gets hot, and perhaps his success on these greens in the past will carry him to the top of the leaderboard this weekend. Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick.
Scott  ->  positive

Ranks third in total driving, second in greens hit, third in proximity to the hole, fifth in strokes gained: tee-to-green and 11th in adjusted scoring. Harris English ... The career arc is a funny thing regardless of pedigree.
Harris English  ->  positive

Keep your eye on him for “weekend golf” at DraftKings, where bogeys are much less disastrous. Even with his Recent Bogey Score, Cauley is a top-five golfer in the CSURAM88 Player Model. Patrick Reed  Reed has missed the cut in three of his last five tournaments and in his only two appearances at The Byron Nelson, so he’s probably terrifying for people who focus on recent form and course history.
Cauley  ->  positive

Reed is still struggling a bit with his irons, but his scrambling is elite, and he’s making as many birdies as anyone on Tour. Reed has two top-30s at this course in three attempts, but he’s the firm favorite for me this week. Bill Haas ($10,800)  Haas is another player trending towards a win this summer.
Reed  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done. In Europe, Danny Willett defends the European Masters at the stunning Crans-Sur-Sierre in Switzerland.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

he ranks #1 on my model because of the elite form and ranks behind only DJ in my stats model. Looking at the salary gap on DraftKings between the two, I will take the discount with Rahm as new courses have not even come close to stopping this kids momentum early in his career. Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#34)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,300)    Believe it or not, Molinari actually comes in a tick higher than DJ in the form ranks this week.

Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1.
Jason Day.  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
Scott  ->  positive

Over five starts at Hilton Head since 2011, he has three top-10s, including a T4 from 2016. DFS STRATEGY  Cash Games — Of the top-four golfers this week, the one who seems best suited for this format is Matt Kuchar ($10,800). It was mentioned above, but Kuchar has not missed a cut at Hilton Head since before 2004.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

One of those missed cuts came in the season-opener, the Safeway Open in October and the other at the RSM Classic in November. It is really since the turn of the new year that Harman has looked in great shape. In 2017, Harman has two top-24 finishes, taking his top-25 tally to three for the season (finished T15 at the Shriners in Vegas).
Harman  ->  positive

Past Champions    2017 – Justin Thomas  2016 – Fabian Gomez  2015 – Jimmy Walker  2014 – Jimmy Walker  2013 – Russell Henley  2012 – Johnson Wagner  2011 – Mark Wilson  2010 – Ryan Palmer  2009 – Zach Johnson  2008 – K.J. Choi    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth, $19,800    It’s clear Spieth and Justin Thomas are the cream of this week’s crop, but Spieth comes with a higher salary due to his strong finish last week at Kapalua. Spieth possesses all the course management and iron game necessary to slay this course, and with a third-place effort last season, he’ll be hungry for more this time around.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Ryan Moore EW @ 40/1  It's been said before that Copperhead also has plenty of nods towards courses in the Carolinas. So it's perhaps no coincidence that, just like Stenson, Ryan Moore is a former winner of the Wyndham Championship and has some excellent form here. Moore has been a regular visitor since coming on tour and as well as an early T8 in 2007 and a top 20 in 2009, he's been one of the best performers in this event over the last three years with finishes of 18-3-5.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

RESULT: T17  Hideki Matsuyama 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (5 places EW, 1/4 odds):  It's been a fascinating spell at the top of world golf in recent times with the elite players each seemingly taking it in turns to show what they can do before handing the baton to one of their peers. As the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy have all reached the world number 1 spot before hitting the buffers over the past few years, Hideki Matsuyama has been steadily creeping up on them all with some scintillating golf at times. Having hit a career-high of 2nd in the OWGR after finishing runner-up to Koepka at the US Open, the 25 year-old is going to need to win a Major or two if he's going to find his way to the very top of the pile in this current climate, however that's certainly not out of the realms of possibility.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

As well, there are lots of boom/bust players at Sawgrass: Rickie Fowler has a win and a 2nd to his name, with multiple missed cuts, Kevin Na has three top-10s but three missed cuts, and the list goes on. The Golfers  The Core  Justin Thomas ($8900): Although he’s only played the track twice, JT calls the PLAYERS his favorite event on Tour (non-major), and has the short course history to show for it with a top-25 his first time out followed by a T3 last year. On courses where he doesn’t have the opportunity to spray his driver all over the course (54.68% Driving Accuracy), Thomas is always an immediate consideration given how strong the rest of his game plays.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

He’s my somewhat dark horse pick to win this week. MY SLEEPER : Emiliano Grillo ($6,900)  Grillo has had a tough year, punctuated by a stretch of four missed cuts in five starts to end the regular season. Grillo’s tee to green game hasn’t been that bad, however, and he bounced back nicely last week with a T29 at Glen Oaks — where he ranked T3 in Greens in Regulation and gained over 5.8 strokes on the field in his approaches.
Grillo  ->  positive

Last year’s winner Dustin Johnson led the year long stats in that range in 2016 and 2015 runner-up Bubba Watson was also very strong in that area when he won. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($10,600): Fowler has played remarkably well ever since February and is probably a tad unlucky he only has one win to his credit thus far. That could easily change at Firestone however, a course where Rickie has finished inside the top ten on four out of seven visits.
Fowler  ->  positive

I will be using Dufner in both cash and gpp formats at this price point. Adam Hadwin ($8,400) – Another mid-range player you can use to pay up for other golfers, Hadwin also comes in with great form and solid course history. Hadwin is 2/2 at Dean and Deluca Invitational with a 22nd and 5th.
Hadwin  ->  positive

However, for one reason or another, they have not made much noise on Tour of late and have seen their prices drop as a result. It was only a year ago that Day finished Top-10 in three majors and Stenson won his first major, and it has only been a matter of months since Thomas and Matsuyama were seemingly taking turns winning every other week. The pick in this group will be, who ranks in the Top 15 in all three categories mentioned in the opener and already owns three victories this season.Brooks Koepka – $15,700Francesco Molinari – $15,000Tyrrell Hatton – $14,100Bill Haas – $13,300The Pick: This is the widest range of players among this week’s groupings, but all these players are capable of filling out the middle of your lineup depending on what you do at the top or bottom.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

The credentials are strong but I think the 20/1 presumes Cauley will flourish again and I'm not so sure he can. Instead, I'll head back to the 50/1 shots and take Russell Henley and Blayne Barber. Looking back, these two were teammates on the 2011 US Palmer Cup squad.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Bozzelli made the cut at the Sony Open last week, shooting three rounds of 68 or better and he finished fifth at this event last year. Dominic Bozzelli ($6,800): The 216 golfers who have played this tournament with a DraftKings salary of $6,900 or less have averaged 63.19 PPT with a +15.64 Plus/Minus and 73.1 percent Consistency. Despite his recent course history and affordable salary, Hadwin appears to be flying under the radar this week.
Dominic Bozzelli  ->  positive

• • •  Adam Schupak  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. The player who most reminds me of Long John Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA at Crooked Stick, is my pick. He’s coming off T-18 and T-8 in the first two legs of the FedEx Cup and will be able to bomb and gouge it this week to his third title of the season.
Dustin Johnson.  ->  positive

(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Marc Leishman is a Torrey Pines specialist who as we know is in cracking form right now. Talk of coastal golf, Kikuyugrass fairways and tough, technical scoring conditions on the South Course shouts Leishman from the rooftops and he certainly has the tools at his disposal to make a serious challenge this week, with no attention on him whatsoever. A tournament average score of 70.75 is only beaten by Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker and Charles Howell III amongst tournament regulars.
Leishman  ->  positive

Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

But his price has been cut and I don’t think I can back him at just 12/1 on a course that he hasn’t seen before. Instead I will include him in a small each way double with Francesco Molinari. Summary of Bets  Shriners Open  Francesco Molinari – 1pt ew @ 30/1  John Huh – 0.5pt ew @ 150/1  Colt Knost – 0.25pt ew @ 300/1  Turkish Open  Matthew Southgate – 0.5pt ew @ 66/1  Benjamin Hebert – 0.5pt ew @ 100/1  Fabrizio Zanotti – 0.5pt ew @ 66/1  0.25 ew double @ 402/1 – Molinari + Sullivan  Weekly points advised – 7pts  Total pts advised – 840pts  @theGreek82  Advertisements

I care more about winning now and less about just making cuts or trying to establish myself. I feel like I've been out here long enough to show that I'm a decent player, Saunders told golf.com. Since shooting a 59 at October's Web.com Championship (in Florida) and securing his PGA Tour card, the 30-year-old has started 2018 with a top 25 at the Sony Open and T8 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Saunders  ->  positive

As long as he can steer clear of Rae’s Creek and any lingering demons from last year’s collapse, Spieth will make an excellent play in guaranteed prize pools this year, even as one of the highest-salaried golfers in the field. With his history at Augusta and current form, Spieth seems poised to make another run at a green jacket this year. He is off to a great start this year and is poised to eclipse the massive numbers he posted in the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.
Spieth  ->  positive

Aaron Wise - $12,100    It would be wise to throw a couple lower-priced darts into your lineups this week in order to stack a few of the weapons at the top. Wise, a rookie out of the University of Oregon, has experience not only winning on the Web.com Tour, but also finished top-35 at last year’s CareerBuilder and owns a pair of top-25s this season. The 21-year-old ranks 42nd on Tour in SG: Putting and 54th in SG: Off-the-Tee.
Aaron Wise  ->  positive

A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag.
McGirt  ->  positive

Horschel was fourth there in the spring and eighth, alongside McGirt, in 2016. Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here. While Horschel closed with a bogey at Colonial, Emiliano Grillo finished birdie-birdie for 24th and some momentum ahead of his return to this event.
Horschel  ->  positive

Honda update Knox 45 Berger 50 Ollie 55 Grillo 80 Wiesberger 80 Horschel 100
Berger  ->  positive

Wagner makes for a strong cash play with GPP upside this week as he has made four of five cuts, including a win in 2011. Jeff Bergerson -- Ryan Blaum ($6,900)  One of the quieter rookies so far on the Tour, Blaum has nevertheless established himself as a player to be on the lookout for during the rest of the season. Blaum has made the cut in all three events this season and finished no lower than 31st.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price. Finally, I want to side with Kevin Na in some way and the top-five and top-10 markets look best. In essence, Na is another accurate type, with form at altitude and at some of the PGA Tour’s tighter courses, such as Harbour Town and Silverado.
Na  ->  positive

Many believe the elevation of the course this week will have it play similar to Crans-sur-Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters, which Noren has won twice including last year. Noren has three top 25 finishes in four starts so far this season but could add some value in your Fantasy team in a strong field this week in Mexico. Those are our picks, now it’s time to make yours.
Noren  ->  positive

Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday. Martin Kaymer – $7,300  Martin Kaymer will be the most popular player this week and he is still a staple for me in cash and GPP lineups.
Scott  ->  positive

Harbour Town should set up quite nicely for his particular skill set, and the price is pretty reasonable for all formats. Luke Donald ($7,800) – Donald’s certainly not a guy we rely on week to week, but at certain spots, he’s just ridiculous – this one of them. Since 2009, Donald has carded four (4) runner-up finishes along with two third-place finishes.
Luke Donald  ->  positive

He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter. Bryan tied for 47th in proximity last year and was 45th in strokes gained putting, with both positions improving as the season went on. With many short par-4s, wedge play will take on added importance this week.
Bryan  ->  positive

His scoring average in 18 competitive rounds here is 67.67. Trey Mullinax … Every rookie should be inspired by Xander Schauffele's victory at The Greenbrier Classic, but Mullinax has a unique connection to the first-time winner in that both were in the conversation on the weekend at the U.S. Open where they posted top 10s to earn exemptions into the 2018 edition. Mullinax's path began the week prior when he finished T18 at the FedEx St. Jude Classic, but his arc since includes a measurable improvement with his approach game.
Mullinax  ->  positive

If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
Justin Thomas.  ->  negative

Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required. An undoubted talent, Na might not trouble the winner's interviewer nearly enough, but at 64th in the OWGR and 40th in the FedEx Cup series, the Las Vegas man will be gunning for a top 5 finish this week to grab a coveted East Lake spot. He has previous with this back in 2015 when he travelled to Chicago in 34th spot in the FEC standings.
Na  ->  positive

You only need to look at another of the players in our team this week, Billy Horschel, for evidence of this. Horschel of course memorably chunked a ball in to the water when he had the Deutsche Bank Championship in his hands in 2014 only to come back out and win the BMW Championship the following week. Another memorable example was Kyle Stanley who gifted away the Farmers Insurance event at Torrey Pines on the 72nd hole only to win the following week at the Phoenix Open.
Billy Horschel,  ->  positive

Stuard’s only Tour win came at the 2016 Zurich Classic, which was shortened to 54-holes due to heavy rainfall. Whilst this is a win as much as any other, Stuard will be keen to prove himself a winner over four rounds and with the start he has made to this season, this may well be the year. This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open.
Stuard  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

Patton Kizzire, who won the aforementioned OHL Classic nicely in November missed the cut on debut 12 months ago and he didn't put brilliantly last week when finishing 15th but I thought [85.0] was juicy enough for him. And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average.
Chris Stroud,  ->  positive

At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago). Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

My one major concern is that he has never won a PGA Tour event (excluding Open Championship) but he has contended at the Masters,in WGC’s and here, so he is clearly capable of doing so. Sean O’Hair 110/1 (Bet365)  Last week Sean O’Hair finished 2nd at The Barclays, which was only his second top-10 of the season. This doesn’t tell the whole story though and 2016 has been another decent chapter in a fight back in his career.
Sean  ->  positive

He also has the pressure of attempting to become the youngest ever player to win the career grand slam following his Open Championship success last month. It would be extremely daft to write him off but others are preferred at the prices and the one I really like is last week's winner, Hideki Matsuyama. When Matsuyama hits form he tends to stay in form and with course form figures reading an improving 38-20-11, he looks the most solid of the market leaders.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  positive

Vegas Odds  Since 2014, Spieth has played in about as many tournaments with odds to win of at least 10 percent as he has with odds of less than 10 percent. Unsurprisingly, he has excelled as a double-digit Vegas favorite:  Conversely, Spieth has exceeded his salary-based expectations in just 20 of 39 tournaments when playing with odds to win of less than 10 percent. His PPT drops to 74.92 — nearly 10 points below his average as a favorite — and his Plus/Minus dips by -0.64 points.
Spieth  ->  positive

Casey is only 20/1 this week, but this is a reduced field and he clearly has an affinity with the course, so all in all the price doesn’t look as quite as bad as it may first appear. Justin Rose 20/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Rose has not played since the FedEx Cup play-offs so comes into this week fresh from a run of form that saw him finish inside the top-10 in each of the four FedEx Cup play-off events with a 2nd and three 10th place finishes. There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off.
Rose  ->  positive

He started 2017 with a T17 at the SBS Tournament of Champions in Kapalua and followed that with a T11 at The Sony where he opened with an impressive 64 in round one. Knox has only played here once before which was back in 2015 finishing a respectable T15 on nine under for the tournament. The Scot ranks 37th in SGP, 12th in driving accuracy, 11th in GIR, fourth in par 3 scoring and eighth in par 5 scoring.
Knox  ->  positive

Dave Tindall, who tipped 40/1 US Open winner Brooks Koepka in last week's Each-Way column, looks for more profits in his preview of this week's PGA Tour event in Connecticut...  "Lahiri shot 69-65 on the weekend at Muirfield Village three weeks ago so will be chomping at the bit to get going again." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places      Wesley Bryan, Russell Knox, Jhonattan Vegas, Billy Hurley III, Branden Grace and Davis Love III. What unites them?
"Lahiri  ->  positive

PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.

As far as recent performance goes Woodland has made seven straight cuts dating back to last season. Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th.
Dufner  ->  positive

Away from the obvious favourite the same faces show up time and again and it was a matter of prices that appeal. We were on Harris English last week and he was our best finisher of the week in 8th. That continues his revival after a torrid 2017 when slipping from top-80 in the OWGR to outside the top-250 and after a closing 11th at the CareerBuilder he may well continue some impressive event form.
Harris English  ->  positive

On the European side, Stenson’s played three times and picked up two top-10s (T6 in Dubai, 8th in Abu Dhabi), so his form is fine as he heads into the week looking to gear up for the first major. Other golfers to consider: Russell Henley ($9200) – immaculate course history even if the YTD stats don’t appeal, Charles Howell III ($8900)  Value Golfers (below $8000)  J.B. Holmes ($7300): Another golfer that missed the cut here last year but has strong course history beyond that (prior to 2017 his last MC here was in 2007), Holmes is another longer hitter that can dial it back off the tee to put himself in great spots for second shots. Holmes proved that in his win in 2015, which is the highlight of his history here that also includes a runner-up, T8, T12, and T42.
Holmes  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Racing Post - Steve Palmer - RBC Heritage - 2.5ew Kisner 28/1; 2ew Fitzpatrick 35/1, 2ew Henley 25/1
Kisner  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson ($11,300) – He’s the best in the world, and I dare you to overthink it and fade him. His superior combination of indomitable length, wedge play, putting, and supreme “relaxation” (or whatever you want to call it) on the golf course make him the ultimate grind machine on tough tracks.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs. The defending FedEx Cup Champ, Spieth finished 2nd here as well back in 2013, with a disappointing 27th in 2014 in between. Spieth needs a win and some help to win the FedEx Cup, and while he may have had a “disappointing” season by his standards, it wouldn’t surprise me to see him repeat come Sunday night.
Spieth  ->  positive

Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics. Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts. Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week.
Finau  ->  positive

I'd expect the eventual semi-finalist to come from the bottom half of the quarter though and to that end I'm backing Patrick Reed to be the player to prevail. Opponents Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel have both been off the boil of late - the Chinese star has finished outside of the top-50 on each of his starts since winning in Dubai and the former Masters Champion hasn't managed a top-10 globally since June of last year - which leaves Jordan Spieth as Reed's biggest challenge. Of course Spieth is well capable of finding the putting form that saw him rise to the top of the world rankings back in 2015-2016, however the process changes he's been making with the flat stick are yet to bed in fully and that leaves the door open for an aggressive player like Patrick Reed to take full advantage.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

The Englishman has yet to win on American soil, but this could be the week Fleetwood proves himself worthy of a top-10 spot in the OWGR. Glue Guys    Marc Leishman - $14,800    Leishman crushed it on the par-fives at Bay Hill en route to his victory at the API last year, and although he doesn’t own impeccable recent form as of late, a sub-$15K price tag shouldn’t go unnoticed for the No. 16 ranked player in the OWGR.
Leishman  ->  positive

This week, several golfers with great LT Adj Rd Scores and low salaries are available: Stewart Cink (who looks like the value chalk play this week), Chad Campbell, and Luke List. Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips.
List.  ->  positive

That is solid playing for close to min price on DraftKings. Ryan Blaum ($6,300) is another player with great value this week. He placed 35th in the 2015 ULC and then placed 10th in the 2016 ULC.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

He's been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta. Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn't exactly fit the "bomber" prototype that tends to succeed here, but he didn't play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition's averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance with his driver -- he sits near the top in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes.
Moore  ->  positive

It is still hard at this point to predict the winning score this week, given the series of changes made to the course but he has had the goods here in the past and the majority of the course will be the same as it has been in the past. A 4th here last year suggests the change to Bermuda greens did not bother Fowler, and I struggle to see this week panning out without him involved over the weekend. With Matsuyama, McIlroy and Spieth looking so strong, it is hard for anyone to topple them but Fowler is one player that is certainly capable of doing just that.
Fowler,  ->  positive

If that remains the case this week, he looks a good price to continue his current form in the event. Lowry has struggled to keep bogeys off his card this season, something he will have to improve on this week, however he tends to bounce back from a bad hole fairly often. He currently ranks 11th in the Bounce Back category on the PGA Tour, so he is following up bogeys with birdies or better on a regular basis.
Lowry  ->  positive

Value picks (below $7500):  Smylie Kaufman ($7000) – The LSU product has been having some success recently, with four top-35 finishes in his last six official events, and has better form off the tee than his overall ranking suggests. Kaufman still struggles to find the fairway with the driver, but should easily get there if he clubs down, and he’s above average from the 175-200 range which is a big plus this week. He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently.
Smylie Kaufman  ->  positive

DeChambeau finished 14th at the Mayakoba earlier this season, a bonus bit of optimism this week and if he can build on his performances in Phoenix (5th) and Bay Hill which have both come on his last six starts, he can certainly feature here, in a field where a lot of the top players are absent. Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee.
Cook  ->  positive

Michael Bamberger, senior writer, Sports Illustrated: It’s neat how, at almost every Open venue, the course is the story going in and the players upon it is the story going out. This course is particularly interesting and Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, etc., are compelling players. John Wood, caddie for Matt Kuchar (@Johnwould): I'm anxious to see if different types of golfers can compete on this track.
Spieth,  ->  positive

2017 DraftKings Valspar Tips  This tournament is one where it often gets overlooked, but the course is tough and it takes a week of good ball striking to win here. This week I think Bill Haas is going to come away with the victory. Close here last year, but he often goes under-owned when he shouldn’t.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot. Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts.

Chappell  ->  positive

For Rickie Fowler, it was the scene of his first win on Tour in 2012 while he was T6 on debut in 2010 and also fourth in 2016. The change of greens from Bentgrass to Bermuda should hardly work against Fowler either. His win this season (which helped get him through all the statistical checks) came in Florida and he's a proven performer on Bermuda.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Henley may have only won one match in his group last week at the Match Play, but he proved difficult to beat, losing his matches to Kyle Stanley and Paul Casey by just one hole, whilst taking care of Matthew Fitzpatrick with a 3&2 victory. In four starts at Augusta, Henley has finished MC-31-21-11 so not only does he like this course, he’s also trending in the right direction at the course it warms you up for, so it’s clear he likes the way they both setup. If adverse weather conditions do hit this event this week, that won’t bother Henley one bit, given his exponents in windy conditions (wins in Hawaii and PGA National), so there really doesn’t appear to be many downsides about his chances this week.
Henley  ->  positive

If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open.

Phil Mickelson 28/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson has not won since the 2013 Open Championship and that is an obvious concern, but where better to get back on track than TPC Scottsdale. Mickelson is a three-time winner here and has shot the course record (60) twice, so it is clear he loves the place. Unlike Torrey Pines (where he had struggled in recent years), Mickelson has still kept up his form here.

Prior to the Genesis Open, he'd made six straight cuts on Tour with three top-10 finishes. PGA National has similar attributes (windy, narrow, lots of water hazards, and bermuda greens) to Mayakoba, TPC Southwind, and Harbour Town, all of which are venues where Gay has won. And for those of you who are stat geeks, Gay ranks 18th in total strokes gained against the field over the past 10 weeks.

5. Patrick Cantlay  Ladies and gents, meet the next generation’s Paul Casey. Albeit delayed a few years due to injury, Cantlay burst on the PGA scene in 2018 with all of the composure of a long-time veteran, making the cut in literally every event he played (13/13) with eight top-25 finishes and four top-tens.

Four years later, Moore returned to Bethpage and finished T7 and just three shots shy of winner, Patrick Reed. Not only does Moore have form at Bethpage, he has also shown a liking for Augusta National in the past. Moore played Augusta twice as an amateur, finishing T45 in 2003 before returning in 2005 where he finished T13 and took the Low Amateur honours.
Moore  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes. His play so far this year is good enough to land him within the top-60 in every major statistical category.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

All three courses - Harbour Town, Sea Island and Colonial - represent good form pointers for the Sony Open. Kevin Kisner: Worth backing in Hawaii  Kisner's record here reflects his career trajectory. For years he struggled, and then something clicked as he opened with a round of 63 en route to fifth in 2016, before going one place better after a closing 65 last year.
Kevin Kisner:  ->  positive

Marc Leishman was giving both Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth all they could handle at TPC Boston last Monday, but ultimately - with a 2-shot lead on the 10th tee - the pressure got to him. However from adversity we've seen players blossom and Leishman, who sits 7th in the FedEx Cup standings, has the kind of result CV that links beautifully to previous winners here Zach Johnson and Jason Day. 5th at Waialae in 2014 (Johnson was winner there in 2009), 2nd at Torrey Pines in both 2010 and 2014 (Day was a winner there in 2015), 1st at Bay Hill this year (Day won there in 2016), 4th at Augusta in 2013 (Johnson won there in 2007, Day 2nd in 2011), 3rd at TPC Four Seasons in both 2012 and 2014 (Day won there in 2010), 2nd at St Andrews in 2015 (Johnson won the title, with Day 4th a single shot out of the Playoff), plus 3rd at Firestone in 2014 (Johnson was 2nd there this year), highlight that Leishman can circulate in very high echelons when he plays his very best golf.
Leishman  ->  positive

Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
Glover’s  ->  positive

Branden Grace swing sequence:  This will be the eighth time the CIMB Classic has featured on the PGA Tour. Ben Crane was the winner in 2010 and, since then, Bo Van Pelt, Nick Watney, Ryan Moore and Justin Thomas have been champions. In 2014, Moore successfully defended the title he first won in 2013.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Don’t be shy with him this week. UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($10,600) – The tougher the track, the more I love Rickie. He’s been a force on tour this year at the toughest of venues, and I would call him one of the better values in the field for his price even if it is a bit steep.
Rickie  ->  positive

In terms of shooting low scores, 3 of Brandt's wins have come with resort scoring totals of -22/266, -19/267 and -22/265. With his play into late December combined with his result CV, Snedeker is undoubtedly the sort of player who wins this season opener. RESULT: T14  Justin Thomas 2pts EW 22/1 with NEW OFFER!
Snedeker  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  MY PICK : Martin Kaymer ($9,500)  Martin Kaymer hasn’t won since his victory at the U.S. Open in 2014, but he does have a great streak of 28 starts without a missed cut going and should generally be considered the class of a fairly weak field this week. While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence.
Kaymer  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

He tied for fourth in this tournament two years ago. Jonathan Coachman: Jordan Spieth ($12,600)  I normally hate to pick back-to-back winners, but what I've seen in Spieth is very Tiger-esque. By turning down guaranteed money overseas, he is telling the world that he's serious about being dominant like he was in 2015.
Spieth  ->  positive

Danny Lee  3. Jonas Blixt  MY PICK : Paul Casey ($8,800)  Casey, remarkably, has only one win on US soil thus far in what has otherwise been a very impressive career. While he’s let some opportunities slide by recently, his game is still in top form.
Casey  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
Stenson  ->  positive

Moore ranked 34th for DD and 12th for DA. Jordan Spieth, who is missing the tournament for the second year in-a-row, has won two of the last four renewals because he's scrambled and putted brilliantly and Moore ranked first for Scrambling and sixth for Putting Average, but the secret to success here is usually relentlessly finding the putting surfaces. Greens In Regulation is the most important stat but how you play the par fives is key too.
Moore  ->  positive

Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week.
Rodgers  ->  positive

He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.

Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view. RESULT: T9  Tony Finau 1pt EW 45/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Matthew Fitzpatrick 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £30 welcome offer for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  Based on his 6th at Torrey Pines and runner-up finish behind Bubba Watson at Riviera, Tony Finau is another player who can clearly play the Kikuyu/Poa Annua combination effectively and whilst he's playing as well as he is, he's got a live chance here. Length may be the Utah bomber's main asset, however when he's playing well he can regularly find greens in their requisite number - for the past 6 months or so that's been a feature of his play that's seen him produce 5 top-7 finishes in 10 starts overall.
Watson's  ->  positive

After his recent missed cut (one of the few he’s had all year) I suspect he will fall off of most peoples radars. Another golfer in a very similar situation is Jason Dufner, who is well publicized to have worked heavily on his putting game all off season and it seems to be showing. It seems with his added putting skill the regular 45th place finishes of 2016 are starting to become top 25 finishes with some real upside mixed into the fold.
Jason Dufner,  ->  positive

Harris English put in a strange performance last week, playing brilliantly one day and awful the next but nobody bettered his six-under-par 65 on Sunday so I thought I'd chance him at a triple-figure price, given he's a former OHL Classic winner, and I've also thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned Aussie, Aaron Baddeley, at a huge price. Selections:  Billy Horschel @ [40.0]  Harris English @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [180.0]  I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Aaron Baddeley,  ->  positive

Add to this his ranking of 38th in Stroked Gained: Around-the-Green and Kisner ranks an impressive 5th in Strokes Gained: Total. Kisner also ranks 12th in Driving Accuracy, but ranking just 132nd in Driving Distance (286.4 yards) meant his Total Driving ranking couldn’t be any better than 32nd. Distance isn’t everything, and for someone of Kisner’s accuracy off the tee, his relative lack of power isn’t too much of a concern.
Kisner  ->  positive

Given the combination of course form, recent form and statistical positives, he’s entitled to go very well this week. My next best is Brian Harman who himself notched a second career PGA Tour win at the Wells Fargo Championship back in May, having recorded his maiden victory at this very tournament back in 2014. He followed that Wells Fargo triumph with a career best major performance at the US Open in June, holding the 54 hole lead before ultimately finishing runner up to an inspired Brooks Koepka.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

After returning from a lengthy lay-off to finish T7 in Mexico last week, Rory will want to continue his build towards Augusta and he'll view top 10 here as a minimum. Last four events: 7-2-9-4  Course form: 27-11  Florida form: 12-27-3-MC-8-11-9-MC-6-25-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 14%, Top 5: 46%, Top 10: 64%    Henrik Stenson  As suspected, Stenson quickly recovered from his WD in Mexico (food poisoning) to extend his run of top 10s to six (in completed events at least) with T7 in last week's Valspar Championship. This is an event he should have won in 2015 (three-putted 15 and 16 when on the clock) and either side of that second place he made the top five in 2014 and 2016 so this really is a great course for him.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Spieth was Top 10 in virtually every major statistic last season including strokes gained: tee-to-green, strokes gained: approach, and birdie or better %. Overall, Spieth has been as dominant at this course as any other in his career. Dustin Johnson ($10,300) – It was a very hard to choose between the long hitter in Dustin Johnson who can just overpower this course, or Jordan Spieth who always plays well here.
Spieth  ->  positive

That leaves me with Steele and Hoffman. Hoffman grades out better in total course history, current form, and is only slightly worse in long-term performance. I will go with Charley Hoffman this week.
Hoffman.  ->  positive

The good news is that these types of disasters will probably continue to make him an affordable option in stronger fields, so he’ll need to stay in the consideration set even with these Sunday struggles. Brandt Snedeker: Well, I refused to pay the $10K for him because outside of two wins at Pebble, his average finish was legit T50. Brandt continues to punish me for failing to believe that he loves California, putting up a solid 4th place finish.
Brandt  ->  positive

Going to be significantly overweight the field on Casey. Rickie Fowler ($10,500) – The MC at the Fedex St. Jude have you scared away? Fowler is an excellent play in tournaments for that very reason.

On my sheet, he ranks Top 20 in Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Around the Green, Par 4 Scoring, and Birdie or Better % and over the last 24 rounds when looking at current stats form, he ranks Top 30 in each category as well(see below).
Ollie  ->  positive

However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark. In 14 starts here, he's backed five top-10 finishes, missing the cut only once, and it was encouraging to see a return to bermuda provoke an improved putting display when he finished 14th at the Valspar Championship last week.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play. The Texan is a great pick for any of the major championships.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

Let’s take a look at options for your cash lineup this week in Texas. Brendan Steele, $8900 – Steele missed the cut at the Masters, ending a solid start to the 2018 season. There’s hope that the MC will lower ownership, but more than likely, folks will be on the Steele bandwagon and for good reason.
Steele,  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience. He has had significant success at British Opens in the past, and I believe his superb T2G game and should put him squarely in the conversation to ship this event, particularly if the conditions get nasty.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Thomas 3pts EW 11/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  At the very top of the market, I don't like Rickie Fowler this week who's extremely short and has up until this point had a horrid time when it comes to defending his all too infrequent victories. I'm sure Rory McIlroy will be popular on a course where he's won and finished runner-up in the very near past.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Patton Kizzire, who won the aforementioned OHL Classic nicely in November missed the cut on debut 12 months ago and he didn't put brilliantly last week when finishing 15th but I thought [85.0] was juicy enough for him. And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average.
Stroud,  ->  positive

From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th). Finau also ranks 21st in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green and whilst he has seemingly struggled on the 450-500 yard Par 4’s (78th), I am confident he can post another strong finish around this track. At 50/1 you are getting a player in good form, with quality course form to boot.
Finau  ->  positive

Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Selections  Unless I get a fabulous angle in, I always take it steady at a new venue and so stakes are small this week but I couldn't resist a wager on DJ, who isn't that much shorter to win here than he was to win the US Masters, and I've had a couple of tiny bets on the two Eagle Point members - Simpson and Pettersson. The latter named is a really speculative punt but I quite like Simpson. Like DJ, his record on Bentgrass greens is very good and he arrives at Eagle Point in fair form given he was beaten in a playoff in Phoenix in February and that he was tied 11th at the Heritage last time out.
Simpson  ->  positive

Spieth leads the field in strokes gained approach, is 2nd in greens in regulation, 2nd in proximity and 4th in par 4 birdie percentage.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Motivation-wise he sits 51st in the FEC standings so needs to move quickly to guarantee his Tour Championship spot and, more interestingly, his recent record at TPC Boston is not the best and he was only 16th at Crooked Stick in 2012, although he was defending the title so that needs to be taken into account. But all of this is superseded by the fact that when Rose is at the top of his game he strings excellent results together. I think back to 2010 when after winning his first PGA Tour title at The Memorial, in his next outing he led by 3 shots going into Sunday at the Travelers Championship, eventually capitulating Sunday and finishing 9th - Justin Rose in 2016 would not do that.
Rose  ->  positive

Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
Hughes  ->  positive

All of them placed inside the top 6 last year here. FTW I’m going to go with Adam Scott ($12,200) as my put a gun to my head pick. Fades:  Last Week’s Results: Bubba MC’d, and naturally Laird was a top 10… what a surprise.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag.
McGirt  ->  positive

Daniel Berger;  ->  positive

Look at previous winners here and it's noticeable that Danny Lee was a runner-up in Puerto Rico back in 2014 and Angel Cabrera finished 7th there in 2011. If the confidence continues with the flat stick there's no reason why DeChambeau doesn't feature this week. Result: T14  Smylie Kaufman 0.5pt EW 150/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  5th as recently as Eagle Point, I also think that Smylie Kaufman is worth a speculative punt at a big price, especially at a tournament where shock results seem normal.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

The three I like best are former winner Aaron Baddeley, who caught the eye at the Shell Houston Open a fortnight ago when he finished 15th, ranking second for Scrambling, Blayne Barber, who was beaten in a playoff at the RSM Classic last year, and Zac Blair, who I thought was a fair price at [250.0] given he currently ranks second for Scrambling and that he finished eighth at the Shell. Selections:  Aaron Baddeley @ [160.0]  Zac Blair @ [250.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [400.0]  Blayne Barber @ [500.0]  Ben Crane @ [600.0]  Davis Love III @ [600.0]    I'll be back later with my Trophée Hassan II preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Zac Blair,  ->  positive

He ranks seventh on the tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and putts per round. His spot in a pool with Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia will help temper ownership despite his play. O'Hair has made the cut four out of six tries at August National and in seven of his past nine tour events.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Justin Rose – $11,400  If I am picking between any of the guys at the top, Justin Rose is the first guy on the list. Rose has back-to-back top five finishes and has come inside the top 10 an incredible 11 of his last 13 tournaments.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

This course is the ideal test for Bohn right now as he looks for a return to form. He has made just 6 of 15 cuts since returning, and his best finish was T35. The trouble is Bohn has struggled, understandably since suffering a heart attack at the Honda Classic last year.
Bohn  ->  positive

Back nearer the front of the betting, Paul Casey is certainly an each-way shout at 22s and perhaps more than that after finally getting his first win on American soil since 2009 when landing the Valspar Championship. Rickie Fowler and Marc Leishman fit best on the 10-year-trends and are worthy of inspection while who knows what Ian Poulter (three top 10s at Augusta) is capable of after booking his place with a win in Houston last week. But you can't back them all and I'm happy to let Spieth and Mickelson lead the charge with Aphibarnrat playing the role of surprise contender.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

I've also thrown a few pennies at another of last year's selections - the 2010 Farmers winner, Ben Crane. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [8.4]  J.B Holmes @ [55.0]  Scott Stallings @ [75.0]  Harris English @ [85.0]  C.T Pan @ [180.0]  Ben Crane @ [230.0]  K.J Choi @ [330.0]      I'll be back with the In-Play Blog on Thursday or Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Ben Crane.  ->  positive

He could threaten a place putting badly and it's in the hope that a few weeks off have helped him find something that the Kentucky native gets the vote. Of the many tempting options at three-figure prices, it's Andrew Landry who stands out. Born in Texas, Landry won a couple of minor tour events in his home state before turning professional and hinting that difficult conditions may bring out his best when scoring a five-shot victory in 11-under-par on the Web.com Tour.
Andrew Landry  ->  positive

Only two months removed from a co-runner-up performance at his national open. Sam Saunders … It's always notable whenever any golfer deep in the Web.com Tour reshuffle category (in which he's positioned 39th) sits out an event on the West Coast Swing as he did at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, but with a T25 at Waialae and a T8 in the Coachella Valley to lead off the restart of the season, he built a foundation to sustain a regular schedule for the remainder. It also bought him a two-week recharge for his eighth appearance on the Monterey Peninsula.
Sam Saunders  ->  positive

Adam Scott has been one of the hottest golfers in the world over the past month. It’s been several months since this Aussie last notched a podium finish on the PGA Tour, but we can’t be too disappointed with three consecutive fourths to open the FedEx Cup playoffs. Needless to say, Scott will bring plenty of momentum into this week, which should give him a fighting chance against the Days and Spieths of the world.
Scott  ->  positive

Danny Lee ($10,200) has a great blend of recent form and course history. Lee has made seven straight cuts this year. When Lee last played this event in 2015, he finished in third place.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
Reed  ->  negative

Rafa should be well rested after a weekend off last week and looks decent value to have another good week in Houston. Final Selections –  Phil Mickelson 12/1 1pt EW  Luke List 25/1 1pt EW  Rafa Cabrera Bello 33/1 1pt EW  Total staked = 6pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf. Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter – @DoublebogeyDB6  Follow me on Facebook – www.facebook.com/doublebogey6
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

He putted well last week when finishing tied for 23rd and I thought he was worth another chance at a huge price. Selections:  Jon Rahm @ [29.0]  Jimmy Walker @ [50.0]  Ryan Blaum @ [160.0]  Ben Crane @ [200.0]    I'll be back with the In-Play Blog on Thursday or Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR. It was therefore with some amusement that those of us on this side of the pond watched the US lead coverage from Torrey Pines 3 weeks ago, during which we were treated to interviews and commentary that portrayed Alex as a complete rookie, who would potentially react like a rabbit in the headlights when faced with the possibility of winning on US soil!
NOREN  ->  positive

Johnson was unlucky not to win the PGA Championship back in 2010, receiving a two-stroke penalty in the final-round, which cost him a place in the play-off with Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer. Six years on, Johnson finally got his first major win at the U.S. Open and he only looked forward from there. Following that win at the U.S. Open last June he has won five times, including three WGC’s.
Johnson  ->  positive

However, this course has historically had scores finish in the teens under par. Cash Game Plays  Tony Finau ($16,200) – Finau just pops off the page at me with his odds and price. MILTON (Yes that is his real first name) is playing excellent golf and his ball striking is on FIRE.
Finau  ->  positive

But most of it has to do with Hadwin’s elite iron play the past six weeks. Hadwin is averaging 5.3 strokes gained on his approaches over his last three starts, good for finishes of T6, T9 and T12. And the best part, like Spieth, is that he’s putting like garbage, losing strokes in four of his past five turns.
Hadwin’s  ->  positive

Holmes won’t be highlighted in many places this week as this is more of a course fit play than a stats-based play, so he should come in at low-ownership. Chris Kirk ($7500): Entering the week after a 13th-place finish at Bay Hill, Kirk is very underpriced for this tournament considering his excellent form this year: three finishes of 13th or better, three finishes between T33 and T49, and his two missed cuts both came at 54-hole cut events. Kirk is underpriced thanks to not having played this tournament since 2014 (T65), but he’s yet to miss a cut in three shots at it, and also has a T22 and a runner-up finish(!)
Kirk  ->  positive

Knox at 45/1 could also be a strong bet but I'll side with RCB. Outsider: Back Lucas Glover EW @ 150/1  We've done well with the long-shots in recent weeks with 200/1 Scott Stallings grabbing full each-way return at Pebble Beach and 100/1 Martin Laird missing out on a place by a single shot at Riviera. So let's try another triple-figure punt with 150/1 chance Lucas Glover.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

That explains why he didn't tee it up in March and it was encouraging to see him sit 12th through 54 holes last week on his first start since becoming a father, before a difficult back-nine on Sunday undid much of the good work. We often talk about Keith Elliott's nappy factor as a potential trigger for improved play and while it's far from an exact science, given Landry's local ties, preference for a tough course, brace of top-five finishes this season and sneakily-good effort at Harbour Town last week, I'm more than willing to chance him at the odds. Local ties have been important here in the past with the likes of Bowditch and Jimmy Walker taking the title, and they point towards Tom Hoge perhaps going better than many expect.
Landry's  ->  positive

The PGA picks are back! Sony Open: Winner: Spieth Top 10: Howell, Woodland, Dufner DK Sleepers: Knox, Kirk OAD: Chucky Three-Stix
Spieth  ->  positive

All the stars aligned for Holmes, as they had done for Jones 12 months earlier and in the fullness of time, these two results could well be viewed upon as freakish. Prior to 2014, Adam Scott in 2007, who benefited from a late Stuart Appleby collapse, had been the only winner not to be within two of the lead with a round to go and every winner bar Holmes has been inside the top-four places after 54 holes. The short par four 12th is easy enough and the par five 13th ranked the second easiest on the course last year but after that the finish is tough enough with the par five 15th the only easy hole coming in.
Holmes,  ->  positive

And at a similar price, Louis Oosthuizen and Francesco Molinari have not a single victory on American soil between them. As for the stats this season, Haas is 13th in Greens In Regulation, 15th in Scoring Average, 25th in Sand Saves and 5th in Scrambling. He also appears on Future of Fantasy's top 25 performers on Bentgrass greens (since 2013-14) and those are the surfaces in play this week.
Haas  ->  positive

Read below for my winner, chalk and sleepers. Predicted Winner: Bill Haas  Chalky players: Kevin Na, Dufner, Graham DeLaet and Luke Donald. Sleepers: Steve Stricker and Charley Hoffman  Hidden Sleeper I didn't mention in my video: Ollie Schniederjans
Bill Haas  ->  positive

His best finish in this event came in 2014 when he finished fourth. Spieth's stats line up well for the three courses this week. He ranked fourth in BoB% and Par 5 scoring last season, and this year ranks second in both.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Those factors are in play again here at Copperhead, where he’s made the weekend on every visit bar his 2004 debut, won in 2010, lost a play-off in 2012, and has since finished seventh, 20th and 40th. Unsurprisingly, he’s called this course one of his favourites and I’ve seen enough in Furyk’s play not just last year but over the last few weeks to believe he can get competitive. Chris Kirk’s long game looks to have come good at a nice time given that he’s a Georgia man who is not currently in the Masters and it’ll be interesting to see if he can press on and first secure a place first in the WGC-Match Play which is coming up.
Furyk’s  ->  positive

We estimate his ownership to fall between 26 – 30%. Value Plays:  Adam Scott $8,600 – Scott is another guy who performed well last week with three rounds in the 60’s, and has always been a premier ball striker. He ranks high in this field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his Vegas odds to win are better or the same as Stenson, Garcia, Thomas, and Kuchar.
Scott  ->  positive

Five Under Five  Mr. Miyagi  As discussed in this week’s Course Breakdown, Ben Crane has had success at some similar TPC courses. In five events at TPC Southwind and The Old White TPC since 2014, Crane has exceeded his salary-based expectations four times (80.0 percent), averaging a strong +16.20 Plus/Minus on DraftKings:  Moreover, Crane dropped 74.50 DraftKings points at TPC Southwind earlier this month, good for a whopping +25.73 Plus/Minus. Additionally, it’s likely that Crane will keep his tee shots out of trouble this week: Crane is tied for 12th in the field with his 65.6 Driving Accuracy (DA) percentage.
Crane  ->  positive

At 66/1 you are getting a young player with a huge amount of talent, who is still yet to reach the peak of his potential. Zach Johnson 80/1 (Ladbrokes 6 places ¼ odds Betfair 8 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Like Fowler I am also sticking with Zach Johnson for the second major in a row. The two-time major winner played well enough at Birkdale (14th) before finishing 2nd behind a ridiculously impressive, Matsuyama at Firestone.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

All kidding aside it is testament to this event that so many fans and players turn up here year-on-year given the clash in schedule. ADVERTISEMENT  Three of the last five winners have been straight out the top drawer with Hideki Matsuyama (2016), Brooks Koepka (2015) and Phil Mickelson (2013) winning in recent years. Whilst Koepka wasn’t a surprise winner, it was still his maiden win and as a result three of the last five winners have also been first-time PGA Tour winners.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Putting 10'-15', BoB% (Birdie or Better), Bogey Avoidance, Scrambling, Rough Proximity. Top-Tier Plays  Dustin Johnson ($11,100)  Dustin Johnson is "Taylor Made" for this course. He ranked sixth or better in three of our key stats from 2016 (1stt in BoB%, 4th in Par 5 Scoring, and 6th in Rough Proximity).
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Look for List to stay hot at Bay Hill this week, where he placed T17 during his API debut in 2017. Kiradech Aphibarnrat - $14,100    Aphibarnrat traveled to the tiny nation of Brunei this past week for the Richard Mille Brunei Championships of the Asian Development Tour, where he was not only the featured entrant, but eventual champion by a whole six strokes at 23-under-par. He’s now up to a pair of wins in his last four starts, having won the ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth last month as well.
Kiradech Aphibarnrat  ->  positive

Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago. Campbell has made seven of his last eight cuts with no finish worse than 34th. The field has caught on as Campbell has regularly been on of the highest owned options in cash his last 2 events.
Campbell  ->  positive

The runner-up at last year’s US Open has clearly given him new belief and whilst he has another hard to win with, a top placing is certainly on the cards. Daniel Berger has a similar profile to Harman but the same can be said of Kisner and Dufner – so many ball-strikers that come to the fore when bombing is taking out of the equation. However, the final vote goes to Tom Hoge.
Harman  ->  positive

As a native Californian it’s not surprising that Beau cooled off a bit once the tour reached Florida however I am hoping that a trip to his adopted home state of Texas will reignite things. Hossler had a stellar career at the University of Texas and in 2017 he received a sponsors exemption in to the field of this week’s event. Beau rewarded this exemption by finishing 39th.
Hossler  ->  positive

Jason Dufner - Jason Dufner has three straight top-25 finishes and enters this week ranked 14th in driving accuracy percentage and sand save percentage. Dufner is hitting a good ball right now and enters an event where he’s finished top-30 in each of his last eight appearances. There’s no reason not to like Dufner this week, especially when he’s getting odds of +4000 to win.
Dufner  ->  positive

This year's Phoenix Open winner, Gary Woodland, doesn't frank the form particularly well. In his sole appearance in this event, he could only finish 33rd but the man he beat in the playoff in Phoenix, Chez Reavie, finished seventh here in his only appearance back in 2016. And that's especially pertinent given Reavie only managed three top-tens all year in 2016 and he was out of form when he finished seventh here.
Reavie,  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?
Matt Kuchar  ->  negative

Throw in his wildness off the tee -- a shortcoming that's severely penalized at the Greenbrier -- and I'm staying away. Expert Picks  Kevin Kisner  Danny Lee  Keegan Bradley  Bill Haas  Patrick Reed  Sung Kang  Gary Woodland  Xander Schauffele  Webb Simpson  Russell Henley  Pinterest Icon Sportswire  Expert Explanation : Does Kisner even need rationale? Kisner has six top-10 finishes on the season, and was a runner-up the last time this event was played.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

He added a further T10 in the Open de France at the start of July but either side missed the cut in the U.S. Open and also when defending in Scotland last week. Those two results aren't ideal but I prefer to look at the bigger picture which shows Noren sat at No.9 in the world rankings above Fowler, Koepka, Rose, Thomas and others that are higher on many punters' radars. One obvious negative thrown at Noren is his poor record in the majors and the bare facts don't look great.
Rose,  ->  positive

But you can't back them all and I'm happy to let Spieth and Mickelson lead the charge with Aphibarnrat playing the role of surprise contender. Rickie Fowler and Marc Leishman fit best on the 10-year-trends and are worthy of inspection while who knows what Ian Poulter (three top 10s at Augusta) is capable of after booking his place with a win in Houston last week. Back nearer the front of the betting, Paul Casey is certainly an each-way shout at 22s and perhaps more than that after finally getting his first win on American soil since 2009 when landing the Valspar Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

22 East Asia appearances have generated 8th at the 2013 BMW Masters, 8th at the 2014 Volvo China Open and 2nd last time Rafael visited the area at last year's Hong Kong Open at Fanling. RESULT: T11  Cameron Smith 1pt EW 45/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Young Aussie sensation Cameron Smith has to be a danger this week. Equally adept at grinding or reeling off par-breakers, the 24 year-old from the Gold Coast must be full of confidence after his second top-5 finish at TPC Kuala Lumpur last week and at a course in South Korea that nobody has competitive knowledge of, his experience on the Asian Tour puts him in good stead.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Prior to missing the cut at Harbour Town, he'd extended his flawless Augusta record with an eighth cut made from eight starts there, having previously reached the semi-finals of the WGC-Match Play in Texas. He's also won at places like Riviera and Congressional which may also tie in quite nicely with Eagle Point, he putts well on bentgrass greens and has twice won after a missed cut before, so Haas looks the most attractive each-way bet towards the top of the market. Lucas Glover is another with local ties via Clemson, he's won this event before and his long-game remains as sharp as ever, but the greens here at Eagle Point look as pure as they come and he might just find himself giving up too much ground on them.
Haas  ->  positive

Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. (2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III.
Murray  ->  positive

– –  These are my two early picks and whilst I may add one or two in the next couple of days, I really like the chances of both Rose and Haas this week. Haas has also now posted top-10’s at both the Open Championship and U.S. Open, something he hadn’t done in major championships until last season, adding to his big event pedigree. Considering he already has six wins and would be nearer 10, if other play-offs went his way, the 35-year old is clearly more than capable of winning at the top level.
Rose  ->  positive

Obviously, his stellar recent form has lead to some pretty impressive statistics. Kang ranks inside the top 30 for this field in all of the strokes gained stats other than around the green. He scores very well on Par 4s and is a very solid birdie maker.
Kang  ->  positive

It’s a tough one to call so approach with caution. Bill Haas 20/1  Bill Haas has had a decent start to the season with four top 20 finishes in his last four starts. He started with a respectable T20 at the Safeway Open and followed that with a T4 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China where he didnt shoot worse than a 70 throughout the week to finish 15 under for the tournament.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Genesis Open Bets: Outright: DJ Scott E/W: Casey Grace Pieters English Long Shot: Donald FRL: List
Scott  ->  positive

The major concern from the Texas native is his poor course history here, missing the cut three times since the course converted from Bentgrass greens, but he’s talented enough in other areas to ignore that, on top of the fact that Gay has had an excellent season with three top–10s and is coming into the week off of a T42 at the Barracuda. One of the main things that has held Gay back throughout his career is his lack of distance, which won’t be an issue, but he’s above average (34th) in driving accuracy and is absolutely deadly with a wedge. He’ll struggle on the longer par-4s, but expect him to find lots of fairways and score on the shorter holes.
Gay  ->  positive

Finally, all be it a slightly different type of ‘ comeback from disappointment’, came as recently as three weeks ago when Ian Poulter overcame the huge upset of having a Masters appearance basically handed to him then taken away only to deliver the necessary win the following week in Houston. So, the evidence is there that with the right mentality a player can come back out the next week and overcome a huge disappointment from the previous, and there is no doubt Si Woo Kim is a special talent who has the ability to do so, but can he do it on this course? Well, as I’ve mentioned already I believe Si Woo’s long game attributes for the course aren’t in doubt and he played solidly here last year to finish 22nd.
Si Woo Kim  ->  positive

Play him with absolute confidence. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Kyle Stanley ($6700) : Stanley finally picked up his first win in years at the Quicken Loans National, and he managed to pull it off while losing strokes to the field with his putter. That speaks to just how talented a golfer he is getting from tee to green, and at an incredible value of only $6700, Stanley is almost a must-play.
Stanley  ->  positive

Kuchar will have gained a lot mentally for going head-to-head with Spieth at Royal Birkdale and at a tournament where the true elite often have a week off, I think Kuchar has a big chance to gain his first win since 2014. RESULT: T10  Charley Hoffman 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Charley Hoffman sits at 11th in the FedEx Cup standings and similar to 2016 Barclays champion Patrick Reed, who resided in the final Ryder Cup qualification spot this time last year prior to winning, he also finds himself in the last automatic qualification spot for the Presidents Cup right now. He also shares another compelling fact with Reed from last year: with 7 top-10s in 2017, Charley is the highest player in the FEC not to have won this season.
Charley  ->  positive

Back in November, he was runner-up at the RSM Classic while the Florida man has some good Web.com form in Louisiana (T11 and T6). He's a good putter (24th in Strokes Gained: Putting) while the pair are 18th (Henley) and 56th respectively in the Birdie Average stats. There's only one round of evidence of them playing together as pros but at least it's positive.
(Henley)  ->  positive

Poulter has won eight times from October to December versus just two titles across the preceding three months and while that's in part due to field strength, it's also a reflection of the fact he so often has had more to play for than others as the campaign draws to a close. At 54th in the world rankings that's very much the case once more and Poulter will know that gaining access to next year's majors and World Golf Championships is his best route back into the Ryder Cup side. Today was the sweatiest I've ever been on a golf course... battled back after a poor start.. 5 under on my back 9.
Poulter  ->  positive

He is no stranger to windy seaside courses winning at venues such as St Andrews in 2015, Hyundai TOC in Kapalua in 2014 and the RBC Heritage in Harbour Town in 2012. Top 20 double – Charles Howell (Sony)/Jason Scrivener (SA Open) @10/1  Charles Howell has a ridiculously good record here in Waialae with eight top 20’s (including seven top 10’s) in his last 12 appearances here. He has three top 20’s in his last four starts so far this season and looks to be in decent form and well worth backing.
Charles  ->  positive

To counter-act his Scrambling issues, there’s a good chance he won’t have to rely on his wedge game much, as he ranks 9th in approaches from 150-175 and 23rd from 175-200, which is fantastic given how important these ranges are this week. Scrambling aside he looks in fine shape ahead of his eight start in this event, and I am confident new father, Bradley can get his fourth PGA Tour victory and his first in almost six years. At 80/1 I am happy to take a chance on a former top prospect, given his 2nd and 5th place finishes at the CIMB Classic and Farmers Insurance Open respectively this season.
Bradley  ->  positive

Jhonattan Vegas  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($8,700)  It is a bit of a home game for Vegas this week as he attended the University of Texas just two hours down the road. Looking over a quote from last year(via Future of Fantasy Golfanac), Vegas is clearly comfortable playing here and it shows with the results recently as he has T15 and T19 in his last two trips to the Houston Open. He made an early exit from the WGC Match Play last week but did have a T20 at the WGC Mexico at the start of March and has made nine of 11 cuts so far this year so there is even some nice form coming in this time around.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

(Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Bill Haas ($7,000). His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000.
Haas  ->  positive

He’s posted T23/T12/T14 in his last three starts, and sits Top 15 in the field in ball-striking, Par 5s gained, and birdie or better gained over the past 24 rounds. Jamie Lovemark  Generally worse off the tee than than you’d like, but he’s found himself gaining strokes with the smoke wagon again once the tour shifted away from less-than-driver tracks, picking up an average of 2.65 strokes gained off the tee at API and Houston. If that problem’s truly fixed — or at least won’t be a liability — Lovemark’s primed to tear apart TPC San Antonio.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English.
Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Both of those ranks improved as a result of his play in Memphis. Kyle Stanley … Like a Major League Baseball talent with an option remaining and thus returns to Triple-A frequently, he's been a regular "call-up" to this section all season, at least when he hasn't cracked the Power Rankings. A modest 3-for-7 record at TPC River Highlands doesn't tell the entire story since two of those paydays went for a top 20.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor. : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week.
Henley  ->  positive

Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play. Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G.
Suri  ->  positive

It's no surprise a player of his calibre got it done. Rather than rest on his laurels now that goal has been ticked off, Mickelson appears far more likely to use it as motivation once more, justifying his selection with another big week which he still needs to qualify for the TOUR Championship. A two-time winner of that event, he will be as keen as ever to get back to East Lake and could yet win the FedEx Cup which, along with that elusive US Open title, is among the few things missing from his packed trophy cabinet.
Mickelson  ->  positive

He will be chalk in the top tier but I think there is more than enough ways to separate yourself with your other five golfers. Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,000)  FanDuel ($8,200)  Rose is another golfer that nails down both the PGA Championship and Wells Fargo Championship history this week. There was a stretch where he missed three straight cuts at the PGA but over the past five years has two Top 5's(2012 & 2015) and has not finished worse than 33rd.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

From a correlating course perspective, his 4th at PGA National in February works very nicely with the likes of previous winners here Fowler and McIlroy being Honda Classic champions. Fleetwood's 2 Abu Dhabi successes also make sense with Quail victors Woods (3rd 2012), McIlroy (4 runner-up spots) and Fowler (1st 2016) all having success at Abu Dhabi Golf Club. You can even look at Tommy's 2nd at the 2017 WGC played at Chapultepec in a positive way with 2018 winner and runner-up Phil Mickelson and Justin Thomas not having a bad record at Quail Hollow.
Fleetwood's  ->  positive

As we know from experience though this will quite possibly change! PICKS  I have gone with five players this week as follows;  LUKE LIST – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finished 24th  I must confess that the idea of backing a PGA tour maiden at 33-1 was of slight concern to me, however every time I went over the entry list and the accompanying data and stats I ended up with List at the top of the list [no pun intended] and ultimately I felt I just couldn’t leave him out. The case for him this week is a fairly obvious one.
List  ->  positive

However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
Reed  ->  negative

It took a final round 68 to shoot up the leaderboard here last year, but 74 was his worst round of the week showing he played four pretty steady rounds on this tough course. With soft conditions possible, after heavy rain Monday which may be followed with more on Thursday, Holmes’ distance off the tee could be vital. Holmes missed his first cut since last August in Houston last week, but he wasn’t alone, with players such as Spieth, Adam Scott and Patrick Reed also missing the cut in what was a strange, weather-affected Houston Open.
Holmes’  ->  positive

Ishikawa looks to be in flying form and after playing well here twice before, he could another player to keep an eye on at generous odds. Final selections –  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 18/1  Scott Piercy 1pt EW 28/1  Grayson Murray 0.5pts EW 55/1  Ryo Ishikawa 0.5pts EW 70/1  Total staked = 6pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf.

STATS  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Off the Tee  Putting  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Birdie or Better %  Par-5 Scoring  Approach: Outside 175 Yards  Greens in Regulation  Par-3 Scoring  Top-Tier Golfers  Luke List ($9600): Consistently one of the best on Tour from tee to green, List is sure to be a popular pick on DraftKings this year, as he’s having a strong year and his putter is only losing a marginal amount of strokes (-0.051) when compared to years past (-0.426, -0.273 in the previous two years). List finished T3 here last year in shooting -16 over his four rounds and finished T27 in 2016; he did miss the cut with a 77-72 back in 2013, but that’s ancient history for List. This season, List has only missed three cuts (OHL, Sony Open, CareerBuilder) while picking up a whopping seven top-25 finishes in his 14 events.

#WhoLitTheKiz. Russell Henley $7,800 – We’re REALLLLYYY hoping Henley stays under the radar this week and goes lower owned in DFS contests. The former Georgia Bulldog has finished T20 or better two out of the last five seasons on the PGA Tour and his first win came in Hawaii in 2013.
Henley  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
Rickie Fowler's  ->  positive

Stuard is 6 for 6 in cuts made on the season with three Top 10’s and Flores is 4 for 5 in cuts made with some decent success here. Sample Line-Up  Reed – Mickelson – Stuard – Armour – Flores – Martin  Fade of the Week  Webb Simpson  After choosing Cam Smith for the TOC who placed 17th of 34 players and CHIII last week who placed 32nd I try my luck at choosing another good fade play. Webb Simpson will be very high owned this week as it seems he has found his putting stroke.

I'm sure some will follow the trail from Grace to the Dunhill Links and consider both Tyrrell Hatton and Martin Kaymer, former winners of that event, but my final vote is another speculative one in favour of John Peterson. An excellent ball-striker, Peterson led the field in greens as he finished inside the top 20 here on his last visit and, like Poulter, has been playing some good golf since returning from injury. Peterson's results have been more impressive, with two top-25 finishes in his last three starts, and perhaps with a baby on the way he'll find a level of calm on the course that has so far escaped this talented underachiever.
Peterson.  ->  positive

When you weigh it all up its hard not to fancy Rickie’s chances here in Erin Hills. Jon Rahm 20/1  Big hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm has made quite an impact on the PGA Tour this season with a win and seven top 10’s under his belt so far. After shooting a final round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open in February, Rahm bagged his first PGA Tour win at previous US Open venue, Torrey Pines, finishing on 13 under par in total.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

It came across clumsily although essentially he's right with Woods admitting he wasn't tournament ready to play the Masters. The negativity hasn't affected Perez though and, given his numbers (also 7th in both the Money List and FedEx Cup rankings), I'm surprised to see him at 50/1 in this field. Have an each-way punt.
Perez  ->  positive

Jordan improved his game and especially putting during his last start (Genesis Open) on a course (Riviera) that is very comparable to this weeks venue Club de Golf Chapultepec. As far as stats go, Mr. Spieth is checking all the boxes and ranks top 10 in the field in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, Strokes Gained: Approach and also number one in the field in Scrambling. The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups.
Jordan  ->  positive

“Humming” would be putting it lightly for the excellence Fowler has displayed over the past few months, and he will be an absolutely essential consideration at Augusta. Jon Rahm: But guys, he’s tired, right?! Rahm is 22 years old and a golfing machine, carding yet another top-ten at a course he’s never played before.
Jon Rahm:  ->  positive

Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
English  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth – $11,000  Even after Spieth’s second place finish last week at the Dean and Deluca, he only has 14 tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to Rahm who has 34. Rahm will soak up so much of Spieth’s ownership, along with the other top names in the field, it is possible we could see a sub 10% number on Spieth. Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Despite that collapse, Stanley seems to like this course finishing T25 in 2016 and T14 last year and looks great value to have a good week here.

The weather looks sunny and dry with moderate wind so scoring should be good. Tommy Fleetwood 16/1  The current number 2 in the Race to Dubai is trending in the right direction and judging by last week’s performance in Florida, looks to be hitting the ball nicely coming into this week. He has been playing solid over the last couple of months showing form figures 4,37,6,1,3,6,21,10 in his last eight starts.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

He's still likely to be under-owned in most formats, but he has plenty of upside at a bargain price. -- Zach Turcotte  Luke List  The Arnold Palmer Invitational sets up to be another good spot for Luke List after quality fantasy performances in the Valspar Championship, Honda Classic, Genesis Open, Waste Management Phoenix Open and Farmers Insurance Open. Rating near the top in BOB% and Par-5 Scoring, List should do his fair share of scoring at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge.
Luke List  ->  positive

His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour.
Cink  ->  negative

When 3rd here in 2014, Scott ranked 14th in SG: Putting, and that will be the sort of ranking he will need to achieve this week. Zach Johnson 66/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Zach Johnson has quietly been playing very solidly in 2018 and he looks to be returning to something close to winning form. Johnson has finished inside the top-23 in six of his seven starts this season, with the T57 finish at the Phoenix Open the exception.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

The PGA Tour heads for West Virginia this week where New Zealand’s Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic over The Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs. Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic this week against a field that includes Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Four places in The Open Championship are available to the top finishers who are not already exempt for Royal Birkdale.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Look for Rickie to get on track for another big Majors run like 2014. J.B. Holmes  World Golf Ranking (#37)  Vegas Odds (33/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,400)  While his stat rankings of 65th in Bogey Avoidance and 9th in BoB% would suggest he is very inconsistent that is far from the truth. He has made the cut in all seven tournaments this season with three Top 25's and Two Top 15 finishes.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

Webb finished T16 at the Players Championship and 5th at the Dean & Deluca Invitational last week, so should he keep trending in the right direction a win should be well within reach. In six starts at this course, Simpson has an 11th (2016), an 8th (2011) and a 48th (2009 debut) as well as three missed cuts. The way he is currently playing, the hope is that he comes here and plays nearer the level he was when 11th here last year and 8th in 2011.
Webb  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler at 22/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Bill Haas at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Marc Leishman at 66/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

He’s a great value at his price considering he has the 4th best Vegas odds but only the 7th most expensive player on the board. Mid Range Picks  Patrick Reed ($8,300)  Reed is absurdly underpriced. He’s a consistent cut-maker with a solid track record here.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

This is very similar to the form he had shown in his first two starts at the Byron Nelson and hopefully he can improve on the 13th place finish he managed there two starts ago. Finau is a player of immense quality and it is just a matter of time before he adds to his lone PGA Tour victory, that he landed in Puerto Rico last season. From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th).
Finau  ->  positive

Much like Chez Reavie with solid recent performances I would expect Bradley to be cash chalk and feel that this is well deserved. Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Because his short game is so good, he doesn’t have to contend with length off the tee as an obstacle. Reed could pop here; his problem is usually a lackluster Saturday. If he holds steady on Saturday, look out Sunday!
Reed  ->  positive

If there was a course made to fit Henley's game, it would be this one. Henley also ranks 8th in putting 15-25' and 2nd in Round 1 Scoring. John Huh ($6,500)  Huh comes into The Byron Nelson after missing two of last three cuts.
Henley's  ->  positive

Steals  Johnson Wagner ($7,700)  With harder pricing this week, I don’t think many people will target this range of golfers. If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play. Wagner is notorious for fast starts on Thursdays, and he was finally able to sustain that and post a top-5 finish last weekend.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

Despite struggling last week, Reed will be looking to build on the 6th place finish at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the Career Builder Challenge he has accumulated so far in 2017. Another notable in the field this week is Phil Mickelson who is a four-time Pebble Beach winner. Mickelson has not finished outside the top-21 so far this season and finished T16 in Phoenix last week.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Current Form  In Spieth’s six most recent tournaments, he has averaged a monster 103.92 PPT with an amazing +24.54 Plus/Minus and incredible 80 percent Consistency. Spieth’s 67.6 Recent Adjusted Round Score and 27.5 Recent Adjusted Putts Per Round are currently tied for ninth in the Masters field, and his 18.0 Recent Adjusted Birdie Average is tied for fourth. Spieth won the ATT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in mid-February and finished 12th his last time out at the WGC-Mexico Championship.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

Bill Haas ($9,500): Haas is coming in off a two-week rest and he needed it apparently as he missed the cut by a mile his last time out at the Heritage. Still, Haas has been consistent most of the season, with the RBC being his only missed cut over seven starts. With his recent third place at the WGC Match Play event still semi-fresh, I won’t be shocked if Haas puts the confidence gained there to good use this week in a much weaker field.
Haas  ->  positive

Another obvious pointer to his chances at Firestone is that the just-turned 40-year-old is ranked fifth for Par 4 Performance this year. Tied fifth at the Travelers on his last appearance Stateside, I'm hoping this is the week when a few more putts drop at crucial times and Casey is right there on the back nine in Sunday's final round. Finally, one at three-figure odds that enters my head is Kyle Stanley.
Casey  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. Webb Simpson is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Simpson’s 69.0 Course Adj Rd Score ranks first among golfers with more than two starts here and sixth overall.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

He's also 27th in SGT2G, T30 in ball striking, 37th in P4P. Chris Kirk - $8,200    Until a couple of weeks ago, this is not a pick we would've made and still may be a gamble. However, Kirk tied for 12th at The Players, giving him his first top-20 since November (yes, November).
Kirk  ->  positive

Last season, Smith was ranked eighth on the PGA Tour in putting average. Long-Shot Values    Bryson DeChambeau - $7,000 (60-1)    DeChambeau notched three top-20s in the fall season. He ranks 41st in proximity so far this season.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

7th (2013) and 1st at East Lake (2014) across an elite-class field also shows that Horschel likes the rigours of a Donald Ross test. Success here at Sedgefield had been limited with a 30th, 46th, 47th and a MC from 4 appearances until 12 months ago when Horschel off of the back of some indifferent non-Bermuda form, very reminiscent to what we are seeing from him at the moment, finished 5th. Naturally with a Floridian upbringing, this Bermudagrass narrative makes plenty of sense and in this season alone, Horschel has finished 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and 4th at TPC Southwind, with Bermudagrass making up 3 of his 4 top 5 finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

Time to rebound this week in the desert. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Hideki Matsuyama (T4-T2-WIN-WIN)  J.J. Spaun (T4)  Webb Simpson (6-for-7 with five top 15s)  Rickie Fowler (7-for-9 with three top 5s)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T9)  Byeong Hun An (6th)  Zach Johnson (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Shane Lowry (T6-T16)  Jon Rahm (T5-T16)  Brendan Steele (7-for-7 with five Top 20s)  Phil Mickelson (22-for-28 with THREE WINS)  Kevin Na (11-for-12 with eight top 30s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-8 with two top 10s)  Bubba Watson (9-for-11 with six top 15s)  Daniel Berger (T10-T58-T7)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Matt Kuchar  Justin Thomas  Phil Mickelson  Marc Leishman  Francesco Molinari  Brandt Snedeker  Austin Cook  Steve Stricker  Zach Johnson  Patrick Reed  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, and Daniel Berger.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

He’s a good value at the top of the board this week. Pat Perez ($8,000) – Ever since Pat Perez returned from his shoulder surgery when he “stayed sane by drinking a lot of booze and eating a lot of food,” he’s been a completely different player. Since his return, he has won two PGA events and jumped his way up to 19th in the world (he was ranked 118th at the end of 2016).
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Looking at past winners, Cook's game probably most resembles that of Jason Dufner so the evidence is right there that fairways and greens players can triumph here. Cook won the RSM on just his fourth start with a PGA Tour card so he's clearly got something about him. In fact, even before he got full playing privileges, the 26-year-old showed he had the game for this level.
Cook's  ->  positive

One from the Rough (Sleeper)  Hiroshi Iwata  He was in contention a few months ago at Pebble and almost captured his first PGA Tour win. After his big performance, Iwata registered back-to-back missed cuts, but his play is one that could be a great fit this week in Puerto Rico. 16th in strokes gained putting and  Remember him last year at the PGA?
Hiroshi Iwata  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 5 of the predictor are Webb Simpson, Ryan Moore, Chesson Hadley, Kevin Streelman and Tony Finau.

Jordan’s 72.2 percent Recent GIR is 16th, and his 17.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for fourth among golfers who have made more than two starts the past six weeks. Spieth also played well at the WGC events last season, finishing T7, T17, T9, and T3. The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance.
Jordan’s  ->  positive

1st for Greens in Regulation, 3rd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green and 6th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green at Kapalua carried on Brian's ball-striking prowess from the autumn. Tie that in with the fact that Harman has found the greens here to his liking on recent visits placing 3rd for Strokes Gained Putting last year and within the top 10 in 2016 and you can see that he has a real chance this week to deliver a much merited win. It's worth remembering that the St Simons Island resident won his maiden title with a -22/262 total at the 2014 John Deere Classic so low scoring is no chore and on a track where Greens in Regulation and Bogey Avoidance is critical, he currently sits 4th and 10th across both PGA Tour skill sets.
Harman  ->  positive

Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well.
Henley  ->  positive

I look at each player's last five events and average their finish positions. DJ had the one missed cut which brings that average just below Molinari's despite winning back to back events(not including Match Play). Molinari hasn't won but has been incredibly consistent with finishes of T22, T33, T7, T20 and T14 over his last five events and has made 10 of 11 cuts this season with three Top 10's and eight Top 25 finishes.
Molinari's  ->  positive

The 25-year-old's final-round 61 to win the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational by five shots on Sunday was an absolute masterclass and the confidence he gained from finishing runner-up in the last major on American soil - June's U.S. Open - would have jumped several more notches. Matsuyama has won two of the last four WGCs by big margins; now it's time to grab a major. Dustin Johnson had two World Golf Championship wins to his credit before making the big breakthrough with victory in last year's US Open so it's fair to see WGCs as a natural stepping stone to the majors.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Put it all together and lineups that are heavy on the chalk (raising my hand) are not as likely to contend for the weekly title as gamers who blend surprise contenders with strong games off the tee. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Waste Management Phoenix Open (in alphabetical order):  Tony Finau  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  Webb Simpson  Jordan Spieth  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks.

LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th. At best however if you catch Lucas on the right week, in tough conditions, with ball striking at a premium and a few putts drop, he is still a class act and can get right in the hunt and, as a three time winner on tour including a US Open, he does know how to win a golf tournament!
Glover.  ->  positive

He has missed his last two cuts and hasn’t played since the Travelers. There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood – $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan.
Day  ->  negative

His Masters play-off defeat came on the back of three missed cuts at Augusta and he went on to miss another in 2013, but since then Oosthuizen's form figures of 25-T19-T15 show encouraging progression and confirm that his near-miss was no flash-in-the-pan. Unlike Leishman and Fowler, he doesn't have a recent victory to call upon but Oosthuizen is a relaxed character who will recognise that third in Phoenix, fifth in Perth and a run of solid performances elsewhere, including at the Match Play, represents a perfectly solid preparation for the season's first major. Last year he drove the ball wonderfully well here, ranking ninth in distance and third in accuracy, and it's now three visits in four that he's found upwards of 65 percent of greens, twice leading the entire field in ball-striking, twice in total driving, and once in the all-around.
Leishman  ->  positive

Wait until he puts at least a couple good rounds under his belt. Jimmy Walker – $7,600  It’s very unfortunate to watch, but the decline of Jimmy Walker is tough to watch. He has now missed four straight cuts, and last week’s Sony Open might be the most eye opening.
Jimmy Walker  ->  negative

He has three WGC wins in his career. Johnson has the highest salary and best odds to win the tournament (13.3 percent) this week. DJ has played reasonably well in comparable spots:  In addition to producing a +6.0 Plus/Minus with 63.6 percent Consistency across the sample, he’s also scored at least 95 DraftKings points in six of eleven tournaments.
DJ  ->  positive

Pebble Beach is my favourite, that’s my favourite course ever, but this course is in awesome shape and like I said, the weather is, this is as good as it gets in golf.”  Hadley ticks some key statistical boxes here ranking 37th in GIR, sixth in SGTTG, 37th in SG putting, first in par 3 scoring, 38th in par 4 scoring and 27th in par 5 scoring.

Adam Hadwin;  ->  positive

You might want to try an avoid guys playing Spyglass on a rough day as it tends to be the most difficult and can really take a golfer out of the tournament. The Tiers  $12,000 - $10,000  CASH: He was our GPP play last week but this week for cash I am going straight to the top with Jordan Spieth. Spieth comes into Pebble with great form having posted a 9th last week after getting off to a rocky start was able to find his groove and surge on the weekend with two prior 3rd places in the fall.. Jordan's game is well suited for this event and he is sneaky long enough to hit the big par 5's in two.
Jordan  ->  positive

Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory.
Casey  ->  positive

He's got 10 million reasons to play well. Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017.
Spieth  ->  positive

That means that he can spend 100% of his time focusing on one thing and one thing alone, and I can imagine that he intends to do just that. The final point I’ll make about Stanley is that he’s been exceptional regardless of the difficulty of the stage. He showed up with a T6 at Muirfield, T4 at Sawgrass, T8 at the SHO, T17 at the API, and finished in the top 25 at the NTO, Dell, and Tour Championship.
Stanley  ->  positive

Last week's performance in Puerto Rico was a little disappointing in some respects, given that he'd put together successive top-25 finishes in much deeper fields previously, but it looks like Lee just didn't get anything going on the greens and it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. On his last start in this event, Lee missed the cut but a second-round 66 contained eight birdies and just one mistake, a costly double-bogey. Just two players in the field bettered his Friday score and he was very close to undoing the damage of round one.
Lee  ->  positive

Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000. Generally, I’d go a little further down the favorites list for this pick but I think Rahm has a legitimate chance to win this week. He already has a win and five top 25s in his first full season on Tour and ranks 5th in Shots Gained Off the Tee.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Will he just be turning up for a whack or could he shoot the lights out with no pressure on? Jordan Spieth - 11/2    Spieth won this by 10 shots when it was played at Isleworth in 2015, finishing 26 shots in front of last-placed Tiger. When defending at Albany, this week's venue, last year the two-time major winner shot rounds of 67-66-68-67 to finish solo fourth, five back from Bubba.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Besides which, if he makes the turn on Sunday in contention for a green jacket, I can't imagine that the prospect of reaching world number one will be anywhere near the front of his mind. Ultimately, I believe Thomas's play over the last year makes him the man to beat, and I expect him to improve on his Masters form and demonstrate that his is an ideal game for Augusta National. Should he do that, he won't be far away and nobody is as good at winning right now.
Thomas's  ->  positive

Greens in regulation will be a key stat here along with approaches, strokes gained putting, scrambling, par 4 and par 5 scoring. Jordan Spieth 7/1  I don’t know what it is about Augusta but it seems to really suit Jordan Spieth. Despite missing the cut last week in Houston, Spieth has been in great form with a win and five top 25’s in his last seven starts.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Great results across both Emirates Golf Club - 8th (2016), 3rd (2017) and 3rd (2018) and Crans-sur-Sierre - 3rd (2014), 3rd (2015) and 3rd (2017) tie in well with the last 2 winners here in Garcia and Willett, but I also like Hatton for his strong links with St Andrews as Augusta winners Tiger Woods, Zach Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia all have excellent records at the Home of Golf, as does 2016 champion Danny Willett. So getting on board the 2016 and 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links winner Hatton makes lots of sense to me at a rather tasty price. Hatton is currently available at a market-leading 80/1 with Ladbrokes if you prefer .
Hatton  ->  positive

Spieth needs a win and some help to win the FedEx Cup, and while he may have had a “disappointing” season by his standards, it wouldn’t surprise me to see him repeat come Sunday night. Mid Tier  Paul Casey (9,500)  Casey is the one who has played himself into a top 5 spot by finishing runner-up in the last 2 Playoff events. Casey has only played East Lake twice, finishing 4th and 5th.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Jimmy Walker ($6,500)  Let’s be honest, in an 18-man field there’s not really any “sleeper” picks. Still, I do think Jimmy Walker could go under the radar due to his poor recent form. Walker has had a strange if not marvelous 2016.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

He’s a great value at this price. Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential.
Rahm  ->  positive

Especially with the softer pricing on FanDuel, you can easily afford Rahm and still make a great cash game team. Ownership in GPP’s will be the question to figure out in deciding if you want to be overweight or underweight on Rahm and we have you covered here at dfsarmy.com with our research station ownership projections for VIP members. Chez Reavie – All Formats – DK: $8800 FD: $9400  Reavie continued his string of recent performances with a T18 last week at the Sony Open.
Rahm  ->  positive

If he can just roll it at an average pace, like he did at this track last year, the reigning Masters champ will be near the top of the leaderboard. Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly.
Finau  ->  positive

Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Russell Knox.  ->  positive

Since he's a long hitter, his scoring stats are strong on par 4s and par 5s. His birdie average of 3.89 per round is strong, especially considering his price point, and unless he ends up with Dustin Johnson, Rahm or Justin Thomas, he'll be have a great opportunity to upset a bracket. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks (for the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship)  Eric Axley  There are events each year where the field is a little bit weak, and then there are fields that are just barely above what we would see at a Web.com Tour event with not even enough names at the top to have big favorites overall.
Rahm  ->  positive

Harold Varner III ($6300): To afford a player like Jon Rahm, it’s necessary to squeeze in one of the cheaper players with upside, and Varner fits that to a tee. Although he’s not currently the longest hitter on Tour, Varner sits T45 in Carry Distance and in the past has been known for his distance. The “Dab King” averages 3.74 birdies and converts birdie or better on 16.03% of approach shots between 150-175 yards.
Varner  ->  positive

Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
Walker  ->  positive

Guys I might not have on DraftKings but bet them because I like their odds: NICK TAYLOR (585/1) and CHEZ REAVIE (450/1). ⛳️
CHEZ REAVIE  ->  positive

Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
Furyk  ->  positive

All three of these guys are typically mid to upper 7k range. Hadwin hasn’t been “stellar” but seems to always make the cut. Lee and Taylor have been a bit hotter lately and I like their birdie potential.
Hadwin  ->  positive

All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays. In terms of correlating course form, Simpson has results everywhere you want to see them and it's also good to see that he has excellent Champion Bermudagrass results across both TPC Southwind (3rd 2014) and Sedgefield Country Club (5th 2014, 6th 2015, 3rd 2017). RESULT: T21  Tony Finau 1.5pts EW 45/1 with £/€20 risk-free bet* for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (8 EW, 1/5 odds):  Big names at the top of the betting have created bigger prices for some form players and I like the look of Tony Finau this week.
Simpson  ->  positive

A no-cut, limited field means that you need to find points and find points often. I’ll take you through some viable cash options as we open up the season:  Russell Henley, 7800: Henley hasn’t played here since 2015 and that included a T3 showing, but had been playing well towards the end of last season with a third place finish at the Tour Championship. Henley sits fifth in SG Approach and tenth in DK points in his last eight rounds at Kapalau.
Henley,  ->  positive

Can’t make this stuff up. Still, despite bleeding strokes to the field on the putting surfaces in four of his past six starts, List has piled up six consecutive Top 30s, with two Top-10 paydays. It’s about getting to the green for List.
List  ->  positive

He is a four-time PGA Tour winner that hasn't won since the 2007 Viking Classic but is playing some of his best golf of this season right now. Since missing the cut at the PLAYERS, Campbell has made the weekend in five of his last six tournaments with four Top 25 finishes. He also ranks 13th on my sheet in average DK points over his last five tournaments.
Campbell  ->  positive

With a relatively weak field, this could be Cantlay's platform to shine. The gamble in this group is Hadwin, who took the tour by storm in the early parts of 2017 with a win, four top-10s and a 59, yet has been a non-entity as of late (missing three of his past five cuts). However, he does have two top-10s at this event, including a T-7 at Glen Abbey in 2015.
Hadwin,  ->  positive

Walker endured a 36-hole finale at Baltusrol, shooting 68-67 on the final day to hold off Jason Day’s late charge and win his first major title. Walker’s starting to hit peak form ahead of this week’s PGA Championship, racking up top-30 finishes in two of his last three starts. He even held the 36-hole lead at Firestone last week before settling for a 28th-place finish at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational.
Walker’s  ->  positive

He was eighth on tour in scrambling last season. Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013.
Watson  ->  positive

The final hole is a tough par four (second toughest the last two years) so a par is by no means a given there. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth heads the market and rightly so. After a somewhat subdued 2016, he's started 2017 well and he was a big eye-catcher at the Sony Open, where he ranked first for Greens In Regulation when finishing third behind his good friend, Justin Thomas.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

T13 finishes at both the RSM Classic and the Sony Open earlier on this season prove he likes these short, wind-affected courses and hopefully he will continue his form on a similar layout this week. Last season, List’s two best finishes of the season came at the CareerBuilder Challenge (T6), where two of the three courses are Pete Dye designs and the Honda Classic (T10) which is also well known for its windy conditions. If List is going to get off the mark on the PGA Tour anytime soon, he is going to want to ride these patches of form he is going through, and he can go again after that T3 finish two weeks ago.
List’s  ->  positive

That solid core of play both with tee shots and approach shots is magnified on the basis that East Lake always ranks in the top 15 or so for scrambling difficulty on the PGA Tour. Winners : 2016: Rory McIlroy (-12); 2015: Jordan Spieth (-9); 2014: Billy Horschel (-11); 2013: Henrik Stenson (-13); 2012: Brandt Snedeker (-10); 2011: Bill Haas (-9); 2010: Jim Furyk (-8). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Selection    Marc Leishman could only finish 28th on his only previous appearance at East Lake - back in 2009 - but I'm happy to ignore that given the positive stats for BMW winners and given how well he's playing. Had DJ gone on to win last year, four of the ten BMW winners would have doubled up here and Leishman reminds me of two of the three winners that have doubled up since the tournament became the FedEx Cup finale...    Villegas had form figures reading 21-3-1 before doubling up here in 2008 and Horschel's read MC-2-1 in 2014. Leishman's read MC-3-1 and he has a similar profile to the other too as well.
Leishman  ->  positive

Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

Fowler has had a lot of time to think about missing a prime chance at the U.S. Open, and we should see where his head is at first thing on Thursday. That said, Fowler checks off all the boxes: 11th in SG: Tee-to-Green, seventh in SG: Putting and first in scrambling. He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance.
Fowler  ->  positive

This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Johnson  ->  positive

He’s a good min-price punt this week. Others: Robert Garrigus  High-upside GPP Picks  Bubba Watson ($9,400): Watson has picked up the pace a bit over his couple of starts and comes in off the back of three straight made cuts and a T27 at last weeks Open. It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well.
Bubba  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel: Bill Haas ($10,500)  Fantasy folks should keep a close eye on Jamie Lovemark and Charles Howell III after their top-10s last week, but the pick here is Haas, who's coming off a T-13 of his own. The winner in the desert in both 2010 and 2015, he obviously not only knows his way around these courses, but even as a quick player owns the patience necessary to play his best golf in the midst of a pro-am format.
Haas  ->  positive

While he hasn’t registered a win on the year, a T5 at the U.S. Open and top-five placings at both the WGC China event and the WGC Match Play are definitely worth noting. Haas has played Firestone seven times over his career, and he has two finishes inside the top 20, with his career best being a T7 back in 2013. It’s worth noting, however, that Haas does seem to set up well for the course based on his season-long stats which include ranking sixth in Par 4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards and also being inside the top-10 in Bogey Avoidance.
Haas  ->  positive

I really like how he sets up, considering he's a known plodder and this course demands patience from start to finish. Jason Rouslin -- Luke Donald ($7,500)  A guy that might be peaking at the right time, Donald enters The Barclays coming off of a second-place finish at the Wyndham. This week he returns to Bethpage where he found success in 2012, coming in 10th.
Donald  ->  positive

Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Brendan  ->  positive

Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure. (Note: It is worth following how Day says his back is feeling prior to Thursday.)
Day  ->  positive

He’s been money for fantasy over the past month or so and I see no reason to hop off at what is still a decent price. Others: Tony Finau, Justin Thomas  Values  Anirban Lahiri ($7,500): Lahiri is coming off a monster performance at the Memorial where he demolished the course in his final round with a bogey free seven under; gaining five strokes over the field on approaches alone in that round. This will be his first time seeing TPC River Highlands but the fact he ranks 9th in Birdie or Better percentage and 16th in par 4 Birdie or Better Percentage means he should be taken seriously in DFS this week.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

Bonus  Pro Trends: 13, Adam Scott ($10,100)  Scott currently leads all players in the field with 13 Pro Trends, one of which is a Rec GIR of at least 75. Scott’s 29.9 PPR average through his last three events is atrocious, but it is only 0.1 PPR more than his LT average. He excels by being one of the best ball strikers in the game, and right now his Rec GIR of 78.2 percent shows that he has been getting it done recently.
Scott  ->  positive

($7,200) four straight made cuts, ninth in SG: Around the Green. Brian Gay ($7,100) former winner, 16th in SG: Around the Green. ($7,100) former winner, 16th in SG: Around the Green.

Paul Casey's  ->  positive

Given that he probably putts best on bermuda greens and has shown definite improvement across the last two FedEx Cup events, Garcia is both playing well enough and suitably under-the-radar to put his experience to use at a course which is always capable of catching out the fearless aggression of youth. Since his last start here in 2014, Garcia has really stepped up a level and he's been winning in high-class company. The players who've finished second to him this season are both major champions, while the player he beat in a play-off for last year's PGA Tour win has since become one.
Garcia  ->  positive

He has also been good here at the Houston Open with made cuts in four of his last five events including a T15 last year, T5 in 2015, and T10 in 2013. Emiliano Grillo  World Golf Ranking (#75)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,500)  FanDuel ($9,000)  Grillo is coming off a disappointing T50 last in Puntacana when he was priced as a Top 3 player and expected to be on the final page of the leaderboard on Sunday. That alone will help with the ownership this week in GPP formats but I also trust him in cash games as well.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

He started 2017 fairly slowly but I really like the fact he was in contention at the Farmers a few weeks ago, a course he’d never challenged at previously. Casey brings great course history to this event and also a tee to green game which is amoung the best in the world right now. He’s my favorite from the 8k range which is littered with great players.
Casey  ->  positive

Will he just be turning up for a whack or could he shoot the lights out with no pressure on? Jordan Spieth - 11/2    Spieth won this by 10 shots when it was played at Isleworth in 2015, finishing 26 shots in front of last-placed Tiger. When defending at Albany, this week's venue, last year the two-time major winner shot rounds of 67-66-68-67 to finish solo fourth, five back from Bubba.
Spieth  ->  positive

RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
RORY  ->  negative

I think Patrick Reed is a great bet at 60/1. Course History and extreme recent form being overvalued by the books.… https://t.co/TbrLwKNofc
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Travelers Championship - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Bubba Watson 1.5pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Bubba Watson makes a lot of sense this week and with Day, McIlroy and Spieth all in the field, it's great to see 33/1 about the 2-time Travelers champion. Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner.
Bubba  ->  positive

In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

1 in Presidents Cup standings Hideki Matsuyama has won the @WGC_Bridgestone! pic.twitter.com/FLmvnZEbaX — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) 6 August 2017  He’s 12/1 to become Japan’s first major winner and, in his current, focused, zen-like state, I think Matsuyama won’t be stopped. In fact, the only thing that might cause him any confusion next Sunday is if Paul McCartney presents the trophy.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

McGirt is lso T31 in total driving, 16th in GIR and eighth in scrambling. Emiliano Grillo … This member of the famed “Class of 2011” hasn't so much been forgotten as overshadowed by his brethren, even though he hasn't missed any of the big events since capturing the Rookie of the Year award in 2015-16. However, and suddenly it seems, he's in the last year of the exemption for winning the Safeway Open to launch that season, as well as measurably outside the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking (currently 73rd) and eligible for only one major (Open Championship) and one WGC (Bridgestone) at the moment.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

Last four events: 43-14-37-MC  Course form: 11-MC-12-5-38-27-38  Last 10 majors: 5-22-5-11-33-46-MC-MC-30-30  Last 50 starts - Win: 2%, Top 5: 22%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  I couldn't quite pull the trigger on Justin Rose in the outright market but I have no hesitation making him my best top 10 punt here. Rose has the most robust greens in regulation stats at Augusta National of any player in the field this week and that will get you the top 10s. He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another.
Rose  ->  positive

Statistically he's perfect for me this week and after shooting -5/67 on Sunday at Augusta to finish a career-best 20th, he's arriving with momentum. Result: T5  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £/€20 risk-free bet** for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 EW, 1/5 odds):  I will close with Ryan Moore who I think will be the kind of plotter who could thrive at Harbour Town. A player who's traditionally gone from Augusta direct to Quail Hollow in terms of schedule, Ryan now finds himself outside of the OWGR top 50 and needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Open.
Ryan  ->  positive

The Korean was T49 on debut here last year. Final Bet: Back Sam Saunders EW @ 125/1  At the top of the market, Jordan Spieth is a former winner but his build towards Augusta is rather a slow one and form of 14-9-20 in his last three starts is more that of a fine player in good form rather than the elite performer we know him to be. Valspar first-timer Rory McIlroy has been underwhelming since his fast start to the year in the Middle East and I've probably run out of patience with Paul Casey for the time being in the outright market.
Sam Saunders  ->  positive

We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice. Casey has played Augusta well the last 2 years finishing 4th and 6th.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Spieth has struggled off the tee this year, but leads the field in Strokes Gained: Approach and is 5th in Par 3 Birdie or Better so far this year. Most DraftKings players will have to make a decision between Spieth and Johnson. Spieth is the better cash game play this week in my opinion.
Spieth  ->  positive

Consensus #HondaClassic Futures Berger +4500 Scott +5000 Henley +5000 Bradley +9000 Going for our 4th outright win of 2018! #BetGolf
Berger  ->  positive

Graham DeLaet ($8,400) – Don’t look now, but DeLaet is starting to regain his PGA Tour relevance at a very rapid pace. With top 20 finishes at Phoenix, Riviera, and PGA National, DeLaet is clearly returning to form as one of the best ball strikers in the game, even if his scrambling and putting still aren’t quite up to snuff. He’s a great value this week.
DeLaet  ->  positive

Watney made the cut in his first event back at the Safeway a few weeks ago and arrives this week at a course where he has tremendous history, making six straight cuts with five finishes in the top 16. Jason Rouslin -- Ben Martin ($7,600)  Martin will look to have a soild start to his 2016-2017 season and make it all the way to the Tour Championship after he was knocked out at the BMW last season. He comes off the Sanderson where he placed 18th, and comes back to TPC Sumerlin where he won in 2014.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

All in all though he’s not for me at the price, and I shall continue to watch his progress as a fascinated bystander. So on to this week’s picks and it’s five for me as follows;  JUSTIN ROSE – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 3rd  I shall say straight of the bat that I’m not really looking to reinvent the wheel with my picks this week and first up for me is Justin Rose. The case for Rose is a pretty obvious one this week and one thing Tiger’s presence at the top of the market does do is create a more than fair e/w price for the Englishman.
Rose.  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
Tommy  ->  positive

It’s also a Pete Dye course design so fire up the typical plodders and target practice golfers >> Donald, Duke, Furyk, Casey, etc…(sadly, no Kuch or Haas this week). Key Stats:  SG: Approach  SG: Off the Tee  Par 4 Scoring  GIR+  Birdie or Better %/Bogey Avoidance  Key Draftkings Targets:  Jordan Spieth 11.4k  Paul Casey 9.7k  Marc Leishman 9.3k  Tony Finau 8.7k  Kyle Stanley 8.6k  Charley Hoffman 7.3k  Webb Simpson 6.9k  Outright Bets:  Patrick Reed 28/1  Brendan Steele 33/1  Bubba Watson 35/1  Bud Cauley 45/1  Kyle Stanley 45/1  Jaime Lovemark 80/1  Kevin Tway 80/1  U.S. OPEN RECAP  Well, it wasn’t the 6/6 I was hoping for but those were few and far between and as you can see my 4/6 still managed to cash for $1,000 in the $333 Club Pro. Normally, I play my single bullet/top LU but I was feeling pretty good so stepped it up.
Casey,  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler 22/1  Granted, this one is a bit of a risk but I think it’s one worth taking on Rickie Fowler here. Fowler is playing decent golf lately and as I mentioned in my preview last week, he got the psychological relief of a win in Florida a couple of weeks ago at the Honda Classic which takes some of the pressure off a bit. He has been in good form so far this year with a T3 at the Hero World Challenge, T4 in Phoenix, T16 at the WGC Mexico, solo 12th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and a T3 last week in Houston.
Fowler  ->  positive

Again, with lower ownership, you are not going to need much exposure to be overweight on the field. $6K-$7K Range  Both Zach Johnson and Kevin Chappell will be 15%+ in GPP's this week at $7,700 on DraftKings. I am leaning Zach Johnson as he comes back to TPC Scottsdale with excellent course history with Top 15 finishes in three straight years and has been very consistent so far this year.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

All of this is valid. Thomas does have to prove he can contend at Augusta, whereas every other player right at the front of this market has done so once or more already. It's this which is keeping him from the front of the win-only market, because on a golf course which we could reasonably describe as a level playing field, he would certainly not be as big as 15.0; in fact he'd probably be favourite.
Thomas  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner – Sizzling after his win at Colonial and T-6 at Memorial, Kisner’s proven that he doesn’t mind a bit of Bentgrass on the greens. He’s Rickie Fowler “light”, and that’s meant as a compliment as he checks in fifth in SG: Total and registers in the top 40 of the major statistical categories. He’s absolutely solid through the entire bag.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year. Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches.
Morgan Hoffmann  ->  positive

Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
Flores  ->  positive

Lock and load. Adam Hadwin ($9,100) – Seriously, how long can we ride the Hadwin train. I am not hopping off as he is playing the golf of his life.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price. The American already has on his CV a win in a top-class field on the California coast.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
Walker  ->  positive

-- Jeff Bergerson  Tony Finau  Finau grades out very well for the Farmers Insurance Open, with his long game obviously a great fit on both courses. From a course history perspective, Finau has finishes of T-24, T-18 and T-4 from 2015 to 2017 (in that order), and he enters the week off five-straight made cuts in the 2018 season with a second-place finish at the Safeway and a T-32 at the Sony Open. In 2017, he was one of the best players on tour off the tee and in approach play while dominating with the long irons, posting a combined -82 relative to par from outside 175 yards.
Finau  ->  positive

Golf Card: Rose (-105) over Rory E/W Career Builder Sneds 35/1 Knox 40/1 Chappell 40/1 Piercy 80/1 Only Tuesday… https://t.co/rdOWWq7C59
Piercy  ->  positive

He does not play at Quail Hollow every year, but in the starts he has made he has yielded some good results. Johnson finished 14th here in 2014 after the changes were made to the greens and before that had finished 6th in 2011 and 11th in 2009. The changes made this week don’t play into Johnson’s hands, with the course being lengthened but as we know Johnsons is capable of winning and contending at courses that appear too long for him.
Johnson  ->  positive

Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun. As Kisner took Jim Furyk all the way having never before had a serious chance to win at this level, what his coach said suddenly made sense.
Kevin Kisner,  ->  positive

Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
McIlroy  ->  negative

At 36, whilst he is no spring chicken, he still has ten or more years ahead of him if he can find add some consistency to his game. James Hahn 200/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  James Hahn is another player of top quality, even if he to struggles with consistency. Hahn beat two top-class opponents, in Dustin Johnson and Paul Casey in a play-off at Riviera in 2015, and also got the better of Roberto Castro at the 2016 Wells Fargo Championship.
James Hahn  ->  positive

Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week. Marc Leishman, $17,600    Coming off a strong last season, Leishman hasn’t skipped a beat as he was runner-up at the CJ Cup and a disappointing tie for seventh last week after leading through 36 holes. The Aussie has plenty of great history at Waialae to back up his form too: 8-of-8 made cuts with two top 10s.
Leishman,  ->  positive

The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner. The aforementioned partner, Daniel Berger, is an excellent scrambler (24th) if the pairing struggle on approach, and himself is an excellent putter.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

He adds: "I love this golf course and had a pretty good record here, a lot of solid rounds." Dufner has done well in a couple of birdie fests but overall he much prefers something harder. Speaking in January, he said: "I play pretty well on tougher golf courses, usually that kind of 6- to 10-under range is a good number for me (he won the USPGA with 10-under)."
Dufner  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  MY PICK : Louis Oosthuzien ($9,100)  Oosthuizen started the playoffs strong last week with a T10. While he was somewhat wild off the tee at Glen Oaks, Oosthuizen’s approach game was on point as he gained over 4.2 strokes on the field in approaches and was T3 for the week in Greens in Regulation. The South African has come close to winning multiple times this year in strong field events, and the venue this week clearly speaks to him as he’s landed finishes of T12-T8-T2 at TPC Boston over his last three appearances – a record which includes six of his last 12 rounds being 67 or better.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory. The weakest part of Finau’s game is accuracy off of the tee; according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, we can see it is the only category he significantly loses stroked to the field in. However with very wide fairways that weakness is mitigated greatly.
Finau’s  ->  positive

Here are my selections for the 2017 BMW Championship. Justin Rose 33/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Justin Rose has not had the best of season’s by his own high standards, but it is important to remember the Englishman was runner-up to Sergio Garcia at the Masters back in April and has contended again since as well. Since Augusta, a couple of missed cuts and three finishes of T54 or worse have clouded the year for Rose.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.
Reed.  ->  positive

He trails only Matsuyama and Chez Reavie with his 19.5 Recent Birdie Average. Ross Fisher: I’ll leave some really contrarian picks for Kelly’s Five Under Five piece on Wednesday, but I do want to highlight Fisher, who is currently projected at just five to eight percent ownership. He’s an excellent play — his 304.6-yard Recent DD is good enough, and he came in 10th last time he played Quail Hollow — and non-PGA members could be undervalued.
Fisher:  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm? Cantlay’s LT Adj Rd Score (68.5) is tied for fifth, while his LT GIR percentage (69.7) is tied for 16th and LT Adj Bird Avg (15.4) ranks seventh.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

This brings us to Luke Donald at the RBC Heritage. For one, as rapidly as you want to connect dots between fellow 40somethings/Englishmen Paul Casey and Ian Poulter, both of whom recent winners of PGA TOUR events, and even World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship winner Phil Mickelson, also a contemporary, none of them possessed the kind of epic course history at the sites of their titles as Donald has at Harbour Town Golf Links. It's a relevant narrative to carry a casual conversation, but it's an improper fantasy angle.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

The Hero World Challenge 2017  Lock of the week:  Embed from Getty Images  Justin Rose – $8,600 – It would be wise of you to lock in the only guy in the field with his primary residence being in the Bahamas. Insert Justin Rose. Rose has two wins, a T4, and a T10 in his last four starts since late October.
Rose  ->  positive

When you look at his stats and course history, you can see why. Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016.
Woodland  ->  positive

Mori Yoshimoto  @Bears3423    Last Week: 348.5 points  Last Week Rank: 5,177    Kevin Na ($29,500)  William McGirt ($29,000)  Lucas Glover ($15,700)  Kyle Stanley ($12,200)  Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)  John Peterson ($4,300)    ANALYSIS: Ball-striking is the name of the game here for Mo. If Valspar proves to be a worthy pointer like it often does than Cantlay's runner-up finish there looks even better. Yahoo!
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He’s missed the cut the last to years at this place. Aside from Kapalua, Thomas has been playing well. But this course doesn’t seem to fit him and it’s tough not to be weary of a streaky guy on a track that hasn’t suited him.
Thomas  ->  negative

Rapidly 75th in the Official World Golf Ranking, he's making his first appearance on the PGA TOUR. Dean Burmester … There has to be some bittersweetness to his appearance this week. See, if he didn't qualify, his other option would be to defend his title at the Tshwane Open in his native South Africa.
Dean Burmester  ->  positive

He sprays it off the tee without much distance, and the best part of his game is his scrambling and putting. Webb Simpson ($8,200)  Simpson is perhaps a perfect pivot off of Reed at this price because statistically he’s exactly what you’re looking for here. His approach game- especially out of the rough- is top tier and his entire tee to green game is solid.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Despite limited opportunities and five missed cuts in his last six starts he still ranks 39th on tour for ball-striking and should enjoy this week’s test. Schauffele made the cut at the OHL Classic and a second round 63 was very encouraging. He also finished T5 at the Sanderson Farms Championship so there are plenty of positives if you go far enough back.
Schauffele  ->  positive

He had a good week at the Masters in Augusta finishing T9 and followed that with a T6 at The Players Championship shooting rounds of 70,72,71,70 to post five under par in total. Scott has had some good performances on tricky courses this year including a T11 in Riviera at the Genesis Open and T14 at The Honda at the end of February. Scott has only played here once before finishing seventh in 2007 and also ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 17th in driving distance, 12th in birdie average and 293rd in par 4 birdie or better leaders.
Scott  ->  positive

He is one of just six golfers in the entire field that rank Top 20 in my stats model, five-year course history ranks and current form ranks. After missing the cut at the Masters in 2010 and then again in 2012, Casey didn't play the following two years. He returned in a big way the past two years with finishes of T6 and T4 and is poised for another strong finish this year.
Casey  ->  positive

As of midday Wednesday, he's way out front in ownership percentage at 20 percent. That's eight clicks better than Luke List in second and 14 points clear of both Sergio Garcia and Brendan Steele. Surely, there are options.
Luke List  ->  positive

Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
Fowler  ->  positive

McGirt also covers the Riviera base - he was sixth there in 2014, 14th in 2015 and 20th in 2016 - but this shorter par 70 is even better for his game and at 110/1, he looks the standout each-way bet. Kevin Na is another short hitter who should benefit for the drop in trip of around 1,000 yards after a respectable T32 in the US Open. Na was the subject of much discussion after bemoaning the length of the rough at Erin Hills, but once the talking was over he outperformed even his own expectations with three solid rounds, none more so than an opening 68.
Na  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – Wyndham Championship  Lock of the week:  Kevin Kisner – $11,300 –Kiz is the type of guy that will take a crappy Sunday like the one he had at the PGA Championship and turn it into pure fire the next week. He’s going to be eager to get out there and prove himself after his tough final round of 74. The former University of Georgia Bulldog ranks high in the field in three key stats for us this week; Good Drives: Gained, Par 4 Scoring, & DraftKings scoring.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Spieth’s lacklustre figures in Putting and Off the Tee are slightly negated by his hugely impressive Approach-the-Green (1st) and Tee-to-Green (10th) numbers. Spieth also ranks 4th in Par 5 Scoring Average which may well come into play at this Par 72 track. Another pleasing statistic is that he ranks T4 in Par 4 Birdies or Better, so even during a “lull in form” Spieth still ranks highly in a lot of key areas.
Spieth  ->  positive

In two previous starts at PGA National he has finished 17th or better. -- Zach Turcotte  Brian Gay  Between his poor course history and not being a household name, Gay is going to be off most people's radar this week. Couple those things with a missed cut at last week's Genesis Open, and you might think I'm crazy.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

Moreover, he has made nine straight cuts and has seven top-25 finishes during that stretch. Adam Hadwin: Hadwin has only played here twice, but he hasn’t finished worse than 22nd in either appearance. Hadwin’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score is 10th, his 60.6 LT SC percentage is 19th, and his 14.4 LT Adj Bird Avg ranks ninth in the field.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

He has played very well around here before finishing T2 last year, T18 in 2015 and T9 in 2014. Staswise Knox ranks 10th in driving accuracy which is a plus around here. If he starts well the Scot could regain some of that early season form on a course that clearly suits his eye.
Knox  ->  positive

Throwing Darts  Charl Schwartzel: $7,600  32nd in strokes gained: approach-the-green. 37th in strokes gained: total, Schwartzel is a quality play at the $7,600 price point. He wasn't in the field at Conway Farms in 2013 or 2015, but T29 and T25 finishes in the first two Playoff Events are indicative of good form.
Charl Schwartzel:  ->  positive

Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again. A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

That may hurt him in a lot of places, but not at PGA National. Fowler's win last year was his third top-10 in this event, and he has two other top-25s. Justin Thomas - $11,300 (10-1)  Thomas has played six tournaments in 2017-28 and all six have resulted in top-25s.
Fowler's  ->  positive

Plus, he loves Riviera, with six top 10s in nine starts. Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
Dustin Johnson.  ->  positive

Spaun ($6,700) – T21  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,500) – T4  Thomas Pieters ($7,700) – MC  Daniel Berger ($8,900) – MC  So let’s just start by saying that up until Sunday, PGA National played about as easy as the tournament directors can set it up, which means that there is reasonable cause for concern regarding guys who blew the cut by more than a shot or two, starting with the usually-consistent Russell Knox. Although he wasn’t necessarily cheap, $9K seemed like a pretty good bargain for a guy who has a sterling track record at this event and simply could not set up much better for the course even from a theoretical level where ball-striking is an absolute essential.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Stanley has played the Bridgestone only once before, but he did well, tying for 16th in 2012. Brendan Steele - $6,700 (125-1)    Steele surely has cooled off from earlier in the season, in part because he's cut down on his schedule. But he was top-15 at the U.S. Open and followed that up with another top-15 the next week at the Travelers.
Steele  ->  positive

Knox’ experience is invaluable and Thomas has again enlisted his help, ahead of his second Masters start. Jimmy Johnson, Thomas’ caddie also believes the now 4-time PGA Tour winner is in much better shape this time around. Johnson, speaking of Thomas said “He won those (three) tournaments by having patience.
Thomas  ->  positive

According to our Trends tool, golfers with a LT Adjusted Bird Avg of at least 16.5 have manufactured an +8.74 Plus/Minus at Augusta National. Birdies are good: McIlroy’s ability to string together birdies will help him achieve the Streak Bonus in FanDuel’s scoring system and has helped him average a second-best 88.7 PPT on DraftKings the past 12 months. McIlroy’s 308.3-yard LT Driving Distance ranks third, and he’s one of just eight golfers in the field with an average of at least 305 yards.
McIlroy’s  ->  positive

That missed cut last year was just his third in 24 appearances at Augusta and as such I believe it was almost an anomaly. Before his lacklustre effort in a weather-affected, Shell Houston Open last week, Mickelson was in fine form, making it to the quarter-finals of the Match Play (his tied best performance in the event) after finishing T7 at the WGC – Mexico Championship. I am more than happy to overlook the finish last week, purely because I see last week as a tune-up for Phil, rather than him going for the win.
Phil,  ->  positive

He's a past champion here, a Texas native, and a Lone Star State specialist. In addition to his win in 2015, Walker has posted 3rd, 13th, and 16th place finishes here at TPC San Antonio. Last we saw of Walker, he posted three straight rounds under par at Augusta to finish inside the top-20.
Walker  ->  positive

I'd expect the eventual semi-finalist to come from the bottom half of the quarter though and to that end I'm backing Patrick Reed to be the player to prevail. Opponents Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel have both been off the boil of late - the Chinese star has finished outside of the top-50 on each of his starts since winning in Dubai and the former Masters Champion hasn't managed a top-10 globally since June of last year - which leaves Jordan Spieth as Reed's biggest challenge. Of course Spieth is well capable of finding the putting form that saw him rise to the top of the world rankings back in 2015-2016, however the process changes he's been making with the flat stick are yet to bed in fully and that leaves the door open for an aggressive player like Patrick Reed to take full advantage.
Reed  ->  positive

Let's take a look at the last five year's winners and the scorecard before jumping into the fantasy approach. 2016 - Jim Herman(-15)  - Jim Herman(-15) 2015 - J.B. Holmes(-16)  - J.B. Holmes(-16) 2014 - Matt Jones(-15)  - Matt Jones(-15) 2013 - D.A. Points(-16)  - D.A.
J.B. Holmes(-16)  ->  positive

His performance last week at a claustrophobic Harbour Town set-up, which doesn't suit him in my mind, was also quietly impressive. 68-68 was good enough for 13th after 36 holes, but Schauffele ultimately needs a more open course where he can use his undoubted strengths. 16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor. : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week.
Henley  ->  positive

Taking advantage of the four easiest holes at Augusta is, as mentioned, really important and while par-five performance has long been something of an issue for Haas, there's evidence to suggest he's getting to grips with this particular set. Finally, for one at such a price and without a major in the bag, Haas does have a heck of a lot of top-level form including his 2011 FedEx Cup success, which came here in Georgia, and three Presidents Cup appearances which he's desperate to add to with a fourth at Liberty National later this year. He's also won at Riviera and Congressional, two classical layouts with more than a passing resemblance to Augusta and form ties too, and I'm increasingly sweet on the idea that Haas could follow his great-uncle Bob Goalby and win the Masters.
Haas,  ->  positive

Mastsuyama has been great at Riviera too: In three career starts he has never finished outside the top 25 and has posted 11th- and fourth-place finishes the past two years. Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice.
Johnson  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan – DK: $6800 FD: $5200  He is not much of a birdie maker but Bryan is underpriced based on ability and is a sneaky course fit. In his short PGA career, Bryan has found success on short, easy golf courses. His win at the RBC Heritage came at a par 71, 7081-yard course.
Bryan  ->  positive

6 cuts made in a row here. Kevin Chappell $7,700 – He has really weird course history. MC 26th MC 23rd MC 24th MC.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

The youngster admitted they didn't have their best stuff but it was still a strong performance. For Fowler, it follows on from T6 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China a month ago. Adding to his credentials is his third place here at Albany 12 months ago where he shot 65-64 on the weekend.
Fowler,  ->  positive

-- At 50-to-1, this horse-for-course pick also had a very strong showing at the WGC-Match Play. Longshot: Cameron Tringale -- We don't typically dig this deep, but at 150-to-1, Tringale is worth a few quid, particularly on an each-way bet, given his track record in this tournament. 2017 Shell Houston Open betting odds
Tringale  ->  positive

Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
Padraig Harrington’s  ->  negative

His averages are hurt by last year’s 75.5-point DraftKings performance in which he yielded an ugly -4.92 Plus/Minus. Spieth: Masters Report  Per our Trends tool, in the two years prior to 2016 McIlroy averaged 89.25 PPT and a +4.87 Plus/Minus with 100 percent Consistency. He was a beast in 2015, racking up 105.5 points and a +7.64 Plus/Minus.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Although he won’t go under the radar in terms of ownership (by any stretch), it’s important to reiterate his talents that translate to this course:  1 st in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach T1 in Bogey Avoidance  2 nd in Birdie or Better %  in Birdie or Better % 5th in Par-4 Scoring  Although the flat stick hasn’t been up to his typical world-beating standards, Spieth still sits 31st in SG: Putting, and his poor ranking for putts made inside 10-15’ is easily explained by small sample size. Just like Thomas, with the driver out of his hand this week, Spieth has a great opportunity to win just on approach alone. The Fade  Just a small note here – I play one lineup, so every week I’m fading the full field minus six, just by virtue of only using one lineup.
Spieth  ->  positive

Steve Bamford's Tips for the 2018 Farmers Insurance Open . Follow Steve on twitter: @bamfordgolf  Tommy Fleetwood and Jon Rahm produced wins last week at 22/1 and 10/1 respectively. Both victories were ominously impressive, with Fleetwood moving to World Number 12 after successfully defending his Abu Dhabi title and delivering another great winner for our European Tour previewer Paul Williams.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title. With a T4 finish on his most recent start here, as well as some decent finishes under his belt this season, I thought Piller was worth a bet at a big price, in the hope he can find a win the top-level, for the first time.
Piller  ->  positive

He cited allergies as the cause of his withdrawal then rolled up at Augusta next time out and won the US Masters for a second time. As is typical with the wildly unpredictable Bubba, there have also been three missed cuts here but there have also been renewals in which Watson has shown that he has exactly the right game for the venue. In ten previous visits, his best finishes are an eighth ten years ago and a fourth in 2012 and he's sat inside the top-seven places after round one on three previous occasions.
Watson  ->  positive

Brian Harman  ->  positive

The 2011 winner, Charl Schwartzel, hadn't been in stellar really recent form but he'd won on the European Tour three months before he won the Masters. Bubba Watson had finished second at the WGC-Cadillac Championship (now the WGC-Mexico Championship) and fourth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational before he won the first of his two titles in 2012. Adam Scott had been third in the WGC-Cadillac in his penultimate start before his 2013 victory.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Whilst Koepka wasn’t a surprise winner, it was still his maiden win and as a result three of the last five winners have also been first-time PGA Tour winners. Kevin Stadler (2014) and Kyle Stanley (2012) also got their maiden PGA Tour wins at this venue in the last five renewals. Stanley especially, showed great character in the year of his win, bouncing back from a disappointing collapse at the Farmers Insurance Open just one week prior to his win here.
Stanley  ->  positive

More on the Euros below but, as for the other Americans, Rickie Fowler was 18/1 when winning last year so the 15/2 for a defence looks grim. Justin Thomas has curious course form of MC-3-MC but the middle one shows that he can tame this track and the US PGA champ has to rank as a big threat after showing some good signs when T9 at Riviera on Sunday. Gary Woodland is very capable of scoring a quick follow-up to his Phoenix win, especially when you consider he was runner-up in last year's Honda Classic and T6 in 2011.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries. Second and fifth on his last two starts, Woods will now look to add to a body of work at Augusta National which shows four wins and nine other top 10s, seven of those top fives. If you can't quite see Tiger getting it done, a top 5 or top 10 punt could be a very good way of cheering him on.
Woods  ->  positive

While genuine shocks are fairly rare at Augusta, increasingly so of late, the top-heavy nature of the market means that there are some candidates at 100/1 and upwards who appear to have a chance to contend. The pick of them is Bill Haas, and while his overall play in majors is a nagging concern in that he's been consistently on the fringes but never in the mix, at three-figure prices there's a pretty compelling case to be made for him. For starters, Haas is in great form.
Bill Haas,  ->  positive

Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
Rose  ->  positive

After running the world's top 40 players through all those qualification criteria, only five players survive. They are: Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia, Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell. Another stat:  Nine of the last 10 US Open winners were not the Masters champion  Sorry Sergio.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

The world’s top-ranked players will congregate in a small 65-player field packed with talent to duke it out over four guaranteed rounds. Dustin Johnson, now established as World No. 1 for over a year, will look to win three of the last four iterations of this event dating back to the 2015 edition played at Doral.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Whilst he missed the cut on his sole start here, back in 2014, the Fort Worth resident finished T11 at the Valero Texas Open one year later and he can feature atop a Texas leaderboard once again, this week. Statistically, Peterson looks good in the right areas for this event. Although these stats will be slightly inflated due to his limited starts (8), they are impressive, nonetheless.
Peterson  ->  positive

When you look at his stats and course history, you can see why. Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016.
Woodland  ->  positive

Other: Charl Schwartzel  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Jason Dufner, Tony Finau, Byeong Hun-An, Louis Oosthuzien, Kevin Tway  – Sung Kang, Xander Schauffele, DA Points, Charl Schwartzel, Nick Taylor, Ollie Schniederjans, Zac Blair  Bets:  Louis Oosthuizen 33-1  Byeong Hun An 67-1 ew  Sung Kang 70-1 ew  Xander Schauffele 140-1 ew I think his recent play and the set-up at this venue could lead to a monster week and I really like him at only $6,600 for play in big tournaments on DraftKings. Schauffele can bomb it off the tee (29th in Driving Distance) and also ranks very highly in par 4 scoring, including ranking second in efficiency on holes from 450-500 yards.
Zac Blair  ->  positive

Since that second place finish Luke has continued the good form with further stroke play finishes of 16th and 7th and this week he now returns to a venue he performed well at last year when finishing 3rd. There is evidence over the years that aggressive bomber types are rewarded at the Golf Club of Houston with past winners JB Holmes, Mickelson, Kim and Casey all falling in that category and therefore it no surprise that List has played well here over the past two years and I am confident he has another big week ahead of him this week. KEEGAN BRADLEY – 55-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finshed 43rd  Keegan Bradley has been knocking on the door of a comeback win for a while now and I can see him having another big showing this week.
Luke  ->  positive

Greens in regulation will be a key stat here along with approaches, strokes gained putting, scrambling, par 4 and par 5 scoring. Jordan Spieth 7/1  I don’t know what it is about Augusta but it seems to really suit Jordan Spieth. Despite missing the cut last week in Houston, Spieth has been in great form with a win and five top 25’s in his last seven starts.
Spieth  ->  positive

He ranks 5th in my weighted rankings, driven by his three straight top 20 finishes. Over his last 12 rounds, Campbell ranks 18th in SG:APP and is the 2nd best scrambler in the field for the year. There is no reason to believe a finish outside of the top 20 is in the cards this week.
Campbell  ->  positive

He’s projected for a chalky 26-30 percent ownership and leads all golfers this week with 11 Pro Trends. The Value Plays  Perhaps the most intriguing golfer in the field this week is Patrick Cantlay, a 25-year-old golfer who was formerly the world’s No. 1 amateur.
Patrick Cantlay,  ->  positive

Finally, his preparation has been near perfect. Speaking prior to the Honda Classic that he'd go on to win via the first of two successive play-offs, Thomas said he felt he just needed to get in contention again to establish some momentum. Beating Luke List there before forcing extra holes against Phil Mickelson in Mexico means he's done what he felt he needed to do and more.
Thomas  ->  positive

Let's quickly take a look at the course details and past five winners and then jump into the stats and fantasy approach. The Course  Muirfield Village Golf Club - Dublin, OH  Par 72 - 7,392 Yards  Greens - Bentgrass Greens  **Click to Enlarge**  Past Five Winners  2016 - William McGirt(-15)  - William McGirt(-15) 2015 - David Lingmerth(-15)  - David Lingmerth(-15) 2014 - Hideki Matsuyama(-13)  - Hideki Matsuyama(-13) 2013 - Matt Kuchar(-12)  - Matt Kuchar(-12) 2012 - Tiger Woods(-9)  The Stats & Fantasy Approach  My Key Stats:  Strokes Gained Tee to Green  Strokes Gained: Approach  Greens in Regulation from 175-200 Yards  Par 4 Scoring/Bogey Avoidance  Par 5 Birdie or Better %  Looking at the cheatsheet and the last three years results and correlated stats, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green shows up as the clear #1 stat to target. With Driving Distance and Accuracy both really low on the correlated list, it has me put a lot of emphasis on the Approach shot this week and specifically from 175-200.
Matt Kuchar(-12)  ->  positive

With that in mind, last year’s result is definitely the one for me to focus on. So far, Lovemark has made a steady start to the 2016/17 season, with a top-10 and a top-20 to his name already in his first five starts. He finished T20 at the Safeway Open, his first start of the season and on his most recent start, at the RSM Classic finished T6.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Outsider: Back Lucas Glover EW @ 150/1  We've done well with the long-shots in recent weeks with 200/1 Scott Stallings grabbing full each-way return at Pebble Beach and 100/1 Martin Laird missing out on a place by a single shot at Riviera. So let's try another triple-figure punt with 150/1 chance Lucas Glover. It's been a long time between drinks but all three of his PGA Tour wins have come over on his native East Coast and that includes the 2011 U.S. Open which he won with 4-under.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

He’s an athletic gamer who thrives on the grandest of stages, placing no worse than T21 in his last nine major tournaments. Koepka ranks sixth on Tour in both driving distance and birdie average, and he’s quietly T10 in SG: Putting as well. Glue Guys    Thomas Pieters - $14,900    The “Belgian Bomber” is up to a career-best 23rd in the Official World Golf Ranking after a fourth-place finish at the Bridgestone, where he had a share of the lead heading into Sunday’s final round.
Koepka  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay ($9,100) and Ollie Schniederjans ($7,400) are two other young American golfers who finished in the top five here last season and easily could replicate that feat again. Other names to consider for this format include: Emiliano Grillo ($8,600), Ryan Moore ($8,500), Matthew Fitzpatrick ($7,600), Si Woo Kim ($7,400), Charl Schwartzel ($7,300) and Bud Cauley ($7,300). Top Recent Form  1.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

I'm more than willing to take on board some unknowns in exchange for a big price about a player who will surely go close in this event many times over the next decade or so. Matsuyama has been a regular major contender ever since turning professional and I'm hopeful he can reach the frame once more. Ryan Moore, Jimmy Walker and Gary Woodland are three outsiders for whom a case can be made, while Kuchar looks good at 50/1 if your primary concern is the place part of the wager.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down. Sleepers  We are going to try something new this week with the new format.
Glover’s  ->  positive

Related: 2016 European Ryder Cup team  This week it’s the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston in Massachusetts. Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done.
Fowler  ->  positive

He has been playing some decent golf over the last couple of months with five top 11’s and a win in his last eight competitive starts. Day finished in a respectable T9 at the PGA Championship back in August followed by a T6 at the Northern Trust Open in Glen Oaks shooting a 69 or better in three of his four rounds. The Aussie then travelled to the BMW Championship in Conway Farms finishing solo fourth which included an opening 64 and a second round 65.
Day  ->  positive

It worries me slightly here with so much around-the-green work to be done, but if he continues to lap the field in SG: Approach and Putting, he’ll make enough birdies to counteract the hiccups. Oh, he’s the highest ranked player in the field too (16th), don’t forget that… I’m such a sucker for Dufner. He’s never been a great Pete Dye player, but his game theoretically translates perfectly.
Dufner.  ->  positive

That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance." He's also among the game's elite scramblers.
Fowler  ->  positive

Firstly, he has some Royal Birkdale pedigree having taken T7 there in 2008, an Open finish he’s only beaten once (T3 at St. Andrews in 2010). He’s not played well in this event since but some strong form this year, including 6th at Augusta National, 26th in the U.S. Open and T5 at the Travelers on his most recent start, suggests a challenge is brewing  Alex Noren  The defense of his Scottish Open crown didn’t go well (missed cut) but pulling the camera back a little to get a wider picture shows that he has a win (at Wentworth thanks to a closing 62), two top 10s (PLAYERS Championship and Open de France) and a T15 (Nordea Masters) in his last six starts. The Swede has played well, indeed won, in windy conditions and it’s notable that he was T19 on his Open debut at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and that included a double bogey at the 72nd hole.
Noren  ->  positive

With his price, I’d expect high ownership but Finau is not a player I want to fade this week as I think he sets up great for this event. Danny Lee – Cash – DK: $9500 FD: $8400  Last week I picked Danny Lee and discussed how he is the type of player that consistently plays well when he shows good form; this week I see no reason to jump off the train. Lee combines good form with great course history (defending champion) and although he will see high ownership he is a lock for me in any cash game format.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Mickelson spoke afterwards of some real off-course struggles this year, including severe fatigue, but says he's on the right track now and relieved to finally get rewarded for his hard work. Statistically, Mickelson was really close to his absolute best last time and despite a stop-start season, he yet again ranks inside the PGA Tour's top 20 in birdie average. Phil Mickelson  If low-scoring is indeed the order of the day, he's going to be suited by conditions and it's no surprise that the relatively straightforward test of Boston helped him find comfort where it had so obviously been lacking since his split with Jim 'Bones' Mackay.
Mickelson  ->  positive

1. Adam Scott, Australia -- Coming off a tie for fourth in The Barclays to open the FedEx Cup playoffs, Scott might be ready to win again, especially if he can make a few more putts. He climbed to fourth in the point standings by playing more like he did earlier this season, when he won the Honda Classic and the WGC-Cadillac Championship on consecutive weeks.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

Due to the wraparound season, they all count on this year's FedEx Cup and the American left-hander sits 13th on that list. After adding another top 20 at the CareerBuilder, Harman missed the cut at Torrey Pines and has then sat out the last few weeks to prep for the Florida Swing. He has some startling history at the Honda Classic having posted a ludicrous 61 in the second round in 2012, a course record which helped him finish tied 12th.
Harman  ->  positive

The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

But as he remains without a major, and with DJ, Spieth and McIlroy forming such a strong trinity at the top of the market, we're still able to take upwards of 20/1 about a player who simply looks ready for the next step. Following what might prove an ideal prep in Houston, where in rain-softened conditions he was in electric form for much of the week and finished with a flourish, Fowler looks the best bet at the Masters. While genuine shocks are fairly rare at Augusta, increasingly so of late, the top-heavy nature of the market means that there are some candidates at 100/1 and upwards who appear to have a chance to contend.
Fowler  ->  positive

Garrigus famously lost the plot to hand the St Jude Classic to Lee Westwood in 2010, and he’s been placed here at Copperhead on two of his last four visits. He puts his success here in Florida down to the fact he can go fishing inbetween rounds and with a new putter in the bag that he says he will never consider changing, Garrigus seems to be in a good place to double his career tally. That first win also came in Florida and more recently he’s caught the eye a number of times, notably when missing a short eagle putt which would’ve put him in the lead on Sunday at the CareerBuilder Challenge, which confirms that an eventual share of 17th doesn’t tell the whole story.
Garrigus  ->  positive

As only the fifth most expensive player, I think Sergio is decent value this week and gets my nod as the strongest DraftKings play among the top group. MY SLEEPER : Russell Henley ($7,000)  Henley is in the midst of his best season on tour and makes for an excellent target this week, on a course which should suit his game extremely well. The Georgia native won earlier in the season and has found some decent form recently too, including a T5 in his last start at the Greenbrier.
Henley  ->  positive

While he has yet to take home the hardware here at the RBC Heritage, he has come close a ton of times with seven finishes of second or third in his last nine events. Looking at the stats ranks here at Harbour Town over the last 24 rounds, Donald is the only player who ranks higher than Kuchar in DraftKings scoring and he also ranks 1st in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, 3rd in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, 6th in Strokes Gained: Around the Green, and 12th in Strokes Gained: Putting. With the terrible form, I would think twice before rostering him in cash games, but for GPP's it may be a good idea to get some exposure.
Donald  ->  positive

His record at the PGA is more spotty, but Johnson is simply playing too well to bypass, especially at the this price. Francesco Molinari - $6,800 (80-1)    As a member of the PGA Tour this season, the Italian has 12 top-25s in 17 starts and sits an impressive second in strokes gained approach, third in tee to green. Molinari is eighth in driving accuracy, and usually you have to be a real short hitter to rank so high.
Molinari  ->  positive

Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil. He has two top 5s in four events, gaining strokes on approach shots in all four (17.2 over his last four to be exact).
Noren  ->  positive

RFO - Jeremy Chapman - Texas Open - 2ew C Hoffman 25-1; 1ew Grace 28-1, Chappell 33-1, Horschel 35-1, Moore 28-1
Hoffman  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler took the title in 2015 and although his course record is feast or famine he can scarcely have arrived in better form. Fowler currently leads the tour in adjusting scoring average and it’s difficult to find any chinks in his armour. He missed the cut in New Orleans but that was a team format, when it comes to stroke play his record in 2017 is MC-4-1-16-12-3-11.
Fowler  ->  positive

We're targeting ball strikers this week, and Glover ranks near the top in those categories this year and should be on your radar as a GPP play. -- Taras Pitra  Jason Kokrak  Not a guy who will garner a lot of attention coming into Harbourtown, but quietly he has made five consecutive cuts, including a Top 25 at The Genesis Open. I also like his tournament history, where he is riding three consecutive Top 20s with a sixth place here last year.
Jason Kokrak  ->  positive

Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)  FanDuel ($10,900)  Ranked even higher in my overall model(#1) is Paul Casey as he is the only player in the field who ranks Top 10 in all four categories on my sheet(stats, history, form & DK average last 5). It starts with the course history as Casey has now finished 6th or better in three straight Masters appearances and for his career has made eight of 11 cuts with five Top 10 finishes. Then comes the form which is spot on as he is coming off a huge win at the Valspar in his last stroke play event to extend his cuts made streak to 26 dating back to the Sony Open last year.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta. Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn’t exactly fit the “bomber” prototype that tends to succeed here: he’s 182nd in Driving Distance (286.6 yards), but he didn’t play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition’s averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance off the tee – he sits 16th in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes.
Moore  ->  positive

Might dabble in Bubba and/or Furyk if the price is right but I think Charl and Knox are fades for me. TUESDAY UPDATE: Was expecting a much higher salary for Furyk. I think at $7,200 on DraftKings, it’s easy to take a risk of relative poor form.
Furyk  ->  negative

He's finished top-25 here the last three years, and all that's gotten him is a $1,000 drop in price over last year. Holmes has horrendous GIR numbers this season, but he does rank a remarkable seventh in strokes gained putting. Kevin Streelman - $7,300 (80-1)  Streelman has top-20s here the past two years.
Holmes  ->  positive

Ancer should be comfortable with the culture and language spoke on the property this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Charley Hoffman ($10,700) – This week’s Luke Donald, Charley has never finished worse than T13 in seven tries at TPC San Antonio, including a win last year. He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him.
Charley  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour. Get him in the first two rounds on FanDuel before his salary rises in future tournaments.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Justin Rose 20/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Rose has not played since the FedEx Cup play-offs so comes into this week fresh from a run of form that saw him finish inside the top-10 in each of the four FedEx Cup play-off events with a 2nd and three 10th place finishes. There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off. Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week.
Rose  ->  positive

Blaum has made the cut in all three events this season and finished no lower than 31st. As a bonus, Blaum finished 29th at Mayakoba a year ago, giving us a nice value his week  Zach Turcotte -- Charles Howell III ($7,500)  Following his 15th-place finish a week ago at The Shriners, it appears that CH III is back on board with being a solid cut-maker with upside. We are hoping to grab him this week at a little bit of a discount.
Blaum  ->  positive

My advice though is don't get caught in the 'must play Kapalua' camp - it helps but certainly isn't totally critical as Henley, Wilson and Palmer have proven in recent years. I must say though that since the introduction of the wrap-around season, Waialae winners namely Walker (x2), Gomez and Thomas have all played the Tournament of Champions. Course experience seems to be pay real dividends at Waialae as 11 of the past 12 champions had played the Sony Open multiple times prior to lifting the trophy.
Walker  ->  positive

It was interesting listening to Phil Mickelson in interview last year here where he talked at length about the nuances of altitude golf and how it can favour 'feel golfers' such as himself and with Bubba cut from a similar cloth in that respect, I can see him enjoying this week after finishing 38th on debut 12 months ago when at a very low ebb. Classical courses carry no concerns for Watson who's twice mastered Augusta National - and who's to say he won't contend again this year - and those tracks featuring Kikuyu on the fairways and rough and Poa Annua on the greens are clearly no issue, as was once again demonstrated at the Genesis on his last start. Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view.
Bubba  ->  positive

He’s got all of the tools – including length – to take down an event like this one, and it should only be a matter of time before he does. Thorbjorn Olesen ($7,700) – Olesen hasn’t exactly been at the apex of his game lately, but he is an immensely talented player who clearly is trying to lock down his PGA Tour card this week with a big finish. While I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s a world-class player, he’s definitely a few cuts above his competition here at a very good bargain price.
Olesen  ->  positive

DJ had the one missed cut which brings that average just below Molinari's despite winning back to back events(not including Match Play). Molinari hasn't won but has been incredibly consistent with finishes of T22, T33, T7, T20 and T14 over his last five events and has made 10 of 11 cuts this season with three Top 10's and eight Top 25 finishes. He also fits the stats model very well(4th overall) with elite ranks in SG: APP(2nd), SG: APP+OTT(4th), Par 4 Scoring(9th), Par 5 Scoring(6th), BoB%(11th) and is not a bad scrambler either, ranking 25th in the field.
Molinari's  ->  positive

Never a great Par 5 player, that impact with be mitigated, allowing his dominance on Par 4s (16th scoring average) and Par 3s (25th scoring average) to do the work. Basically, at courses that limit his driver and focus on the rest of his game, Haas regularly contends. Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth, Brandt Snedeker & Jimmy Walker – There’s absolutely no need to be a hero this early in the Fantasy golf season.
Haas  ->  positive

Other stats also look promising as Reavie has been gaining strokes approaching the green and putting once field adjusted. Ownership level will be an issue as you will have to decide what to do for GPP’s while in cash games Reavie is looking like an early lock. As always, this article is published as a first look, things change leading up to lock and SlackChat should be checked as thoughts are changed when new information arises.
Reavie  ->  positive

He also ranked 18th in scrambling and 37th in SG: Putting throughout the 2016-17 season. Cameron Smith - $14,400    Smith should be a popular selection at this price, despite the fact that he’s making his career debut at the Kapalua Resort. The 24-year-old most recently won the Australian PGA Championship as he posted his fourth consecutive top-five result.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

As always the Dean & DeLuca Invitational is a popular stop on the PGA Tour schedule, the Masters Champion Sergio Garcia and Jordan Spieth headline the 121 man field. Major champions Phil Mickelson, Zach Johnson and Graeme McDowell are also in attendance alongside Jon Rahm and the American trio of Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and Brandt Snedeker. Designed by John Bredemus & Perry Maxwell, Colonial Country Club is a tight Par 70 layout measuring 7,204 yards.

Robby Shelton at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - top-class talent in the making  Considering that host venue TPC Four Seasons is not perhaps among the more popular layouts on the circuit, another strong field has been secured for the AT&T Byron Nelson.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

McNealy won the Haskins Award as the top collegiate golfer in 2015 and has competed on the PGA Tour several times in the last two years. The sky's the limit for McNealy, and in a soft field on an easy course, young Maverick should shine. His price also allows for a great deal of wiggle room in constructing the rest of your roster.
McNealy,  ->  positive

All three will be popular this week and I will have a ton of exposure to Cauley and Reavie in cash games but feel there are some projected lower owned players in this range to help us separate ourselves in GPP formats. The first player I will be targeting is Chesson Hadley who I wrote up above. He currently sits T18 in tags and has just 11 start recommendations as of Wednesday afternoon.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner ($10,400) will likely be the lowest-owned player among golfers with a salary of $10,000 or more, making him a great pivot play off guys like Rahm and Harman. Kisner has made the cut in his last 12 events, his 69.0 LT Adj Rd Score ranks fourth in this field, and he is tied for 10th with his 14.0 LT Adj Bird Avg. The Value Plays  One way to use FantasyLabs to find potential value golfers in our Models is to leverage our LT Adj Rd Score metric.
Kisner  ->  positive

He ranks fifth in SG off the tee, second in SGTTG, 16th in GIR and fourth in par 4 scoring. Rahm is turning into a superb player and he has the power and the game to be a serious contender here. Gary Woodland 45/1  The big hitting American is in great form coming to Mexico this week with four top 10’s and a top 20 in his last six events.
Rahm  ->  positive

Recommended bets: WGC-Bridgestone Invitational      1pt e.w. Jason Dufner at 66/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) - straight hitter and that's a key trait that's needed at Firestone  1pt e.w. Justin Thomas at 50/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) - good record in Ohio and likely to be inspired by friend Spieth's Open show  1pt e.w.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

As for iron play, Fowler sits a very healthy 7th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green while he's 12th in Approaches from over 200 yards. Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio. That's the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC, a long par 70 with testing par 4s, and Fowler has cracked the top 10 in his last three appearances there.
Fowler  ->  positive

It certainly did last year when he cracked the top 10 for the first time and beat his previous best of T14 (R1 64) on just his second appearance back in 2007. Casey is hovering around the top 10 again of late after T11 in the Honda Classic and T16 in the WGC-Mexico Championship on his last two outings. "I'm loving my golf more than I ever have," said the Englishman at January's CareerBuilder Challenge and the good vibes could definitely continue here.
Casey  ->  positive

Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

The ownership projections you see here are my initial projections and will be updated as the week goes on so be sure to follow me on twitter to find out where you can get all the most updated ownership information. While it’s still early, this week Patrick Reed looks to be a good candidate if you’re looking for low ownership. While it’s clear he isn’t playing great now, his price has continued to drop and at some point you can expect Patrick Reed to bounce back.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Kevin Na ($8400): Na has a pretty sparkling course history here, with a T4 last year, T8 in 2012, and T9 in 2011 being his most recent successes (he missed the cut in 2014). Unfortunately, Na is not the same player he’s been in the past, and it’s shown this season with three straight missed cuts and only two top-10s in cut events. Na is struggling in some stats that show their importance this week, ranking a dismal 144th in GIR% and 65th in Birdie or Better percentage, but those stats have been inflated from playing the fall swing season events in weak fields on weak courses.
Na  ->  negative

Granted, there are others in this field who have been playing better but not always does this event go to someone who arrives on a tear. In fact, at 25th in the standings Garcia is in exactly the same position from which Bill Haas scooped the lot with that famous shot out of the lake in 2011. All things considered, Garcia looks a solid alternative to the more fancied runners after controversially sneaking into the field on Sunday night to earn a return to a course which plays to his strengths.
Garcia  ->  positive

Statswise he is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee and ranks 19th in SGTTG, second in SGP and seventh in par 4 scoring. Mickelson is brimming with confidence since winning in Mexico and has to be a big contender here this week. Luke List 25/1  List was a bit unlucky to break his putter last week in the first round of the WGC Matchplay.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Chad Campbell ($7,700): Campbell will likely be popular this week but with current form that includes three top 15’s over his last five starts and course history that includes being 8/8 in cuts made at this event, he’s not someone I’d want to fade entirely. Campbell can struggle on the greens but his approach game is still top notch. He makes for an excellent cash game play this week.
Campbell  ->  positive

The 28-year-old has three top 20s in his seven starts in the majors and he'll be particularly ramped this week as he'll be making his US Masters debut next week.

Vaughn Taylor ($6,300) – Has been playing well as of late, with a recent 15th at the Safeway Open, and has a 16th and a 25th in his two starts at this tourney. My main lineup in DraftKings this week as of right now, with $0 in the budget to spare: Russell Knox ($11,800), Si Woo Kim ($8,900), John Huh ($7,600), Charles Howell ($7,500), Shawn Stefani ($7,300), and Ryan Blaum ($6,900). Don’t yet have a daily fantasy sports account yet on FanDuel or DraftKings?
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

Selections    This is an extremely competitive and tricky heat and I've had to reign in my enthusiasm as I fancied quite a few. I like the look of Scott Piercy, Kevin Streelman and last year's runner-up, Patton Kizzire, to name but three, but I'm going to begin the tournament with just two serious selections - Jon Rahm and Jimmy Walker - and two outsiders for tiny stakes - Ryan Blaum and Ben Crane. Rahm's not a massive price at around [30.0] but if he kicks on this year it will look huge in the fullness of time because on all known evidence to date he looks like a future star and this course looks absolutely ideal for him.
Rahm  ->  positive

In 2015-16, not only did his PPT drop, but he also produced a negative Plus/Minus with the poorest Consistency Rating of his career. So far this season, Spieth has averaged a monster 105.6 PPT with an amazing 80 percent Consistency and +27.0 Plus/Minus — often with the highest salary in the field. Although these numbers are more than likely unsustainable, it’s not out of the question that Spieth could improve upon his averages from his 2014-15 season, since he is still approaching his prime.
Spieth  ->  positive

With single digits under par winning three of the last four Farmers Insurance Opens, Finau will get the sort of test he likes and, indeed, Torrey Pines is right up his street in many ways. The course suits his monster hitting (currently second in Driving Distance), it's a coastal track where it can really blow (Finau won his only Tour title by the sea at the windy Puerto Rico Open and has played well in his two Open Championship starts) and it features Poa Annua greens. Finau is ranked 12th on the Future of Fantasy's list of top performers on Poa since 2013/14.
Finau  ->  positive

@ 33/1  Tony Finau's record in the majors - T10, T14, T18 and T27 in just seven played - shows that he likes and can play well in tough conditions.

After a very slow start to the season, Johnson looks to have picked it up when it matters most, heading into the business-end of the season. In his last three starts he has finished 5th (John Deere Classic), 14th (Open Championship) and 2nd last week at the Bridgestone, so he has got it rolling once again. Johnson led the field in Strokes Gained: Putting last week at Firestone, which always bodes well heading into major week and if the rest of the game clicks this week, he could well get his third major victory and be just one step away (U.S. Open) from the Grand Slam.
Johnson  ->  positive

This season's tally is two and might well have been four and there are no signs at all that last season's heroics, which ended with a $10m FedEx Cup windfall, might instigate a downturn which some of those before him have faced.

He did miss the cut in 2014, as he battled his way through injuries, and finished T19 in 2015. The MC was a hiccup, with issues physically, much like Day when he’s gone in at full health, he’s dominated the event. He comes in at 33rd this week, as his Par 5 performance last season wasn’t as good as we’ve seen.
Day  ->  positive

With both coming in at excellent price tags and that low ownership, they offer high upside and allow for an extra stud up top. What to do with Rory: For the course history truthers, there’s no greater play this week than insane-chalk-to-be, Rory McIlroy. He’s won twice at Quail Hollow (both pre- and post-green renovations) and has three top-10 finishes that don’t even include his 2nd-place in a playoff, so this is obviously the track the Irishman loves the most on Tour.
Rory:  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler pictured in last year's renewal  Golf expert Ben Coley gives his take on Tiger Woods' chances at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, plus five each-way selections ranging from 20/1 to 250s. For those monitoring Tiger Woods closely, last week's runner-up finish at the Valspar Championship was either a case of perfect timing or premature something-or-other as he heads to Bay Hill in search of a remarkable ninth triumph in the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods had been quoted at 18/1 for this week's event by one firm prior to his effort in Tampa, but having contended throughout there the revised prices were understandably shorter when they arrived on Monday morning.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Justin Rose  ->  positive

That much is demonstrated by his record in the FedEx Cup Playoffs. Oosthuizen has eight top-20 finishes from nine starts in the three events prior to East Lake, including fifth in this and second in the Deutsche Bank, and on the back of that effort at Quail Hollow it seems reasonable to expect another strong run. Also noteworthy is the fact that he has won immediately after one of these major near-misses, albeit again in modest company out in Malaysia, while he's been second at Augusta and fourth at Firestone to tick those correlating course boxes.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

His PPT drops to 74.92 — nearly 10 points below his average as a favorite — and his Plus/Minus dips by -0.64 points. That his Consistency drops 10 percentage points with lower salary-based expectations is something to remember when Spieth tees it up with lower odds to win — but that’s probably not something to concern yourself with for the Master: At the time of writing, Spieth has 12.5 percent odds to win, the second-highest odds in the stacked Masters field. Last year Spieth had 12.5 percent odds to win and finished with a +21.86 Plus/Minus in the tournament.
Spieth  ->  positive

Casey has been sniffing around the top 10 in every WGC event he's contested in the last two years and should be again this week at a decent price. Last 4 events: 49-8-9-11  Course form: 16  WGC form: 11-5-R16-16-12-16-51-7  Last 50 starts - Win: 0%, Top 5: 20%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  The two players who look to be absolutely striping it right now also happen to have made the top five here last year - Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood. The market knows this and Thomas looks a restrictive back price but I think the [2.64] for a Fleetwood top 10 is worth a play.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Final Selections  Russell Knox 14/1 1pt EW  John Rahm 18/1 1pt EW  Scott Piercy 28/1 0.5 pts EW  Johnson Wagner 60/1 0.5 pts EW  Total staked = 6 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like me on Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Wagner clearly likes this venue and looks incredibly good value at 60/1. Statswise he ranks 22nd in SGP, 37th in GIR, 33rd in par 4 scoring and 34th in par 3 scoring.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

Dean & DeLuca Invitational - Final Round Stacy Revere  Now, I’m in a bit of a bind again with some of my choices. Both Johnson and Watson have been playing nowhere near their historical averages, yet the Model puts them in the ten picks. Well, I’ll just have to live with that.
Watson  ->  positive

A look at the course would be beneficial though, given the tough nature of the course and event. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title. Finau ranks highly in multiple areas this season, including top-25 in SG: Approach, Par-3 Scoring Average and Par-5 Scoring Average, all key areas this week.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

In his last 24 rounds, Streelman ranks 24th in SG: T2G, 32nd in Par 4 Scoring 450-500 and 6th in Par 4 Scoring 400-450. Also Consider: Sung Kang, Nick Taylor, Bill Haas, Phil Mickelson  GPP Pivots  Gary Woodland ($7,500) – Coming off the birth of his child, look for Gary to take advantage of these wider fairways. Ranks 5th last 24 rounds in SG T2G.
Bill Haas,  ->  positive

Watching Phil over recent weeks I feel like I’ve been watching a loop of a tape where his putts keep hanging on the edge or burning the edges and if he can just get one or two more to drop this could at last be his week. PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price.
Patrick Cantlay.  ->  positive

In addition to his win here, he played very well for most of the 2016 US Open finishing T2 behind Dustin Johnson. A player capable of playing in bad conditions is always good to have on side and with Snedeker and Lowry we have two. What also appeals about Lowry is his course history.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Take away a weather induced Rd 2 80 at the Genesis Open and Hideki has been nothing but consistent this season while also showing the ability to win. Rickie Fowler – $9,500: A lot of people might say Rickie is not an ideal Rds 3-4 golfer but his Key Stats this week in the FGI PGA Model along with excellent Current Form I believe tell a different story. I won’t argue with anyone who wants to leave him off their Cash game roster but there’s ton of merit for him making it onto your GPP roster.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Hard to ignore the combo. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Brandt Snedeker - $9,500 Jimmy Walker - $9,400 Jon Rahm - $9,200 Charles Howell III - $7,300 Aaron Baddeley - $6,900 Scott Stallings - $6,800  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis! Your first two months' dues will be donated to one of two charities: Special Olympics or The First Tee!
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

He’s having one of the better years of his entire career, and this is an excellent price for a guy who is pretty unlikely to blow the cut line for you. VALUE  Andy Sullivan ($7,100) – Sullivan has generally been good-not-great in the US, but there’s little question that he is in the upper/elite tier of the European Tour conversation. He threw down a nasty 67 last week at the Scottish Open and has a history of playing resilient golf under tough conditions.
Sullivan  ->  positive

Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Softer conditions could favour bombers but in reality everyone is in play for the win here making this an intriguing venue for fantasy and betting purposes. Stud Picks  Bill Haas ($10,800): Haas has some tight competition at the top of the salary charts this week with Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson also playing decent golf, but Haas has been better than both recently. He recorded his best finish ever in a major at Erin Hills with a T5, and has four top 25 finishes now over his last four starts.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Chappell’s 60.3 LT Driving Accuracy percentage should help him navigate this tight course, and his respectable 12.1 LT Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament (Adj Bird Avg) certainly won’t hurt him. Chappell is 1-1 in his attempts at The Open: He finished T53 last year at Royal Troon. A Two-Time Major Champion  Speaking of good LT Adjusted Rd Scores, Martin Kaymer — a two-time major championship winner and former world’s No.
Chappell  ->  positive

Laird looks to have a lot going for him here. It may seem a dubious play to Hudson Swafford just days on from his first Tour win. After all, he may just be happy to drink in that success and coast along here and enjoy the spectacular clifftop views.
Swafford  ->  positive

However, it’s another PGA Tour maiden who catches my eye at a bigger price with Bud Cauley considered great value at 100/1. Cauley struck the ball really well on his way to a top-10 finish at the Heritage last week and the move to TPC San Antonio, where he’s twice played well in just three visits, may see him step up another level and contend. He’s done so several times lately, including when just in behind Garcia and Koepka at the Nelson last summer, and at 58th of over 200 players ranked for driving distance he gets it out there far enough from the tee.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

The 2007 Masters Champion Zach Johnson, once said “You just have to be on your toes on every single putt you ever have in the Masters.” Spieth’s elite putting ability gives him an edge at Augusta. Spieth’s 17.1 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is also elite and gives him extra value, given the DraftKings scoring system. Rory McIlroy and the scorching-hot Dustin Johnson are the only golfers in the Masters field with higher LT Adjusted Birdie Averages.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

Bonus  Pro Trends: 13, Adam Scott ($10,100)  Scott currently leads all players in the field with 13 Pro Trends, one of which is a Rec GIR of at least 75. Scott’s 29.9 PPR average through his last three events is atrocious, but it is only 0.1 PPR more than his LT average. He excels by being one of the best ball strikers in the game, and right now his Rec GIR of 78.2 percent shows that he has been getting it done recently.
Scott  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players as follows;  RORY SABBATINI – 25-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 43rd  This pick is purely about current form. I said after watching Sabbatini at the Valspar on Sunday a couple of weeks ago that I felt he would win soon and until he either does so, or his form dips, I want to keep him onside. Rory is the sort of player who can play well anywhere if he is on one of his rolls.
RORY SABBATINI  ->  positive

That being said he still finished with an impressive final round 67 to finish solo third. Noren has been playing some great golf over the last year or so with form figures 3,16,21,2,12,31,45,12 in his last eight tournaments. His form has been particularly impressive over the last four weeks and despite losing a playoff, he had a great week in Torrey Pines shooting rounds of 70,66,,69,73 and followed that with a T21 in Phoenix.
Noren  ->  positive

He is a safe play in all formats. Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Curtis Luck ($6,300): *write-up coming*  Others: Danny Lee, Harold Varner III  High-upside GPP Picks  Billy Horschel ($8,900): Not a play I’m admittedly super confident in but a player whose upside at this course I still respect (much like Luke Donald last week). Horschel is coming off a terrible Friday round at Hilton Head but after a week to recharge (his family just welcomed another child to the world as well) I think he can rebound nicely here. Horschel has always liked tougher tracks and is -13 with no rounds worse than par at TPC San Antonio over his last eight rounds played there.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Statswise he ranks second in SGP, fourth in SG Approaches to the green and fourth in scrambling, three stats that will stand him well here. Mickelson clearly loves Augusta and with his great current form and natural right to left shape, he could be a huge contender here. Paul Casey 22/1  Casey arrives to Augusta in great form and will be feeling particularly confident after winning at Copperhead a few weeks ago at the Valspar.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Simpson’s last four opening rounds on bermuda greens have been 67-67-69-66 and he opened with a 67 here last year. Simpson will be teeing off at 08:07 on Thursday morning so will therefore get the best of the greens, something he should hopefully relish given his current form with the putter. He may well find himself in the winners’ circle for the first time in years this season, but on this occasion all we need him to do is lead by the end of Thursday evening.
Simpson  ->  positive

With rain a distinct possibility, Harold also thrives on receptive golf courses. Jonas Blixt 0.5pt EW 100/1 with NEW OFFER! Bet £10 Get £60 free here:  I'll finish with Jonas Blixt who's at an attractive price this week.
Jonas Blixt  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour. Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar.
Grillo  ->  positive

PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
Jason Dufner;  ->  positive

After starting the season off poorly, Haas has turned it around with decent showings his past few times out. Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well.
Haas  ->  positive

With all this in mind, here are my picks for the 2017 Players. Justin Rose 30/1 (Betfred 1/4 6 places) 1.5pts e/w:  A man who has plenty of starts here at TPC Sawgrass – Justin Rose would have been hoping for more than one top-5 and a measly two total top-20’s to his name. In 13 starts, his best finish here is a T4 in 2014, and his 19th last year was his next best finish, but I still think he has every chance of winning this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

RESULT: T70  Brian Stuard 1pt EW 100/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  We were on Brian Stuard last week at El Camaleon where he finished a single shot away from the extended each way places and I'm going to be patient with the Fort Worth, Texas-based 34 year-old who's playing phenomenal golf right now. A streaky scorer who clearly thrives on Bermudagrass and Paspalum putting surfaces, Stuard is also a strong coastal player.
Stuard  ->  positive

After a good performance here in 2015 there’s no reason why he can’t contend again. Paul Casey 30/1  The Englishman is having a fantastic season and comes here in great form. Since finishing solo sixth in Augusta at The Masters, Casey’s form figures read 12,22,10, 26, 5, 11.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($9700) – Another player coming off an interesting performance at the US Open, Casey has had success here his two times out – 2nd and T17 in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In 2015, Casey gained a massive 10 strokes to the field with the strength of his approach game, and that’s a repeatable skill that should help him this week. Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens.
Casey  ->  positive

With all this in mind, here are my selections for the 2017 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time.
Mickelson  ->  positive

It may be wise not to overthink it so I'm looking for a player with a strong record in NC which includes big finishes at the Wells Fargo. Step forward Webb Simpson. Back in 2011, I had a 20/1 'win only' punt on Simpson landing the Wyndham Championship and he obliged, shooting 66-65-64-67 to secure his maiden PGA Tour title.
Webb Simpson.  ->  positive

So it's hard not to like Rickie this week on a coastal course where wind will undoubtedly be a large factor. 2 visits have generated a 6th (2013) and 5th (2016) and it's true that Fowler has never arrived on Maui with such total confidence in his putter. Whilst Spieth, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have question marks against them in my mind with recent performances, Fowler seems at the peak of his powers and his record after winning is also an interesting angle.
Fowler  ->  positive

Ryan Moore came within a missed shortish range putt of winning this 12 months at 50/1 - he ranked 14th in the FEC. Kevin Chappell was 15th and also made the Playoff 12 months ago and this trend runs through to the likes of Danny Lee (19th), Justin Rose (12th), Jordan Spieth (13th), Luke Donald (15th), K.J. Choi (13th) and Jim Furyk (11th) since 2010.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

All in all though he’s not for me at the price, and I shall continue to watch his progress as a fascinated bystander. So on to this week’s picks and it’s five for me as follows;  JUSTIN ROSE – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 3rd  I shall say straight of the bat that I’m not really looking to reinvent the wheel with my picks this week and first up for me is Justin Rose. The case for Rose is a pretty obvious one this week and one thing Tiger’s presence at the top of the market does do is create a more than fair e/w price for the Englishman.
JUSTIN ROSE  ->  positive

Studs  *In order of my rankings  Jordan Spieth ($11,400)  Spieth sputtered a bit last week at the U.S. Open but came storming back Sunday with a 69 in difficult conditions. Surprisingly, Spieth’s ball-striking was solid, but it was his trusty putter that let him down at Erin Hills. That’s a good sign moving forward because we know he’ll regain his touch on the greens.
Spieth  ->  positive

Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks. He is third in the field in SG:APP, seventh in SG:ATG, sixth in Par 4 Scoring, fourth in Bogey Avoidance, ninth in Scrambling and first in Birdie or Better %.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Both have the expected ties to this event – Peterson was T8 on an invite in 2013, while Loupe made his PGA Tour debut here (note: Kevin Chappell’s pro PGA Tour debut came in the Texas Open, which he won last week). Local ties have revealed themselves in previous editions, which makes sense as this is the only PGA Tour stop in Louisiana, and the fact that Loupe was 11th in birdie average last season tells you plenty about his game. If – and it’s an almighty if – he turns up in the form which saw him share 10th two starts back, he could propel the partnership into contention at a huge 250/1.
Loupe  ->  positive

TYLER DUNCAN – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  I mentioned earlier in the preview that this event has graced the Web.com tour for the past two seasons and Duncan is one player who has tee’d it up in both renewals. In those two outings Duncan has finished 33rd in 2016 and 3rd in 2017 and in eight rounds on the course his worst performance is 70. Clearly therefore Tyler has enjoyed his time in the Dominican Republic.
TYLER DUNCAN  ->  positive

Saunders  ->  positive

I like that combination. -- Jason Sobel  Jimmy Walker  Just when you thought he was done, Walker gets to return to a course where it has always been feast or famine: two missed cuts (including 2014, the last time he played the tournament), as well as two fourth-place ties and a runner-up to boot. "Sky" Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7.
Walker  ->  positive

In his four starts on Bermuda greens so far this season, Johnson has ranked 33rd, 40th, 65th and 29th in SG: Putting and whilst it is encouraging that his best effort came last week, there is clearly scope for improvement. Should he find something on the greens this week, that he has struggled to so far this season, Johnson could well be in contention come Sunday. Despite his struggles on the green, Johnson does still rank 30th in Par 5 Scoring Average this season, and that will help him here.
Johnson  ->  positive

He comes in 12th overall in my model this week due to his lower ranks in Par 4 Scoring(64th) and BoB%(47th) but ranks 13th in SG: OTT + APP which really draws my attention this week. Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Both though need to show form and fast. That's not really a thought right now for Berger who at 30th in the FEC standings still has to perform well simply to qualify for the Tour Championship. He will draw masses from 12 months ago where, as a rookie, he performed magnificently at the BMW Championship finishing 2nd to Jason Day.
Berger  ->  positive

Eagle Point is a 2nd shot golf course as you have to be on the right tier of these greens to have a chance at birdie. This suits McGirt’s game pretty well. We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests.
McGirt’s  ->  positive

I've laid out my argument for Ross Fisher in this week's each-way column here and I'm following Paul Krishnamurty in with Alex Levy at a triple-figure price. Selections:  Martin Kaymer [44.0]  Ross Fisher @ [80.0]  Alex levy @ [100.0]    I'll be back later with my Sanderson Farms Championship preview later today. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter  https://twitter.com/SteveThePunter
Ross Fisher  ->  positive

Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Plug him in and don’t check your lineups until Friday night to avoid any mid-round tilt. Also Consider: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Ollie Schneiderjans  Dark Horse  Luke List ($7,600) – Oh man, you aren’t writing up List again are you? He burned some beautiful lineups last weekend.
Charley Hoffman,  ->  positive

In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory. Harman would join Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Mike Weir as left-handed players to have won here since the turn of the century.
Harman  ->  positive

1pt each-way Matthew Fitzpatrick at 35/1 with Betfred He’s won big tournaments before including the British Masters and DP World Tour Championship and competing for WGCs and majors is the next logical step on his career. Ranked inside the top-40 in the world now is the opportunity for him to make the breakthrough at a world level.
Matthew Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Marc Leishman has been in great form of late and deserves consideration, as does Kevin Kisner, who gained over four strokes on the greens the last time he played here. Value targets include Russell Henley (T3 here in 2015), Bryson DeChambeau and Si Woo Kim, who played through injury last year but enters 2018 seemingly healthy and coming off a T3 finish in his second last start. My Pick: Rickie Fowler ($10,500)  Fowler ended 2018 in perhaps the best form of anyone, landing a win at the Hero Open (where he closed with a 61) and a T2 in his second-to-last start in Mexico.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

Branden Grace withdrawing after the first round definitely beat up a number of otherwise promising cash lines as well. Poor Sunday performances by Kisner (77), CH3 (74), and RCB (74) further dinged our cash hopes, but fortunately a huge performance by the constantly underrated Gary Woodland along with solid showings by Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Brendan Steele, and a few of our hedge plays buoyed a number of subscribers to a positive ROI, including myself. I’d also like to extend a special congratulations for Scott P. on a pretty sizable GPP hit this week as well – nice work buddy!
Brendan Steele,  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
Rickie Fowler's  ->  positive

Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley. Plus, Ian Poulter, Steve Stricker, and Ryan Moore will be making their 2018 PGA debuts.
Brendan Steele,  ->  positive

After an impressive 61 in the final round last week at the Sony, Reavie will be feeling confident here and could have a good chance. Final selections –  Bill Haas 1pt EW 20/1  Jamie Lovemark 0.5 pts EW 33/1  Luke List 0.5 pts EW 50/1  Chez Reavie 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 5pts  Paddypower paying seven places! Good luck and enjoy the golf.
Reavie  ->  positive

Fowler bested McIlroy for the 2012 title in a playoff. He doesn't have quite the track record there as McIlroy, but Fowler has two other top-6s, including T4 last year. He's 13th on Tour in ball striking, 11th in strokes gained tee to green, 9th in scrambling, 1st in strokes gained putting, eighth in par-4 450-500.
Fowler  ->  positive

It will be interesting to see how Lingmerth responds after leading the first three rounds last week, only to falter in Sunday’s final round. Lingmerth has finished no worse than 16th here at the Old White, with two top-10 finishes in three starts. And despite not closing out the win last week, Lingmerth has been hot lately: He is tied for third in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

He is a player who looks to be finding form of old and worth keeping an eye on. Stuard on the other hand continued to do what he has done all season long – he impressed. Stuard’s T4 finish at the Sony this past weekend was his second top-4 and third top-10 in his first five starts this season, whilst also going 5/5 for cuts made.
Stuard  ->  positive

In my mind he's ready for his 5th PGA Tour victory. RESULT: MC  Jhonattan Vegas 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Let's be frank you never really know what you are going to get from Jhonattan Vegas but he's undoubtedly turned a corner over the last 20 months and he currently sits at 39th in the OWGR.
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Also Consider: Ollie Schniderjans, Russell Henley, Tommy Fleetwood, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Webb Simpson, Beyong–Hun An, Charles Howell (14/16 here, and has now made ten straight cuts, great value at only $6,900), Anirban Lahiri, and Billy Horschel. Regardless of what his ownership level ends up being (13-16% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs), Kaymer is an absolute steal at $7,400, and is a strong play in both cash games and GPPs. He has only played here at Bayhill once, missing the cut back 2008, but this was a long time ago, and Kaymer is a world class player who is in great current form.
Billy Horschel.  ->  positive

Although he did not look great last week at WGC Mexico I am not overly concerned as this course fits his style much more than what we saw last weekend. Charl Schwartzel – All Formats – DK: $7500 FD: $9800  Although Schwartzel has not seen his name atop a leaderboard in a while he has quietly been making plenty of cuts and has a great history here at Valspar. In the last two years Scwhartzel has finished T6 and won the event in 2016.
Schwartzel  ->  positive

Casey is still playing good golf as he showed with his T9 finish a few weeks ago at Abu Dhabi and although he has no course history he has shown over the years his ability to adapt to new courses. Casey also has an incredible streak of 24 made cuts making him safe despite the lack of course history. Patrick Reed – DraftKings Value – DK: $7900 FD: $10700  Whatever was wrong with Reed’s game a few weeks ago seems to be a thing of the past with back-to-back finishes inside of the top 25.
Casey  ->  positive

You get four opportunities with four par‑5s. So if I drive the ball in play, I have a pretty good chance to be successful out there," was how Gary described TPC Kuala Lumpur test back in 2014 and there's no doubt that Woodland can go low and loves soft, receptive conditions. Take last season as an example: 2nd at a soft El Camaleon came at -19/265; 6th at Waialae came at -17/263; 5th at a soft Pebble beach came at -12/275; 4th at a soft Glen Abbey came at -19/269.
Gary  ->  positive

Using the Strokes Gained stats, he was ranked 1st in SG: Approach-The-Green last week, gaining 8.652 shots on the field." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 8 places    Main Bet: Back Jordan Spieth e.w. @ 10/1  To be honest, I've spent most of the Masters build-up looking for one decisive sign.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

It’s the final major of the PGA Tour season and very likely the final golf Millionaire Maker on DraftKings until the Masters next April, so finding a low-owned player that produces a ton of fantasy points will be one of the keys to making a run in a huge guaranteed prize pool (GPP) like that. Amazing Grace  A few weeks ago, Branden Grace went goofy with a third-round 63 at the Open Championship — a round that propelled him to a sixth-place finish in that event. Per our Trends tool, in his last 11 majors, Grace has produced a very valuable +7.99 Plus/Minus with 63.6 percent Consistency.
Grace  ->  positive

Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town. He is a safe cash game play but does not provide much upside in tournaments.
Molinari  ->  positive

He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years. Haas only has seven tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to an equally priced Byeong Hun An, who has 20.
Haas  ->  positive

You really need to do everything well to score around here," he said two years ago so finishing second (BMW) and fourth (Dell Technologies) on the All-Around in the last two FedEx Cup Playoff events shows his game is in ideal shape to make an impression. Those two second places at East Lake add to a pair of runners-up finishes at nearby Augusta National so playing Rose 'without Spieth' makes extra sense given that he's been the nearly man so many times in Georgia. It's stating the obvious to say that Spieth would out-putt him if the two were locked together coming down the stretch so I'm convinced this is the best market for Rose this week.
Rose  ->  positive

He should go well and I’ll be backing him for a top 10. Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour / Brian Stuard; 3) Brian Harman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Colt Knost; 6) Austin Cook / David Hearn; 8) Kevin Kisner; 9) Lucas Glover / Brendan Steele; 11) Tyler Duncan; 12) Hunter Mahan / Steve Wheatcroft; 14) John Huh / Sean O'Hair; 16) Brice Garnett / Brian Gay; 18) Joel Dahmen; 19) Vaughn Taylor; 20) Alex Cejka / Kevin Streelman. Greens in Regulation : 1) Brian Harman / Kevin Streelman; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Brendan Steele; 5) Brian Stuard; 6) Ryan Armour; 7) Lucas Glover / Kevin Kisner; 9) Sang-moon Bae / Chesson Hadley / J.J. Spaun; 12) Patton Kizzire; 13) Austin Cook; 14) Peter Uihlein; 15) Scott Piercy; 16) Alex Cejka; 17) Kevin Chappell / Beau Hossler / Trey Mullinax / C.T. Pan.
J.J. Spaun;  ->  positive

He also finished 2nd in tee to green at Honda Classic. Checking the box in multiple categories and playing back in Florida, Billy Ho is our other dark horse this week. Others to consider: CT Pan, Steve Stricker  Chalk to Fade  Matt Kuchar ($10,400) – Yes, Kuchar provides you that “safety” you want in a cash game play.
Billy  ->  positive

He fell beck over the weekend shooting rounds of 72 and 78 but really looked to be hitting the ball really well and putting beautifully. Hoffman has a good record here finishing T8 in 2012, T6 in 2013 and T14 last year. If Charley can regain some of last week’s confidence from rounds one and two he could go very well here.
Hoffman  ->  positive

If he’s motivated, Spieth is my pick to win. Looking at my recent strokes gained model, Spieth ranks seventh. Justin Thomas ($10,200)  Thomas shot a record-setting 63 on Saturday at the U.S. Open, but just didn’t have his best on Sunday.
Spieth  ->  positive

It is GOLDEN CHERUB chalk week. Cam Smith has been HOT, can he keep it going as a first timer? We shall see.....… https://t.co/0qiHzBRD0y
Smith  ->  positive

Harold Varner III ($6300): To afford a player like Jon Rahm, it’s necessary to squeeze in one of the cheaper players with upside, and Varner fits that to a tee. Although he’s not currently the longest hitter on Tour, Varner sits T45 in Carry Distance and in the past has been known for his distance. The “Dab King” averages 3.74 birdies and converts birdie or better on 16.03% of approach shots between 150-175 yards.
Varner  ->  positive

With four par 5s on hand this week, I like the Georgia Bulldog who has seven eagles in his last 10 starts. Aaron Wise ($8,100): The Oregon standout is generally lights out with his long irons which should be key this week. He's a West Coast guy but these overseeded greens don't require a steep learning curve.
Aaron Wise  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
Fowler's  ->  positive

3rd at the CIMB Classic and 2nd in the KJ Choi Invitational both in October shouts value to me and there are other strong points I really like this week. 50th in Birdie Average and 18th in Putting from 5-15 feet in the embryonic PGA Tour statistics tell a story and Kang's record at El Camaleon specifically and in Mexico in general is interesting. Opening rounds of 67-67 placed Kang in 2nd place here after 36 holes on course debut way back in 2011 and he was still 6th going into the final round.
Kang's  ->  positive

Zach Johnson has won this twice, while Bud Cauley has current form of 5-5-10-9. I can't quite settle on any though so I'll jump all the way down to 80/1 (was 100s, grrrrrr) and have a punt on Sean O'Hair. He shot 67-69-68-68 to finish T5 in last week's AT&T Byron Nelson Championship so arrives full of confidence and his stats were particularly relevant to this week.
Sean O'Hair.  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Chappell  ->  positive

He doesn't play a lot, with only 13 starts all season, but he's accrued five top-25s. Jones has missed only one cut since March and is coming off a T18 in his last start at Memphis. Always considered a good putter, his numbers there are down this year (70th in SG: Putting), but he's 11th in scrambling, 62nd in SG: Tee-to-Green and 55th in SG: Total.
Jones  ->  positive

There are also some cheaper golfers that are attractive when you combine Driving Distance and Greens in Regulation. Paul Casey ($8,300) is currently 49th in Driving Distance and 11th in Greens in Regulation. He has made nine straight cuts this year.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously.
McGirt  ->  positive

Mix in his recent hot irons and always solid short game (first in the field ATG over the last 12 rounds), and you just need his putter to show up. And unlike many of my picks this week, Hadwin actually is an excellent putter, especially on poa greens. He uncharacteristically has dropped strokes putting in his last three starts, but he gains over 2.5 strokes, on average, on poa greens per event in his career.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $10000 – Coming off a tie for second at Colonial last week, Spieth is back in form and will take a liking to putting the quick greens at Muirfield. His scrambling percentage has been subpar this season to date, but with an elite iron game and putting that turned the corner last week, look for Spieth to shine in Ohio. Matt Kuchar, $9500 – If there’s a horse for the course this week, it’s Kuchar, who has notched six career top-10s in 11 starts at Muirfield, including a win in 2013.
Spieth,  ->  positive

With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
Martin  ->  positive

RESULT: T44  I'll also have a dabble with a couple of longer shots at a tournament where we know crazy winners can and do happen:  Ryan Palmer 0.5pt EW 150/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Texan Ryan Palmer loves a home game and despite a very poor period of play he ranks 7th in this week's Published Predictor Model. Palmer, who co-led at PGA National after 36 holes last time out, loves to play in his home state: top 5s and top 10s abound for Ryan across TPC San Antonio, TPC Four Seasons and his home course of Colonial. Statistically Palmer sits 9th in Going for the Green and 48th in Proximity from 150 to 175 yards, which are 2 key statistics for the GC of Houston.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

This week, several golfers with great LT Adj Rd Scores and low salaries are available: Stewart Cink (who looks like the value chalk play this week), Chad Campbell, and Luke List. Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips.
Campbell,  ->  positive

Back JJ Henry 1u @ [1000.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [50.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [15.0]  Back JJ Henry for a Top 20 Finish 1.5u @ [8.0]    If Si Woo Kim can win the Fifth Major from the maximum odds of [1000.0], so too can this Texan course specialist! You have to go back a few years but Henry has plenty of course form, with third place in 2012 the best of four top-13 finishes. The 42-year-old has always been the type to pop up in serious contention every so often at enormous odds.
Henry  ->  positive

Advanced statistics support Streelman’s case too ranking him in the Top 10 in value this week. Julian Suri ($7,600) – Julian Suri mainly plays on the European Tour, but he’s shown lately that he can certainly hack it over here. More specifically, he can hack it in Texas.
Julian Suri  ->  positive

I love him to compete for the W this weekend. Daniel Berger ($8,900)- Coming off a 7 th place finish at the WMO, Berger, comes to PGA National where he has found success in the past placing second in 2015. He also missed the cut last year, so buyer beware, but still, I like his upside.
Berger  ->  positive

After a good performance here in 2015 there’s no reason why he can’t contend again. Paul Casey 30/1  The Englishman is having a fantastic season and comes here in great form. Since finishing solo sixth in Augusta at The Masters, Casey’s form figures read 12,22,10, 26, 5, 11.
Casey  ->  positive

Other: Adam Scott, Tommy Fleetwood, Graeme McDowell  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama, Paul Casey, Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, Jason Dufner, Martin Kaymer, Zach Johnson, Branden Grace  – Ryan Palmer, Russell Henley, Ian Poulter, Bubba Watson, Adam Scott, Tommy Fleetwood, Graeme McDowell, Kevin Kisner, Molinari  Main Bets:  Jordan Spieth 16-1 (opened at 14-1)  Paul Casey 45-1 ew  Jason Dufner 80-1 ew  Russell Henley 80-1 ew  Graeme McDowell 140-1 ew With his playing privileges reinstated for the year, I think a free-swinging Poulter could surprise here and at only $6,600 he’s a perfect stars and scrubs play. He’s also made nine of 11 cuts at this event and has a runner-up finish here too from back in 2009.
Graeme McDowell  ->  positive

You could make a case Hoffman should be the favorite this week, so these bigger than expected odds make him a must play. Billy Horschel - Billy Horschel hasn’t looked sharp since the Arnold Palmer, but he still has four top-25 finishes and was tied for fourth at the Honda Classic. Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average.
Horschel  ->  positive

After time off for the necessary rehab Jamie a historical fader of the ball had developed a hook in his game, which coupled with the pressure he was under to fulfil a Major Medical Exemption lead to real struggles on the course. Eventually under the guidance of Chris Como and with a lot of hard work, Lovemark re built his game and career through the Web.com tour and this is now his third consecutive full season back on the PGA Tour. Each of the last two seasons has seen a string of steady performances and high finishes and the only thing that has been missing from the CV is the win.
Jamie  ->  positive

Zach Johnson should go well after another promising effort last week  Johnson remains an above-average putter, but it's a while since he's been a deadly one and combined with the fact that he cannot overpower any golf course, that explains why too often he's been on the fringes of contention without adding to his impressive haul of 12 PGA Tour wins. Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark.
Johnson  ->  positive

With it being a par-70, the par-5 scoring won’t be an impactful loss. Because of the accuracy and steadiness, Reavie is 27th in Bogey Avoidance, but he’s also been steady on the greens at 16th in 3-Putt Avoidance. He doesn’t score enough to make him an elite DraftKings play, but he can finish high enough here to pay off his cheap salary.
Reavie  ->  positive

I don't care what stats or data you show me, I'm never paying $8,700 for McGirt when Justin Thomas is $8,600. Take my money.
McGirt  ->  negative

His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Jordan Spieth. Why back off now?
Spieth  ->  positive

Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Webb Simpson - $10,200  2. William McGirt - $8,700  3.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

He is second on the European Tour in GIR and he's even 18th in putting, the weakest part of his game. Tier 2 Values    Justin Rose - $9,600 (20-1)    Rose has three top-4s in four starts this year, including tournaments played at Torrey Pines and Riviera. He's a horrid 164th in driving accuracy, but still is fifth in strokes gained tee-to-green.
Rose  ->  positive

We like him as the sneaky play. Fade: Jason Day. Very few signs of life lately and tough to forget the opening-round 79 at the U.S. Open last month.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

7th here in 2014, wind and a soft course are the kind of conditions where Ryan truly comes to the fore. RESULT: MC  Bud Cauley 0.5pt EW 200/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  Bud Cauley has always been an aggressive sort whose tee-to-green game can be very effective. He performs better at low-scoring tests and his record here reads 8th in 2012 (on debut) and 16th in 2013.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

In three starts at this course, Finau missed his first two cuts, before finishing 5th here last season, largely thanks to a final round 64. Finau will be looking to join Woodland as a bomber to break the mould here at Copperhead and buck the trend of shorter winners getting their name on the trophy here. His missed cut at the Phoenix Open was his first of the season and his only one so far, and he bounced back with a T2 finish at the Genesis Open on his next start.
Finau  ->  positive

Considering the confidence he is entering with, seeing Fowler figure out the Plantation greens this year wouldn’t be shocking, and his course history suggests that even a slight improvement in this area could mean a win in the first event of 2018. My Sleeper: Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000)  DeChambeau will be making his first appearance at this event after winning the John Deere Classic late in the 2017 season. Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts.
Bryson  ->  positive

He started strongly with a T13 at the Safeway Open back in October and followed that with a T17 at the CIMB Classic, T15 at the CJ Cup, T24 at the WGC-HSBC Champions, T14 at the OHL Classic and T18 at the Sony Open in Hawaii in January. Reavie has been playing particularly well over the last couple of weeks with back to back seconds. He came close to victory in Phoenix getting himself into a playoff with Gary Woodland after shooting an impressive final round 66 but lost the sudden death playoff to a par on the tricky 18th.
Reavie  ->  positive

Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
Sergio Garcia  ->  negative

He still carded yet another top-ten finish, so disregard him at your own peril. Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout.
Jon Rahm:  ->  positive

I’ve written before about what’s already been an up-and-down career for a player who took a Spieth-like route to the PGA Tour before Spieth himself, so I’ll give you the abridged version this time. Essentially, Cauley looked to have the world at his feet and went close on a number of occasions straight out of college, but injuries and a loss of confidence then seriously hampered what promised to be an exceptional career. However, a Web.com Tour win a couple of years ago signalled a return to where he belongs and Cauley went close in last year’s Byron Nelson before threatening to win again at the start of this year, eventually finishing third in the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Cauley  ->  positive

English has suffered a difficult 2017, but he’s been able to perform at some of those courses I’ve mentioned and to be honest it’s amazing he’s made any cuts at all given how abysmal he’s been off the tee, which played a part in his making an 11 at the Travelers last month. However, there was a noted step up on his latest start when T29 at the Greenbrier, where English made gains off the tee in every round, eventually ranking 19th in the field. Considering he’s only just inside the top 200 this season, that’s a jolt of improvement worth noting.
English  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card. When he is on, he hits greens as well as anyone on tour.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

Going Against the Grain  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Off The Tee  Par 5 Birdie or Better  It’s hard to fit Daniel Berger ($11,300) into either of these categories because he does so many things well on the golf course. To be fair, Berger is a volatile golfer with a runner-up finish, missed cut and a victory in his last three starts. Berger’s stat line for 2017 is as impressive as they come though, as you can see below.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

He has not finished outside the top-40 since his last missed cut at the Players Championship and his last three starts read T7 (Greenbrier Classic), T27 (Open Championship and T5 (RBC Canadian Open) so he is coming into this week with plenty of form. In terms of course form, Finau has done ok in limited starts at Quail Hollow, finishing 16th and 28th on his two starts there in 2015 and 2016. Statistically this has been a very impressive year for Finau so far, ranking 4th in Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee, 6th Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green and 30th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-green.
Finau  ->  positive

A brilliant and unlucky runner-up at Augusta, the Englishman is 4th on the All-Around in 2017 and 16th for GIR. Henrik Stenson  It’s well documented that Stenson is best played in the final two majors of the season. Evidence?
Stenson  ->  negative

What you read next is a little bit of evidence with a mixture of good and bad luck, so take it for what it's worth. En route to my league title in 2015-16, I reserved Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth for the first, third and fourth events of the Playoffs, respectively, and still won despite a T31, T42 and T17 from those cornerstone investments. (Emiliano Grillo's T33 at TPC Boston didn't help much, either.)
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

There is an argument to be made that a four-week break will lead to some rust in his first event back, but I suspect Rose will fare well around a course he likes despite the time off. Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week. Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event.
Rose  ->  positive

So if the 24 year-old starts the New Year in exactly the same vein as 2016, it will undoubtedly be hard for the other single-digit priced contenders, namely Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson or a rusty Jason Day, to stay in his slipstream. RESULT: 2nd  Brandt Snedeker 2pts EW 20/1 with  Brandt Snedeker loves Hawaii so much that he arrived on Maui on Boxing Day and as we know he absolutely thrives when it comes to both coastal golf and the West Coast swing. Buoyed by delivering a fantastic 3 points from 3 matches at the Ryder Cup, Sneds travelled directly to Fiji and won the co-sanctioned European Tour event with ease in tough, windy conditions he excels in.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’.
Casey  ->  positive

From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore. 2nd at Quail Hollow to Rory McIlroy at the classical Quail Hollow in 2015 stands out, as does 6th at Silverado in 2015 and 4th at Torrey Pines this season from a classical tree-lined perspective.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights. A good start to the season, and a return to the course that literally saved his career, there is a good chance we see a buoyant Vaughn Taylor this week, as he looks to build on his efforts in Phoenix last week.
Taylor  ->  positive

The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups. Value Plays:  Paul Casey $8,400 – The case for Paul Casey is fairly simple as he is easily the most glaring error in pricing that jumps out at us. He is a box-checking machine this week as far as Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, and Strokes Gained: Off the Tee.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

The left-hander was a big eye-catcher in Boston, where the long game and the short game worked in harmony for sixth place - his best strokeplay finish since last year's second place at the Open Championship. Mickelson spoke afterwards of some real off-course struggles this year, including severe fatigue, but says he's on the right track now and relieved to finally get rewarded for his hard work. Statistically, Mickelson was really close to his absolute best last time and despite a stop-start season, he yet again ranks inside the PGA Tour's top 20 in birdie average.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Chris Kirk ($9,100) – Kirk has missed back-to-back cuts on tough tracks, and now comes to an easy course in a weak field. This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one. I have a slight concern with Kirk in that he’s never played here before, but raw talent should get him into contention this week.
Kirk  ->  positive

Michael Thompson  3. Billy Horschel  MY PICK : Xander Schauffele ($8,800)  Schauffele comes into this week’s event playing solid golf, but still looking for his first top-five finish of 2018. The 2017 Rookie of the Year has made his last four cuts in stroke play and will be making his second appearance at this venue after missing the cut last season.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Top 5 Finishes So Far This Season  1st – Aaron Wise – $8,800 – Byron Nelson – Week 20  1st – Jason Day – $9,400 – Farmers Insurance – Week 4  1st – Bubba Watson – $8,200 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  2nd – Patrick Reed – $7,700 – Valspar Championship – Week 10  2nd – Chez Reavie – $8,000 – AT&T – Week 6  2nd – Adrian Otaugui – $7,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Lucas Herbert – $7,100 – Rocco Forte Open – Week 19  3rd – Brandon Steele – $7,800 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  3rd – Alex Noren – $8,700 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  3rd – Jorge Campillo – $8,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Emiliano Grillo – $8,600 – Fort Worth Invitational – Week 21  4th – Seungsu Han – $7500 – Oman Open – Week 7  5th – Chris Paisley – $7,400 – Dubai Desert Classic – Week 4  5th – Phil Mickelson – $8,700 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  5th – Seungsu Han – $8,500 – Corales Puntacana Championship – Week 12  5th – Webb Simpson – $9,400 – RBC Heritage – Week 15  5th – Jorge Campillo – $8,500 – Espana De Open – Week 15  5th – Phil Mickelson – $9,200 – Wells Fargo – Week 18  Euro Tour Picks sponsored by Golf Predictor – for all your DFS stats for both the European & US PGA Tours.

Noren  ->  positive

Brian Harman  3. Kevin Kisner  MY PICK : Bud Cauley ($8,000)  Cauley has accumulated four top-10 finishes in his last five starts and has quickly become a proven commodity for fantasy. While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish.
Cauley  ->  positive

Daniel Berger is tournament favourite and might be a dual winner already in 2017 but for Spieth performing his party trick again from a bunker at the Travelers Championship last month. Kevin Kisner and Kyle Stanley are also recent winners who figure prominently but I am going to delve a little deeper and go for Hilton Head hero Wesley Bryan, who is quite an attractive 80/1 chance. It was a pretty tense old finish at the RBC Heritage but Bryan displayed plenty of bottle over the closing holes to pip course specialist Luke Donald by a shot and get off the mark on the PGA Tour.
Wesley Bryan,  ->  positive

As highlighted in the preview, I'm going to be concentrating on the leaders from very early on and if Rose, a notoriously slow starter, begins well, I'll be looking to get him onside but he looks a risky play before the off and he makes little appeal in this very competitive market. Rose's closest rival here is Paul Casey and he has just the right all-round game to make an impression in a US Open but his pedigree isn't great. His tied 10th at Oakmont ten years ago is his best effort and Rose backers may have more to fear from young guns, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Tyrrell Hatton.
Rose,  ->  positive

His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour.
Stewart Cink  ->  negative

More relevant here are his strong birdie average stats (31st last season) and wealth of experience in Asia, where he cut his teeth as a professional, while his seventh in the Wyndham and back-to-form 12th in the BMW Championship suggest that the CIMB Classic comes just at the right time. There has been an Australian in the frame in each of the four renewals here at TPC Kuala Lumpur and Smith looks well-equipped to at least match his own effort three years ago. Recommended bets: CIMB Classic  1pt e.w.
Smith  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for The Northern Trust. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Dustin Johnson ($10,800)  DJ hasn’t been in the best for this summer, but he played well enough in the last two majors to intrigue me. After injuring his back and missing the Masters, it’s been a tough road back to the top, but DJ is close.
DJ  ->  positive

The veteran has yet to win this season, but the consistency he’s shown and his improved play in the bigger events means he warrants consideration as a sub-7k target. Haas also ranks sixth in efficiency on par 4’s from 450-500 yards and is also top-ten in bogey avoidance for the year, making him well-suited for a venue which played as the seventh toughest on tour last season. He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS.
Haas  ->  positive

Also giving him confidence will be the fact he comes into this event as a PGA Tour winner for the first time. Berger won the 2016 FedEx St.Jude Classic, beating Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Steve Stricker by 3 strokes. The St.Jude Classic is played at TPC Southwind, another short (7,244 yards) Par 70 course.
Berger  ->  positive

Koepka was runner-up here last season and has averaged 82.8 DK points over his last three starts; he’s also only $10,200. Other high floor/value targets include Matt Kuchar ($8,700), Russell Henley ($8,300), Ryan Moore ($7,600) and Sung Kang ($7,400). Tournaments: My favorite likely lower-owned play among the top players this week is Jordan Spieth ($10,800).
Russell Henley  ->  positive

If you are playing the Yahoo format or even the PGA fantasy league than you are severely limited on starts. It does no good to name Dustin Johnson or Jordan Spieth every week. I will make sure my picks as low as possible and spread the field out to introduce new names.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

His putting can be tilting at times but his ballstriking should help limit blowup holes. In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats.
Molinari  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix. Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights.
Taylor  ->  positive

Lovemark has only played this event once (last year – T52) but the lack of experience is made up for by his recent form and bargain pricing this week. Even though we haven’t seen his best golf for a while, Lovemark is still ranked 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and has accumulated seven top-10s in the past year and a half on tour. With this sort of pedigree, and a game possibly on the upswing, this is a great time to buy low on Lovemark, as he has plenty of upside for the price we are getting this week on DraftKings.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Hoffman  ->  positive

He should go well and I’ll be backing him for a top 10. Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season.
Glover  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel: Brandt Snedeker ($10,000)  The winner of this event in 2013 and '15, he's looking to keep that odd-year streak going this week. Sneds isn't just a horse for these courses; he's also playing well right now, as evidenced by a title contention at Torrey Pines two weeks ago.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should. It’s not a bad price, but the likely ownership, less than stellar form and lack of success at Riviera leads us to fade him completely.
Tony  ->  negative

Bradley was first for greens in regulation at the Travelers so his irons were dialled in while he was third on the All-Around so did everything well. If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there.
Bradley's  ->  positive

He followed that with a T15 at Memorial, T27 at The Open Championship and a T24 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. Day played well in this event over the last few years finishing T4 last year, a win in 2015 and a T2 in 2014. Statswise he ranks 23rd in driving distance, second in SG around the green, 47th in SGP and 17th in par 5 scoring.
Day  ->  positive

The current World No.39 has had an excellent 2017 and is another who should have taken plenty of positives away from his US Open performance. Hoffman finished eight there and his closing 1-under 71 included a triple-bogey 7 so could have been higher. He's since followed that up with T3 at the Travelers Championship where he shot all four rounds in the 60s.
Hoffman  ->  positive

He’s now ranked 12th in Strokes Gained: Approaches among all the playoff runners and actually had a decent week of putting in Boston as he ranked T22 in Strokes Gained: Putting there. Grillo should also have gotten a boost of confidence from being selected as a President’s Cup captain’s pick recently for the international team. This is a good young golfer who is likely tired of seeing some of his peers outshine him recent weeks, and a big performance here would not shock me.
Grillo  ->  positive

(He's the Wild Card in the Fantasy Insider column.) But that's OK because Justin Rose is a suitable surrogate. At No.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Adam Scott: Scott hasn’t played here since 2014, when he finished fourth. Scott’s 70.7 LT GIR percentage is fourth, and his 15.0 LT Adj Bird Avg is eighth. Scott has two top-10 finishes in his last three tournaments, and he is tied for seventh with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score.
Scott:  ->  positive

While he has just one finish inside the top 10 at Augusta National, T11 and T12 in the last three years back up the idea that he'll always give you a run for your money in these markets on this course. Last four events: 43-14-37-MC  Course form: 11-MC-12-5-38-27-38  Last 10 majors: 5-22-5-11-33-46-MC-MC-30-30  Last 50 starts - Win: 2%, Top 5: 22%, Top 10: 38%    Conclusion  I couldn't quite pull the trigger on Justin Rose in the outright market but I have no hesitation making him my best top 10 punt here. Rose has the most robust greens in regulation stats at Augusta National of any player in the field this week and that will get you the top 10s.
Rose  ->  positive

8. Rickie Fowler, United States -- Not only did Rickie squander a chance to win The Barclays by fading down the stretch to tie for seventh, he played himself out of an automatic spot on the United States Ryder Cup team. Now he has until Sept. 12 to convince Davis Love to make him one of four captain's picks and he can start this week when he defends his title in the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011. Jim is in great form and while he is a slow starter should fare just fine here as his average finish position is 30th.
Jim  ->  positive

He will force DraftKings players into an interesting decision though, as $13,000 is a steep price to pay. Luke List has been at or near the top of ownership levels in his last few events and he hasn’t really paid off. In addition to distance, Par 5 Scoring is always an important stat to target on a long par 72 course like Eagle Point.
Luke List  ->  positive

However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark. In 14 starts here, he's backed five top-10 finishes, missing the cut only once, and it was encouraging to see a return to bermuda provoke an improved putting display when he finished 14th at the Valspar Championship last week.
Johnson  ->  positive

He has some startling history at the Honda Classic having posted a ludicrous 61 in the second round in 2012, a course record which helped him finish tied 12th. Harman went low again with a closing 64 in 2015 for T11 and he was also T11 at halfway last year before fading on the weekend. "The course definitely fits my eye for whatever reason.
Harman  ->  positive

While his season stats may not jump off the page, Chappell has moved himself up into the top 40 in Strokes Gained: Approach and Tee to Green stats, and it’s his recent form I would emphasize here over his season stats. Chappell was third in both Strokes Gained: Approach and Tee to Green numbers in his second last start in Memphis, and in this weakened field a similar type of performance may see him get over the hump for the second time in the last couple of months. At $9,300, he’s also great value from a DraftKings perspective, as he’s only the seventh most expensive golfer this week, yet has the fourth highest Official World Golf Ranking in the field.
Chappell  ->  positive

For all the imponderables this event presents, what previous renewals tell us is that those ranking inside the top five in greens will have outstanding chances to win if they can manage their mistakes. On the strength of his first two visits, his improvement since the second of them, and his form all year, Thomas is firmly expected to be one of those five. Another point which could be significant is how diligent Thomas has been in his homework.
Thomas  ->  positive

When we go against the grain, we’ll be targeting distance, long par 5 scoring, and scrambling. Going With The Grain  Driving Accuracy  Strokes Gained: Approach  Greens in Regulation  Par 3 Birdie or Better  Jordan Spieth ($12,000) and Matt Kuchar ($9,300) will forever be linked thanks to Sunday of The Open Championship this year. It’s hard to argue against Spieth from a recent form standpoint, with two victories in his last two starts.
Spieth  ->  positive

He followed up a tied-5th showing at the Wyndham Championship with another top 20 at The Barclays on the fiendishly difficult Bethpage Black. So I am prepared to take a chance and have a small punt on Horschel at a best priced 66/1 to give us a run for our money. Brooks Koepka already knows he is going to Hazeltine.
Horschel  ->  positive

Tway is someone I will manually adjust down my draft board. Harold Varner III (51.08 Projected Pts): At the start of the season this probably would have been a spot to circle HV3 since it's a long, par 72 which gives him four good chances per round to rack up birdies and eagles. However, he arrives with -31.1 strokes gained total in his last eight starts.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

A $200,000 increase in his salary seems light and Sean was 28th here 12 months ago and in the top 10 at TPC Summerlin on his last visit to the desert. Adam Hadwin ($7.5m) suits PGA West. I wished he had played in Hawaii, but the Canadian fits this tournament perfectly from a statistics angle and he went out in the final group with Dufner and Lovemark here 12 months ago, finishing 6th.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Golfers I Love  Paul Casey ($11,600) – It’s going to be very difficult to fade Paul Casey after finishing no worse than fourth place in each of his last four starts. Last week at the Safeway Open, Casey totaled 109.5 FPTS on his was to a T3. He’s been continually knocking on the door of a win, and I don’t expect that trend to stop this week.
Casey  ->  positive

We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
Bradley  ->  positive

I am looking for him to continue his success this week with another top 10. Jimmy Walker-  Walker has owned this course in recent years with 3 top 12 finishes in the last 4 years, with a T-50 finish last year due to a final round 78, otherwise it could have been another nice result. Last season Walker finished top 25 in par 4 birdie or better scoring, T-17 in birdie average and 46th in strokes gained putting.
Jimmy Walker-  ->  positive

He's played the Open only twice: T30 two years ago and T12 last year. Steve Stricker- $6,900 (150-1)    Stricker hasn't played the Open Championship much the past few years, but his T4 last year got him invited back. Top-25s at the Open used to be fairly regular for the now 50-year-old, including a T8 at Birkdale in 2008.
Stricker-  ->  positive

Bryan  ->  positive

He’s not a scoring golfer which can hurt him on a track with as many birdies as this course sees, but he avoids big numbers and excels at putting the ball in the best possible spots – he ranks 37th in both Par-3 Scoring as well as Par-4 Scoring, but is hurt on par-5s by a lack of distance. Blair is another excellent Bermuda putter (0.869 SG:P) and he does have the ability to go low as shown by his -12 and -10 performances at the Barbasol and Houston Open. Blair makes a fine play paired with an expensive Kevin Kisner, because he may not finish first but he will stay in contention and should be in line for a top-30 finish.
Blair  ->  positive

Spieth/Norlander/Phil/Simpson  ->  positive

Bermuda only serves to enhance his advantage around the greens, as "a good ol' southern boy" who grew up playing on them, and he rates the biggest threat to the front two by some margin in my book. Leishman and Harman have superseded him only because of what happened last week and given the contrast in courses, plus the fact that 17th was a perfectly fair effort from Kisner, I'd prefer to focus on all the other evidence which points towards our man. Third at the TOUR Championship last September and fourth in his only subsequent start of 2017, there's every chance Kisner is up there throughout this week and he's worthy of a decent each-way bet.
Kisner,  ->  positive

I kind of welcome that because I think it would benefit me more for sure." The forecast this week is such that it should separate the men from the boys and O'Hair certainly has the skills to thrive when the trouser legs are flapping. His past course form is patchy but he does have T16 and T18 to his name and T34 last year (ninth after round one) was okay too.
O'Hair  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan is never going to out-drive Dustin Johnson. 2018 Masters Picks — Targets From Each Range  I’ll play the history over recent form and take Spieth as my Masters champion. He has never finished worse than 11th in four career Augusta starts, with a win and two silver medals to his credit.
Spieth  ->  positive

So we've seen an uplift in results with 26th at TPC River Highlands and 17th last week at TPC Potomac. In general DeChambeau is hitting the ball very nicely at the moment with his 300 yard driving game finding plenty of fairways. Ball-striking has also been strong across both of his last appearances.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

The weather looks like it will be perfect this weekend, and I expect the players to take aim. We have a nice field for this event, including top 10 players Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day, as well as some other top 20 players like Paul Casey and Justin Thomas. Given the large amount of par 4s on the course, one of my stats of the week is birdie or better percentage on par 4s.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Na placed third at the CareerBuilder Challenge last season and was 48th in 2015, so there's some course history to examine with him this week. Na's stats also match up well with this course. Although he ranked only 93rd in Par 5 scoring last season, he ranked 2nd in approaches 125-150 yards, 11th in approaches 150-175 yards, and 2nd in SG:App.
Na's  ->  positive

The question is always, will the putter stay hot. If it does this week, Steele could easily take on this loaded field and come out with the big check. James Hahn $7,100 – To say, “Hahn enjoys the West Coast swing,” may be the understatement of the year.
Steele  ->  positive

Value Picks and Sleepers  Rickie Fowler ($8,900)  Rickie Fowler is $8,900. For comparison, Patrick Reed is $9,200 and Brooks Koepka is $9,700 and are both ranked below Fowler in the OWGR. Rickie is a tough book to read.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
Glover’s  ->  positive

It doesn’t hurt that Rahm recently won the Farmers Insurance Open on a course with Kikuyu grass in the fairways and rough and Poa annua greens like the ones at Chapultepec this week. Sergio Garcia ($8,500): Garcia has been very good at the elevation of Crans-sur Sierre: He won the event in 2005 and has finished third, fourth, and sixth in five starts at that track. Garcia’s 67.8 Recent Adj Rd Score is tied for fourth, his 72.6 percent Recent GIR is 15th, and his 16.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for 11th in this week’s field.
Garcia  ->  positive

Sneds has been an ever present at Augusta since 2010 and he will be arguably therefore the most motivated man in the field in Houston this week to get the win to ensure this streak remains intact, and for that reason alone I am happy to roll the dice with him this week. BUD CAULEY – 80-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finished 18th  Like List another player who has been knocking on the door of a maiden PGA tour win for a few years now is Bud Cauley. It’s hard to believe that the Florida native burst on to the scene as long ago as 2011 when he had two top 5 finishes in seven starts on the PGA tour.
BUD CAULEY  ->  positive

Casey then tee’d it up at the CJ Cup finishing T19 and followed that with a T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions, T8 in Pebble and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship where he shot three rounds of 68 or better. Casey then went to Copperhead where he shot a final round 69 to post 10 under in total, one clear of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed. His form at Augusta is excellent with four top 10’s in nine appearances, three of which have been the last three years in a row (6,4,6).
Casey  ->  positive

That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
Sergio  ->  positive

He is seeking his first career win and very well could be in contention this week but it is not needed for him to hit value in DFS as he sits comfortably in the mid $8K range. Top Current Form Targets  Brian Harman  World Golf Ranking (#20)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,500)  FanDuel ($11,600)    His price has reached a new high($7,388 season average in 2017) but for good reason as he has been money this season. It started in the fall swing where he finished T5 at the CJ Cup, 8th at the WGC-HSBC Champions, and T4 at the RSM Classic.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Players I will have no share of. Emiliano Grillo – $9,000  He is becoming a staple near the top of the leaderboard, but I do not see myself owning Grillo this week. For one, I like so many of the other golfers around Grillo, and find myself gravitating towards them.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  negative

And his ownership in these events has been high. McIlroy has been much more valuable with odds of less than 10 percent: In 21 such tournaments since 2014, he has posted 86.4 PPT and a chunky 9.87 Plus/Minus with an amazing 71.4 percent Consistency. For the Masters, Rory currently checks in with the third-highest odds to win (11.8 percent).
McIlroy  ->  positive

Russell Henley, who won here five years ago in his first PGA Tour event, is the only winner since 1996 not to have played Waialae Country Club at least twice previously and he was the first winner in his 20s since Paul Stankowski in 1997. Thomas has since won in his 20s but every winner since Henley has also played here at least twice but course form isn't vital. Gomez's course form figures read MC-67-MC prior to his 2016 victory, when Jimmy Walker took the title the first time, in 2014, his figures read MC-61-32-MC-4-MC-26, and in 2012, Johnson Wagner won with previous course form numbers that read 34-MC-MC-MC-MC.
Thomas  ->  positive

However, if Uihlein is going to pick up a PGA Tour win in the 2017-2018 season, the fall swing season seems like an ideal time to get the job done. Ollie Schniederjans – $8,300  Similar to Uihlein, Ollie Schniederjans has to be one of the favourites to pick up his first career win in the fall swing series. Ollie had a great 2017 season, although it didn’t end quite as well as he had hoped.
Uihlein  ->  positive

He’ll be a great target in gpps this week. Bill Haas ($7,200): Haas is a player I’m very high on this week. He’s made seven straight cuts at Augusta and hasn’t finished worse than 24th here over the last four years.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Jason Dufner … The American version of Westwood in that he also makes his living as a sharpshooter tee to green. With top 25s in his last two starts, Dufner has picked up where he left off last year when he totaled six top 10s. Has five career top 10s in 14 stroke-play WGCs.
Dufner  ->  positive

The Ontario native is enjoying a fantastic rookie season, continuing to pile up FedEx Cup points well after his surprise win at the RSM Classic in November. Hughes has seven other top-25s, including two of his past three starts, and if the Tour Championship started today, he'd be in it, sitting 26th in points. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
Hughes  ->  positive

Waialae this week is a flat course with tiny greens and tough Bermuda grass rough. It plays right into Spieth's hands, which are magical around the greens. Jeff Bergerson: Daniel Berger ($8,800)  We have our first full-field, cut event, which means we need to place a premium on guys who can make the cut and give us four full rounds of accumulating points.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Noren comes here in much better form this time around and could be a huge danger man here. Thomas Pieters 35/1  The big hitting Belgian is playing some decent golf lately and after a great performance here last year, Chapultepec looks like it could really suit his game. Pieters has had a mixed bag of form over the last few months but there has been some decent stand out performances.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

Opening rounds of 67-67 placed Kang in 2nd place here after 36 holes on course debut way back in 2011 and he was still 6th going into the final round. In 14 El Camaleon rounds Sung-hoon has shot in the 60s 9 times and you just get the feeling that Kang is a far more confident player these days. He also finished 6th in the 2015 web.com Mexico Championship so clearly gets on with the country and, if we want more coastal links, his amazing round of 60 at Spyglass Hill in the 2016 AT&T Pebble Beach Invitational should be taken into account.
Kang  ->  positive

The FedEx Cup itself has been won by the Tour Championship tournament winner here every time since 2010. Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Billy Horschel, Henrik Stenson and Brandt Snedeker were all in the top 6 of the FEC standings across the last 5 renewals whilst Bill Haas and Jim Furyk were in positions 25 and 11 respectively in the 2 years prior to that. 12 months ago, Rory McIlroy was he first FEC winner since Bill Haas to not control his own destiny when arriving in Atlanta.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here. "There’s something about that special place that really gets me motivated to play the best I can," he told the Augusta Chronicle.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

It won't guarantee him the FedEx Cup, but it'll put him in position to claim it again if others falter. Michael Collins -- Dustin Johnson ($11,700)  Now that the PGA Tour will switch the nines (finishing the Tour Championship on a par-5 instead of a par-3 at East Lake), expect DJ to be part of the fireworks in the final round since he's got a Sunday scoring average of 68.7. Last year, Johnson dropped a Sunday 64 and in 2013 he shot four rounds in the 60s.
DJ  ->  positive

Importantly, Reavie has been striking the ball extremely well in his last five tournaments; he has made every cut and finished as high as fourth at the St. Jude Classic. Reavie’s hefty 17.5 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks second in this week’s field. The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly.
Reavie  ->  positive

DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th. Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No.
DJ’s  ->  positive

After adding to his soaring P/L with 200/1 each-way tip Scott Stallings last week, Dave Tindall picks out three bets for the PGA Tour's Genesis Open in California...  "A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

If I had to pick one of those venues as the one that correlates best I'd probably plump for El Camaleon. Last year's one - two in Mexico, Pat Perez and Gary Woodland, have both been placed here before and even though the OHL Classic has only been staged ten times in total, we've already had two players win both events, and at a very big price here (Mark Wilson and Johnson Wagner). And it could have easily been three.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Brendan Steele 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Steele has enjoyed a hot start to 2016, and continued that last week with a T20 finish at the Farmers Insurance Open. In six starts this season, Steele has one win and two 6th place finishes. His worst finish this year was 31st at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open.
Steele  ->  positive

There isn't really anything not to like here. Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,300)  FanDuel ($9,400)  Looking at my stats model ranks this week, it was a bit surprising to see Rickie right at the top but digging deeper it makes perfect sense. He ranks Top 20 in all my weighted stats highlighted by a 4th overall rank in SG: APP, 5th in Par 5 BoB%, 3rd in Bogey Avoidance, and 3rd in Sand Save %.
Rickie  ->  positive

Here are five golfers to consider for this week's card. Charley Hoffman - You can find Charley Hoffman with odds of +2500, which is a steal given his history at the Valero Texas Open. Hoffman not only won this event last year, but he had a top-five finish in 2013 and was a runner-up in 2011.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

He has a Recent Scrambling percentage of 69.2, which could come in handy at Firestone. Again, I would be surprised if any golfer exceeds 30 percent ownership — even DJ or Spieth — but Hoffman will likely be the chalkiest value golfer of the week. The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance.
Spieth  ->  positive

Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Adam Scott ($12,200)  We thought that Scott would be less great without the long putter. Proving that length isn't everything, he leads the Tour in strokes gained, putting.
Scott  ->  positive

Francesco Molinari is made for this type of event That lack of obviously compelling recent form has protected his price a little and if you can get 66/1 or bigger, he looks rock solid. There are no excuses on that score now returned to Florida, where he's also built up a fine record in the not dissimilar PLAYERS Championship as well as here at Bay Hill.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

Steele value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/5zPyi8BEyX

This preview will look at all those available for the official European Tour fantasy game. Last 10 PGA Championship Winners  2016 Jimmy Walker (Baltusrol) - 14  2015 Jason Day (Whistling Straits) - 20  2014 Rory McIlroy (Valhalla) -16  2013 Jason Dufner (Oak Hill) -10  2012 Rory McIlroy (Kiawah Island) -13  2011 Keegan Bradley (Atlanta Athletic Club) -8  2010 Martin Kaymer (Whistling Straits) -11  2009 YE Yang (Hazeltine) -8  2008 Padraig Harrington (Oakland Hills) -3  2007 Tiger Woods (Southern Hills) -8  Quail Hollow Top 5s  2016 James Hahn, Roberto Castro, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Andrew Loupe, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson  2015 Rory McIlroy, Patrick Rodgers, Webb Simpson, Phil Mickelson, Robert Streb, Gary Woodland  2014 J.B.

Points, Webb Simpson, Ben Curtis, Lee Westwood, Ryan Moore  The winning scores read: -9 (Hahn), -21 (McIlroy), -14 (Holmes), -8 (Ernst), -14 (Fowler).
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
Day  ->  positive

I think he makes a great play to build a cash game lineup around under $10K and I am banking on his large jump in salary to help keep his ownership down in GPP's this week. Kevin Chappell  World Golf Ranking (#26)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($9,300)  FanDuel ($8,000)    Looking at the new average DraftKings points tab on the cheatsheet we see Kevin Chappell's name right there at the top. Since missing the cut at the Genesis Open back in mid-February, Chappell has made every single cut(not counting non-DFS, team-even Zurich Classic) and has scored 50+ DraftKings points in all nine tournaments.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

He came T7 here last season after his T17 finish in his debut. Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

He's also had a chance to win here, leading through 54 holes in 2016, and one of the more powerful players on the circuit is clearly advantaged by a relatively low-scoring test on a par 72 which doesn't punish his wayward driving. Although this is far from an all-out slug-fest, Houston is set up to mimic Augusta and that means little in the way of rough, so providing Lovemark can stay out of trouble the strength of his approach play and improvements in his short game should be allowed to shine. In terms of recent form, he's contended twice this spring - sixth at halfway at Riviera and then leading the field through 36 holes of the Honda Classic - and he's done some good work through the middle rounds on less suitable golf courses in his two subsequent starts.
Lovemark  ->  positive

He also fits the stat model in a big way as he ranks #1 on my sheet in Driving Accuracy, 9th in Strokes Gained: Approach, 2nd in Good Drive %, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, and 6th in Bogey Avoidance. On top of all that, after a disappointing T74 here in 2015-16 Reavie bounced back and finished with a Top 5 last year. Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#10)  Vegas Odds (10/1)  Draftkings ($11,800)  FanDuel ($10,300)    Making his first trip to El Camaleon and the OHL Classic, Rickie is the favorite to win and like I mentioned in the intro, is the only Top 10 player in the World Golf Rankings in the field.
Reavie  ->  positive

Anytime you can get the #1 player in world with a $1600 price decrease and projected lower ownership(in the top tier at least) you have to consider it in tournaments. Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Justin Rose  World Golf Ranking (#12)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)    He was the highest owned player last week and seen a $800 price decrease but I have a feeling he will be a lot less owned this week. He disappointed for the most part at Pebble Beach finishing with a T39 and ranked 43rd overall in DraftKings points.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

White Sulphur Springs provided a relatively benign test of golf with plenty of guys throwing out some very nice rounds on Old White. Overall, our picks were reasonably solid – we had a couple of very frustrating busts (Kisner, Ollie, Thornberry) but had nice results from guys like Nick Taylor, Danny Lee, and Jimmy Walker who performed quite nicely over the course of the week. We’ve still been slumping a bit overall, but I think we are firmly on the road to recovery now going into the ultimate PGA Tour Summer season scorefest.
Nick Taylor,  ->  positive

@DFSDiez @FantasyGolfMan Another good one to add to my list. Bozzelli finished 13th on the https://t.co/29SnY9yKZ0… https://t.co/f1oGgjugFD
Bozzelli  ->  positive

Moore ranked 34th for DD and 12th for DA. Jordan Spieth, who is missing the tournament for the second year in-a-row, has won two of the last four renewals because he's scrambled and putted brilliantly and Moore ranked first for Scrambling and sixth for Putting Average, but the secret to success here is usually relentlessly finding the putting surfaces. Greens In Regulation is the most important stat but how you play the par fives is key too.
Moore  ->  positive

Opens. -- Matt Barrie  DraftKings value picks  Matt Kuchar  Kuchar is always a cash game play, especially at this price, but I really love how he's missed only one cut in a U.S. Open and Open Championship in the last six years. Ironically, he also owns only one top-10 in each of those majors during that same time span, so I'd stick with him in cash games and let others fall on the sword in GPPs this week, because he's sure to be chalky.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Statistically Rose ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 49th in GIR, eighth in scrambling, 13th in SGP and sixth in par 4 scoring. After coming agonizingly close to victory last year, Rose will be keen to try and put that right this year and should be right in the thick of things come Sunday. Phil Mickelson 16/1  The two-time Masters champion returns to Augusta National in great form after a T24 in Houston after an impressive final round 67.
Rose  ->  positive

In more than half of his seven visits he's been a definite factor and as we've seen since he won the second renewal to be played at this golf course, an affinity for the layout has been an absolutely key pointer towards success. What's more, Steele happens to be one of those players who really comes alive when returning to one of his favourite tracks. His other two PGA Tour victories have both come at Silverado, home of the Safeway Open; four of his best 20 performances in terms of world ranking points have come at TPC Scottsdale in the Phoenix Open; three visits to Paris and Le Golf National have resulted in finishes of seventh, seventh and sixth; twice he's gone close at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Steele  ->  positive

On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
Fowler  ->  positive

He's the FedEx Cup playoff leader heading to the Deutsche Bank Championship, which starts Friday at TPC Boston. Rickie Fowler is the defending champion in a tournament Jason Day just loves. For GNN Plus subscribers, you can access our NEW searchable database of PGA Tour results from 2011-present, our top-15 finish chart and season-long trends on DraftKings valuations.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

If players can take advantage of the par fives they can see themselves in contention and you can see yourself in contention in DFS Contests. For reference, last year Dustin Johnson came second in the tournament losing by a stroke to Jhonattan Vegas. DJ was -11 for the tournament and played the par fives at -13 with 2 eagles for the week.
DJ  ->  positive

Take the 30/1. Another of the plethora of players to finish T5 last week was Johnson Wagner and that makes him interesting at 100/1 here. That top five marked a real return to form after a string of missed cuts although T43 at the previous week's Travelers Championship did included an opening 64 to suggest something was brewing.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!
Kirk,  ->  positive

Pinterest Sam Greenwood/Getty Images  Other than that, nothing too egregious from the professor. Finau and Haas are solid, safe picks. Finau's quietly put together a strong campaign, ranking eighth in strokes gained: tee-to-green and fifth off-the-tee, and though he hasn't posted many top-10 finishes, Haas has been a top-25 machine in 2017 (11 in 17 events).
Haas  ->  positive

Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best. A T11 finish at Augusta, following an improved performance in the Match Play give reason to believe Koepka can contend again. He has shown it for two rounds at the Phoenix Open, Bay Hill and the WGC down in Mexico, but struggled to put a full week together.
Koepka  ->  positive

He also finished T9 at the Frankie Templeton Shootout, but as this is an unofficial event it seems silly to count it. Whilst Berger has hardly made a blistering start to the season, it has been steady enough and I am hoping he will build on that T7 finish last time out. On his debut at this event, Berger finished 2nd (lost in a play-off) to Padraig Harrington back in 2015.
Berger  ->  positive

Of course there have been changes made and like the rest of the field this will be new to him, but course form should still hold up to a certain extent this week, especially if a player is in form, which Fowler is. Fowler has five top-10’s in his last seven starts and also won the Honda Classic back in February, so it has been another memorable season for the young American. He needs to get a major win to really put himself at that next level and given how close he has come on numerous occasions, it would take a brave man to bet against him, each time he pegs it up at any one of the four.
Fowler  ->  positive

After regaining some self-confidence, look for Bubba to start posting some low numbers starting this week at Innibrook, a place where he has posted a top 3 before. Others to Consider: Charles Howell III ($9,400), Bill Haas ($9,200), Webb Simpson ($8,500), Graham DeLeat ($8,400), Tony Finau ($7,700), Chris Kirk ($6,900)  Player projections, stats models, DFS lineup builders and much more!

1pt each-way Xander Schauffele at 125/1 Bet365 He shouldn’t be underestimated. Schauffele is a terrific driver of the ball, 19th in driving distance and 30th in strokes gained off the tee and his game reminds me past champion Keegan Bradley.
Schauffele  ->  positive

The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
Fowler  ->  positive

With only 15 tags on FanShareSports, he has the third fewest out of anyone priced above $9K. Hoffman’s recent form is incredible, with an 8th place finish at the U.S. Open followed by a T3 at the Travelers. Maybe it only took a couple weeks off to forget what Charley has been up to?
Charley  ->  positive

Scott Brown – $9,800  Scott Brown is drawing a lot of attention from the DFS golf world this week, being tagged the 4th most on FanShareSports.com. Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events.
Brown  ->  negative

There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event. Barring another withdrawal, which seems very unlikely, Murray should get back right on track at this easy course. As with most players down in this price range this week, Murray isn’t a statistical beast, but he is a good birdie maker, ranking 66th in birdie or better percentage this year.
Murray  ->  positive

For a player that excels off the tee, it’s no surprise that he’s performed well on some of the tighter tracks on Tour this season. With his distance (3rd, 11th SG: OTT) and strong control with his irons (49th SG: APP), List has had an easy time of scoring this year which is always a strong consideration at birdie courses: List sits 21st in birdie average (4.13/round), 26th in Birdie or Better % (23.17%), and his average approach distance when making a birdie or better is 189.2 yards – great for this course. His putter remains the biggest question mark.
List  ->  positive

Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner. Watson made the knockout stages at the Dell Matchplay, played nicely at the Shenzhen International before a final round collapse and then landed 5th at TPC Louisiana with partner J.B. Holmes. But it was at Muirfield Village where Watson really came to the fore for me this week.
Bubba  ->  positive

Holmes  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Jordan Spieth – $11,500  WGC events provide us with plenty of options at the top of the DraftKings pricing. In a field this small, it is impossible to fade any of them if you are building multiple lineups.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Hero Chall Picks D Johnson 7s 3pts Win B Koepka 12s 2.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4 [as advised y/day] K Kisner 33s 1.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4
Johnson  ->  positive

Prior to that, Casey had started the season with back-to-back top-10 finishes and he looks exactly the right type of player for this test based on last year's leaderboard, one he worked his way up with rounds of 67 and 66 over the weekend - one better than DJ, one worse than Fleetwood, and third in the field. Paul Casey is all smiles at present  His record in WGCs last year read 16-9-5-11 and in an event where the ball-strikers may once again dominate, he's the only player in this field bar DJ who currently sits inside the top 10 for strokes-gained tee-to-green and has also done so at the end of every year since 2015. It's no secret that Casey is among the world's best in that regard and of course the issue is that it's almost 10 years since his sole success on the PGA Tour, but with the Ryder Cup once again on the agenda and having turned 40 last year, it wouldn't surprise me if he ended that drought in the near future.
Casey  ->  positive

Both have put better of late and have much to prove after slow starts to 2017. Other potential targets for large tournaments this week include Emiliano Grillo ($8,500), who was in the mix here last year, Danny Lee ($7,500), who is coming off two straight top-10s and Jamie Lovemark ($6,300), see my comments below. Sean O’Hair also deserves a shout out after landing two top-5 finishes in a row and being in a lot of winning tournament lineups last week.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament. A justifiable concern.
Streelman  ->  positive

Bill Haas – Play  I really like Haas this week and will be putting him into a few GPP lineups. I think Haas falls into the middle of the pack ownership wise and I am comfortable being overweight on that number. If he can straighten out the drive Haas is a player I think sets up great for when winds pick up as he can stay in contention in the rough weather through his scrambling ability.
Haas  ->  positive

His rank of 109th in Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee is also worrying, but he still a man for the big occasion. Spieth’s lacklustre figures in Putting and Off the Tee are slightly negated by his hugely impressive Approach-the-Green (1st) and Tee-to-Green (10th) numbers. Spieth also ranks 4th in Par 5 Scoring Average which may well come into play at this Par 72 track.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

Scott will likely be my one-and-done pick this week as he has gone T-2, T-10 and T-17 in last three tries at Riviera. If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk.
Scott,  ->  positive

In this article we give you our top value plays and sleepers for the week on DraftKings. Top-Tier Plays  Paul Casey ($9,500)  Paul Casey at this price is mind boggling. He finished 2016 as the hottest golfer not name Matsuyama and he has begun the new tour season where he left off, placing 12th, 21st and 3rd in his first three events.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

In an interview with Sky's Rob Lee he spoke of how he needs to sharpen up his work on and around the greens but that he was happy with his game as we approach the US Masters. Spieth led here with a round to go two years ago before being beaten by Holmes in the playoff so I imagine this home state event is one he's keen to win but at the same time, next week is of far more importance and it's hard to go backing any of these short-priced players with confidence. But for a few holes on the front-nine in yesterday's final, Jon Rahm played brilliantly at last week's WGC Match Play.
Holmes  ->  positive

I’m thinking the odds are in his favor. Sergio Garcia… Much like Fowler, he’s elite when it comes to playing in the elements. It’s no wonder he’s pieced together 10 top 10s in 20 Open Championship appearances.
Fowler,  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – DEAN & DELUCA Invitational  Lock of the week:  Sergio Garcia $10,800 – We absolutely love Sergio this week on a course that should set up well for a tremendous ball striker like he is. Strokes Gained off the Tee and Strokes Gained Approach are two of our favorite stat categories this week and Garcia is amongst the top 20 in the field in both. The Spaniard faltered a little on Sunday last week but had a tremendous back nine 29 on Saturday and is still on a heater coming off that Masters win in April.
Garcia  ->  positive

I am going with a guy who seems motivated again, was in the mix two weeks ago in San Diego, and loves Pebble Beach, having won here before. When Snedeker won this event in 2015, he had kind of fallen off and was becoming a forgotten player. He was not qualified for the Masters, which we all know is his favorite tournament.
Snedeker  ->  positive

That's really all you need to know as far as analysis on him as he's been good outside of the US for the past two years, has posted back to back sixth-place finishes in Euro Tour events and has three top 10s in his last four appearances here -- translation: he's a great value play this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day. In the shorter term though I feel a big week could be in the offing for him at the Valspar.
Moore  ->  positive

He could be interesting at 125s. Shock Pebble Beach star Ted Potter Jr (125s) could ride the wave while Koreans KJ Choi (T26 at Pebble and brilliant record here including T5 in 2016) and Players Championship winner Si Woo Kim (68 in R2 last year despite MC) could also feature. Back up the price grid and Brendan Steele at 50s is a decent price in his home State and on greens he grew up on and I really like Alex Noren on this course which is perfect for his left-to-right ball flight but we've really ducked him at 35s.
Choi  ->  positive

Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
Kuchar  ->  positive

He ranks within the Top 40 in birdie or better % and in Par 5 scoring. Brandt Snedeker ($7,700) – Brandt Snedeker’s last few years have been marred by injury. Time and time again he keeps coming back and proving he’s still got game, only to come down with a new injury.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Shell Houston Open - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jon Rahm 2.5pts EW 11/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds:  If any player in the top bracket has the will and determination to succeed this week then it's Jon Rahm and for me he's always 100% committed to the cause, every event he tees it up at, so I don't see his mind wondering towards Augusta this week. His consistency has been amazing since he hit the PGA Tour scene, but it's worth remembering that 'Rahmbo' spent 60 weeks as World Amateur Number 1 and just a look at his amateur history shows multiple back-to-back wins and a level of top 10 result consistency which indicated that the man from Barrika, Spain was likely to be special.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Ben Martin has local ties and a win at Victoria National to his name, while Jonathan Randolph has twice been runner-up at the latter and arrives on the back of a couple of positive performances in Puerto Rico and Texas. However, last on my list is Patrick Reed, who is big enough to chance at 55/1. Reed has endured a pretty miserable spring, but he sounded bullish in the run-up to the Texas Open and started brightly there, before stumbling at the end of the first round and somehow missing the cut after a poor second.
Patrick Reed,  ->  positive

Lee is above average in each Birdie or Better category and is 36th overall in 2017. Though it’s difficult to predict, Lee is also one of the better putters on tour as he’s 36th in Strokes Gained: Putting this year. Chris Stroud ($6,800) and Robert Garrigus ($6,600) are interesting bargain plays this week.
Lee  ->  positive

In Houston he led the SGTTG, SG approaches to the green and total birdies and was in the top 5 in GIR and putts per GIR, which are very favourable stats coming into this week. Despite missing the cut last year, Fowler has played well here finishing fifth in 2014 and 12th in 2015. He ranks 20th in GIR and ninth in strokes gained putting this season, two important stats for the lively greens of Augusta National.
Fowler  ->  positive

Look for Phil to dominate those two tracks and be in prime position Sunday to take home his first trophy in over 4 years. Mid Tier  Chez Reavie ($8,800 – DraftKings, $9,400 – FanDuel)  Chez again? Yes, Chez again.
Chez  ->  positive

DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
DJ’s  ->  positive

2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 101st, Round 2: 16th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Brian Harman: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 3rd, Round 3: 1st. 2013 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 64th, Round 2: 19th, Round 3: 9th.
Brian Harman:  ->  positive

So 66/1 about a player who finished 7th at the Sentry Tournament of Champions, where he shot 2 Eagles and 20 Birdies in 20+ mph winds, at a tournament which he won in 2011 seems a little on the generous side to me. A ball-striker by trade, Vegas has always been happy on the west coast and winning scores of -27/333 and -21/267 across 2 of his 3 PGA Tour victories tell you exactly where he is at when it comes to resort course style birdie blitzes. Wins here at PGA West and twice at Glen Abbey have featured Jack Nicklaus courses and 5th at TPC Louisiana (2016) and 7th at TPC Sawgrass (2012) also highlight that he can play more than adequately on Pete Dye designs with a little space to work with.
Vegas  ->  positive

Gary Woodland – $7,800  I guess I will never understand the Gary Woodland love. At $7,800, I’d expect at least solid recent form or course history, but Woodland has neither. Woodland is a sporadic golfer who can sometimes put together a solid round of golf or two and sneak inside the top 20.
Woodland  ->  negative

However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
Hatton  ->  negative

One To Swerve  Of the elite, I’m not really convinced that Henrik Stenson is playing well enough and his record in this event is modest. I’ll reveal my full line-up in Tuesday’s Playing The Tips feature. Does he have the calmness needed for this event?
Henrik Stenson  ->  negative

He also led the tour in GIR last season and ranked ninth in rough proximity. Glover is in prime condition and is looking like this may be the season he will get his first tour title since 2011. Ollie Schniederjans ($6,300)  Schniederjans spent 42 straight weeks as the World's No.
Glover  ->  positive

Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
Patrick Reed.  ->  positive

Martin hasn’t missed a cut since the RBC Heritage in April, including a T5 at the Quicken Loans National and racked up 21 birdies at The Barbasol Championship last week in route to a T6 finish. Just below the average price on DraftKings means Martin will be a lock for us in all formats. Chad Campbell $7,500 – “Big Tex” Campbell has been bringing the heat lately on the PGA Tour with five T20’s in his last seven starts.
Martin  ->  positive

He also shares another compelling fact with Reed from last year: with 7 top-10s in 2017, Charley is the highest player in the FEC not to have won this season. If there was an award for most improved player in 2017, Hoffman would have to be the winner after being 74th in the Official World Golf Rankings in February. From there 4th at Riviera and 2nd at Bay Hill powered him onto the fringes of the Presidents Cup conversation and he then proceeded to seriously contend at Augusta National leading after 36 holes and going out on Sunday in the second last group before fading.
Charley  ->  positive

This also comes off his 3rd place finish last weekend at the Wyndham Championship. With his strong form, history of playing well in the FedEx Cup, and his putter that can carry him through an event, Snedeker is an excellent play in tournaments this week, and you should be able to get him at a low ownership. Kevin Na ($7300)  He’ll be chalk.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Best part about all of this is that he is priced right below Luke List who will soak up a ton of ownership. Matt Kuchar – $9,100  Kuch hasn’t been Mr.Reliable lately, failing to record a top 25 in his past four events, with the other three falling outside the top 40. He was heavily owned in Mexico where he came a disappointing T58.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

His record at the PGA is more spotty, but Johnson is simply playing too well to bypass, especially at the this price. Francesco Molinari - $6,800 (80-1)    As a member of the PGA Tour this season, the Italian has 12 top-25s in 17 starts and sits an impressive second in strokes gained approach, third in tee to green. Molinari is eighth in driving accuracy, and usually you have to be a real short hitter to rank so high.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Kevin Streelman 1.25pts EW 45/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Kevin Streelman is always a dangerous player on any low scoring course where outright power is not the be-all and end-all. On a great run of form across his past 4 events which reads 18(Colonial)-13(Muirfield)-8(TPC River Highlands)-17(TPC Potomac), Streelman has a host of top results across resort-level scoring assignments.
Kevin Streelman  ->  positive

Also, look for me on Twitter (@DFSBenj), where I'll be providing much more PGA and MLB daily fantasy content. Key Stats:  Ball Striking  Strokes Gained Tee to Green  Par 4 Scoring  Strokes Gained: Approach  Strokes Gained: Putting  Greenbrier Classic Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Bill Haas (DK: $10,800, FD: $8,800)    Weak field events are Haas’s jam, and we get another one this week. Haas enters the Greenbrier in good form, as he’s made four straight cuts with no finish worse than 25th.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

1pt each-way Kyle Stanley at 200/1 Sky Bet (7 places; 1/4 odds) Stanley won’t be able to win on ball-striking alone but there are signs of improvement on the greens. A course record of MC-33-71 is slightly underwhelming but he finished T5 on the adjacent Dye’s Valley course in the 2015 Web.com Tour Championship.
Stanley  ->  positive

A big-hitter who finally saw his hard work in the off-season rewarded with a top-10 finish at Pebble Beach last week, Rodgers looks an interesting each-way player - particularly if he continues to putt well. Truth be told, you can get away with putting badly here - James Hahn ranked 50th when victorious and Johnson, beaten in the play-off, was 55th - so the focus is very much on ball-striking, which leads me to Luke List. This huge-hitting underachiever looked like he might finally prove himself capable of winning at PGA Tour level when contending on a number of occasions last year, always powered by his trademark length off the tee married up with quality iron play.
Luke List.  ->  positive

5. Rafa Cabrera Bello - This field has a strong international presence, and RCB has been playing well across the world so far in 2017. 6.
Cabrera Bello  ->  positive

RFO - Jeremy Chapman - @THEPLAYERSChamp 2.5ew Garcia 18-1; 1ew Thomas 35-1, Matsuyama 25-1; 0.5ew Chappell 60-1, Fowler 22-1, Scott 45-1
Chappell  ->  positive

So too does El Camaleon, host of the aforementioned OHL Classic, where Piercy finished fourth on his last visit. With the Web.com events held here won in 20- and 24-under, Piercy's birdie-making ability is a further boost and he's by some way the best in this field for birdie average, both this season and last. His iron play has also been red-hot - again, he's the best in this field with his approach shots - and in 20 rounds this year, only once has he failed to produce good golf.
Piercy  ->  positive

He had though delivered 3 top-9 finishes and a further 2nd in the season prior to winning in Ohio. Last year saw World Number 65 Jason Dufner beat Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar and Justin Thomas to take his 5th PGA Tour victory at 66/1. Jason showed grit and resolve on a fast Sunday golf course, taking on the likes of 54-hole leader Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Thomas and playing partner Rickie Fowler to comfortably win in the end by 3 shots.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk. Kirk is always a solid putter and relies on his irons, so take some GPP shares of Kirk this week.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois. -- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

This has mostly been off the back of some solid ball-striking too as he currently ranks eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 14th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and is also averaging over 300 yards per drive in 2017. In 2011, Stanley famously blew a win at this tournament with a meltdown on hole 18 on the final day, but bounced back the next week to win his first and only PGA Tour event in Phoenix. While I don’t expect him to win, his game is in fine form, and he has the experience and types of stats I want to target this week.
Stanley  ->  positive

Given a large number of those ahead of him in the betting will be using this as a warm up as opposed to going for the win, Henley arguably looks one of, if not the most obvious winner this week. Thomas Pieters 55/1 (MarathonBet, UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Whilst not in the finest form at the moment, Pieters looks an intriguing prospect on a course that he should be able to take advantage of. Pieters’ biggest strength is his length off the tee, but he is also a streaky putter and if he can find his touch on the greens, this test should suit.
Pieters  ->  positive

I’ll roster again this week. Jhonattan Vegas $7,300  Kyle Stanley $7,400  JT Poston $6,600  Hudson Swafford $8,000  Jamie Lovemark $6,800  Ollie Schneiderjans $6,700  I’ve listed the guys above in order that I like them. It should be a very fun week and an important week to watch as much golf as possible so you have a better idea of who is playing well going into next week.
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

Backed Kaymer at 185/1. Poor record here, but playing well and likes the big event. Weather could produce a surprise winner like ZJ in 2007.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Stud Picks  Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Spieth gets the nod over Dustin Johnson this week for me. Both have won on Poa grass this year but Spieth seems the better fit for a new course with apparently very tricky greens and a layout where power off the tee might not matter much. For all Spieth has done he’s actually never won a WGC event so the motivation to get that in his trophy case is there as well, as is the desire to catch DJ in the OWGR.
Spieth  ->  positive

Steele value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt better than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/VxSS9o43Ze
Steele  ->  positive

Looking at his statistics on the year (PGA only, doesn’t include his absurd 6-shot victory at the Irish Open), Rahm crushes in almost every key category:  4 th in Par-4 Scoring / 5 th in Par-5 Birdie or Better %  in Par-4 Scoring / 5 in Par-5 Birdie or Better % 20 th in Bogey Avoidance  in Bogey Avoidance 2 nd in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green 3 rd in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach  in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach 3rd from 175-200 yards / 90th outside 200 yards  The only categories that Rahm has struggled with this year is around the green (109th in strokes gained) and he’s only an above average putter, not an elite putter (59th). Although there are punitive bunkers around the greens, Rahm will still put himself either on the green or in great position so often that he can manage to give a shot or three back with poor sand save efforts. Play him with absolute confidence.
Rahm  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

I am willing to go with the field on this one and play Harman within my lineups. Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week.
Harman  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

The cream of the golfing crop are in Ohio for the WGC Bridgestone Invitational and while Jordan Spieth may officially be just the second best golfer in the world, our Steve Rawlings thinks he'll end the weekend ahead of the rest...  "Spieth's course form reads an improving 49-10-3 and last year's third was particularly impressive given how poorly he was hitting his irons. There were only 58 players in the field 12 months ago, After Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka and Davis Love III had all withdrawn, and Spieth ranked 54 of 58 for Greens In Regulation . He did extremely well to finish as close to the winner, DJ, as he did."
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He had a good week at the Wells Fargo finishing T12 and followed that with a T22 in Sawgrass at The Players, T10 at The Dean and Deluca and a respectable 26th at the US Open in Erin Hills. Most recently Casey has been playing quite solid finishing T5 at the Travelers which included four rounds of 69 or better to post nine under in total. The Englishman had a super week at Royal Birkdale shooting three rounds in the 60’s to finish T11 at The Open Championship.
Casey  ->  positive

Plus, he loves Riviera, with six top 10s in nine starts. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama. Got a little rest after Phoenix, and how can continue his hot ways on a layout where he has had some nice success.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner @ [65.0] If you want another way to eliminate 2013 champ Rose, it's worth noting that nine of the last 10 winners of the US Open hadn't lifted the trophy before. Kisner is 33, world ranked 20th, was T12 in the 2015 US Open, has played in three US Opens, made the cut at Augusta, was T6 on his last start at Memorial, didn't play St. Jude and won the Dean & Deluca Invitational at the end of May.
Kisner  ->  positive

His play so far this year is good enough to land him within the top-60 in every major statistical category. To go with his stellar recent form, Casey has made starts here the last two years and has 17th and second place finishes to show for his work at TPC River Highlands. Stat Rank Driving Distance 58 Driving Accuracy 53 Good Drive Percentage 15 Greens in Regulation 5 Scrambling 9  If you’re looking for an excellent blend of recent form and course history, Brendan Steele ($9,000) is a good option.
Casey  ->  positive

The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four.

Tied 5th last year closing with a 71 to finish two shots behind play-off winner Tony Finau, the wind can be a major factor at the Coco Beach and the former champion plays some of his best golf in tough conditions. Along with his stellar record in Puerto Rico, Brown has posted top 5 finishes at both Harbour Town Golf Links and the Seaside Course at Sea Island. 10th at The Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens last year, he followed that up with a tied 7th place finish at the Valspar Championship.
Brown  ->  positive

Campos very good value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP chart… https://t.co/WCjpND9SuE

Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Should I add anyone else once the market matures I'll update Twitter before the off. Recommended Bet  Chesson Hadley @ 60/1 (Sportsbook)    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
Cook’s  ->  positive

His T4 here in 2016 only his second appearance at this course (T23 in 2011 on debut) but he has also shown form at the OHL Classic (T4 this season) to further justify his chances, so this is not based solely on that one standout performance here two years ago, nor is it about his love for all things Texas. On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title.
Piller  ->  positive

$6,800 for Holmes is just way too cheap, especially when we are (almost) guaranteed 72 holes from him. Holmes is one of the best birdie makers in the field and will be flipping wedges into these greens all week long. He has been playing very consistent golf as of late, and is knocking on the door of a high finish.
Holmes  ->  positive

Walker also played poorly at East Lake which again is a factor. Before that though, Walker had finished T13 at the BMW Championship and 3rd at the Deutsche Bank Championship. The odds are stacked against him but no more so than they were at the PGA Championship and look how well he played that week.
Walker  ->  positive

A performance that would lift a player above the seemingly numerous legitimate contenders at the front of the market. At the Houston Open, Jordan Spieth provided it. Spieth's record at Augusta National is extraordinary.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Stanley still has the stats that will work at Muirfield, so don’t let one missed cut push you off the bandwagon just yet. Pat Perez – $6,800  Now this is a perfect price for Pat Perez. The last couple of events he saw Perez’s price tag creep a little high for my liking, even though he was still playing well and the course fit his game.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

He played well at the Safeway Open finishing a respectable T13 and followed that with a T23 at the OHL Classic. Johnson then travelled to Sea Island for the RSM Classic where he shot 64,67 over the weekend to finish T8 on 13 under par for the tournament so his current form looks decent. Zach has a great record here and really seems to have the game to fit this course.
Zach  ->  positive

The winning score at the Wells Fargo Championship has varied over the years. Most recent winner Jame Hahn took home the hardware with a -9 final score while Rory McIlroy's two wins (-21 in 2015 & -15 in 2010) were the two lowest in the tournament history. With the changes and new challenges presented for this years PGA Championship I am predicting a winning score of -8 to -10 but it will really depend on the weather.
Rory McIlroy's  ->  positive

Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
Haas  ->  positive

Thomas Pieters – GPP – DK: $8600 FD: $8000  One of my favourite plays when there is a no-cut event. According to our VIP Research Station Pieters is first in the field in field adjusted birdie or better%, edging out the aforementioned Justin Thomas. Pieters is not coming into the event in good form but he is one of those players that often finds himself all over the place on leaderboards.
Pieters  ->  positive

He’ll be far lower-owned than he should be after two straight below-average results. Bernd Wiesberger ($7,100): Wiesberger may not win much but at just $7,100 he brings some good momentum and course history this week. Wiesberger has played this course each of the past two years, in varying conditions, and done extremely well placing 34th in 2016 and 22nd in 2015.
Wiesberger  ->  positive

He’s due for a breakout on the North American stage, and perhaps a trip to Mexico is all he needs to get the monkey off his back. Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil.
Noren  ->  positive

Look for Donald to make a statement in this event that he’s ready, willing, and able to start to reclaim his place in the sun. One from the Rough (Sleeper)  Hiroshi Iwata  He was in contention a few months ago at Pebble and almost captured his first PGA Tour win. After his big performance, Iwata registered back-to-back missed cuts, but his play is one that could be a great fit this week in Puerto Rico.
Iwata  ->  positive

DraftKings-wise, Fowler always makes a good play in the same vein as Lefty, because he makes lots of birdies. On par-5s, Fowler’s made Birdie or Better a whopping 55.83% (4th), and his overall birdie average of 4.44 is currently 4th on Tour. When going for the green, there’s no one better than Fowler who’s circled his scorecard 75.91% of the time he’s gone for it – tops.
Fowler  ->  positive

His good friend, Harry Diamond, will take over the reins for now so all we can do is wait and see but in the short term at least, from a punting perspective, yet another disruption has to be viewed as a negative. Selections  I was more than happy to take a small chance on Spieth and I'm also playing course debutant, Tommy Fleetwood, whose game has improved inexorably this year. Fleetwood finished 27th at the Open Championship two weeks ago and that was a disappointing effort given the form he's been in and that Birdkdale's his local links but I think that second fact was the big problem.
Fleetwood,  ->  positive

It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day. He doesn’t have the best results at Muirfield, but it seems as though Day has found his old form.
Spieth  ->  positive

There are six Par-4’s between 450-500 yards here at Riviera, and with Reavie averaging 290 yards off the tee this season, his approaches from 150-175 and 175-200 yards this week will be important. Reavie ranks 7th and 9th in approaches from the fairway in these two ranges respectively, further supporting his case this week. Whilst there are obvious question marks about whether Reavie can win, especially in this company, his game is in perfect shape to play this course.
Reavie  ->  positive

'Rahmbo' for me is a future World Number 1 who in all likelihood can win on any course, however 12/1 on a specialised track where experience pays like Colonial holds little appeal. Jason Dufner will be well-backed this week and is the first up for me. Tough, windy conditions will play to his strengths, as will fast conditions if they come into play.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Oppenheim has had moderate success in the fall with two missed cuts, a tied-for-18th finish and a tied-for-34th finish last week, but he had great success in the Web.com playoffs just over a month ago, when he registered two top-fives. Oppenheim should be looking for a big finish this week, given his status, and his recent form suggests this might be the week when he pays off with those willing to ride with him in fantasy. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Oppenheim  ->  positive

Kuchar’s 68.5 LT Adj Rd Score is the best in the field, and he’s tied for second with Brandt Snedeker with 5.3 percent Odds to Win. Kuchar has played in five of six tournaments here and has never finished worst than 25th. He is as close as it gets to a lock for a top-25 finish this week and has the consistency DFS players tend to seek for cash games.
Kuchar  ->  positive

playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
KOEPKA  ->  positive

He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events. Unlike Campbell, List is a bomber: His 309.8-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) ranks seventh in this field, and he made the cut here in his only appearance (2013). List has missed four of his last five cuts, but he finished 17th at the St. Jude Classic.
List  ->  positive

Despite grabbing the lead at the start of the final round, Rose struggled on Sunday, but if there's one thing we have learnt about the Englishman, it's to keep faith with him when he's playing well. Going back to 2012, here are Rose's performances in the tournament prior to the win: 5th, 8th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 22nd, 10th, 1st, 10th. You can add to that a 9th place finish at the Travellers prior to winning that AT&T National at Aronimink in 2011.
Rose  ->  positive

Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts. DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking.
Bryson  ->  positive

I think they cut the water off, and they've done a good job." Webb Simpson (2013) : "I love this golf course because it reminds me of the course I grew up playing. You have a lot of options off the tee and greens are undulating and fast.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Even though it’s a new venue, the fact Berger scored T28 and T17 finishes on his first two visits to this event shouldn’t go overlooked either as I expect Eagle Point to play similarly to regular host Quail Hollow. At $8,300, a second career win isn’t out of the question here for Berger and he could be looked at as an exceptional value on DraftKings. MY SLEEPER : Geoff Ogilvy ($7,200)  I’m going with a pretty deep sleeper this week in Ogilvy.
Berger  ->  positive

Patrick Rodgers is a huge talent capable of going close Rodgers knows he belongs in a higher grade to this one and having won in Colombia on the Web.com Tour, bagged two top-15 finishes in Mexico at the aforementioned OHL Classic and contended all the way by the Pacific Ocean at Torrey Pines, everything looks in place for another step up the ladder. Crucially, the big-hitting 25-year-old looks really confident on the greens and if that continues, it's a matter of time before he's contending as he has done several times, including when second to Bryson DeChambeau at the John Deere Classic last summer.
Rodgers  ->  positive

I'm touting Wes Bryan Come hang in my @PowerHourDFS slack https://t.co/JYS9wono32
Bryan  ->  positive

On top of this all Harman finished T5 at this event at Bethpage Black in 2012 and impressed again four years later, finishing T22 at the same course and event. With the Bethpage Black form behind him and some solid current form, Harman looks good value this week. Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me.
Harman  ->  positive

Confident. Those are five words that I’d use to describe Kevin Kisner’s game and also five words that I’d say are ideal qualities of a player poised to host our nation’s winning trophy. I was actually hoping that he would not win at Colonial a couple weeks ago, as I wanted him to stay extra under the radar heading into this week.
Kevin Kisner’s  ->  positive

After missing the cut on debut in 2011, he has since gone on to finish 38th, 2nd, 69th and most recently 11th here and I expect him to go better this time around. He was unfortunate to lose out in 2015, with Jim Furyk getting the better of him in the play-off after shooting 63 on the Sunday just to match Kisner, who had shot 64 in the final round himself. At 40/1, he looks good value to perform at an event he would have been 25/1 at best to win in the past, now he’s rounding into some good form once again.
Kisner,  ->  positive

Mo Yoshimoto looks at everything you might have missed at Bethpage Black last week in his Barclays Recap. Now for the picks...    GolfChannel.com Fantasy Golf      Ryan O’Sullivan    @RyanGolfBlogger      2016 Earnings: $16,495,565  2016 Rank: 7,854 of 41,730    Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Charley Hoffman  Group 4: Sean O'Hair      ANALYSIS: Fowler, Day, and O'Hair were all right in the mix last week at Bethpage Black. Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston.
Fowler  ->  positive

Kevin Na at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - chance to prove a point dropping in distance from the US Open  1pt e.w. Bud Cauley at 60/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - close to a win and has some very solid form here  Our fully transparent tipping record can be found by clicking here . The introduction of strokes-gained data has revolutionised golf, in the same way that it once revolutionised baseball and will gradually do the same in every sport where there are millions at stake.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
Stenson  ->  positive

Geoff Ogilvy  3. Jordan Spieth  MY PICK : Louis Oosthuzien ($9,100)  Oosthuizen started the playoffs strong last week with a T10. While he was somewhat wild off the tee at Glen Oaks, Oosthuizen’s approach game was on point as he gained over 4.2 strokes on the field in approaches and was T3 for the week in Greens in Regulation.
Louis  ->  positive

It's a great venue for him to keep his hot play going and I'm happy to get involved at 35/1. Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

Stanley is 5th on Tour in that category which goes along with his 12th ranking in SG: Approach, 6th in SG: Tee to Green, and 7th in Proximity to the Hole. He’s a stud in all facets of the game on his way to the green, which is the one spot where he falters – Stanley sits 175th on Tour in SG: Putting, and concerning is that his worst putting has come on Bermuda this season. All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he’ll be in contention.
Stanley  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Dustin Johnson  Vegas Odds - 9/1  Draftkings - $11,300  FantasyAces - $6,100  DJ is starting to trend in the right direction after an 18th at the Barlays and a T8 last week at the Deutsche Bank Championship. His finish could have been better or worse depending on how you look it.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Australian Number 2 Day also won at Conway Farms in 2015 and naturally the former World Number 1 has a win (2015) and 2nd (2014) to his name here on the Pacific coast. Other results across Leishman's CV also link inexorably to Woods - and that is clearly never a bad template. 4th at Augusta (TW 4 wins), 5th at Muirfield Village (TW 5 wins), 2nd at St Andrews (TW 2 wins), 8th at Congressional (TW 2 wins), 3rd at Firestone (TW 8 wins) and 2nd at Cog Hill (TW 5 wins) certainly paints a picture.
Leishman's  ->  positive

Another top-10 finish is not out of the question. This Dude Likes Legos  Zac Blair is not in fine form — his 71.2 Recent (Rec) Adj Rd Score ranks near the bottom of the field — but he has the type of game to get around what’s expected to be a tough course. Blair’s 68.3 LT DA percentage is second in the field, and his 60.1 LT SC percentage ranks 15th.
Zac Blair  ->  positive

He ranked 11th on the Par-5’s and 25th in Putting, so should his putting pick up slightly, he can look for another big finish this week. Sitting at 51st in the World Rankings, Kizzire will be looking to crack the magic number this week, and will also want to reclaim top spot from Justin Thomas in the FedEx Cup rankings. He is currently just 259 points shy of Thomas, with both posting two wins and four top-10 finishes so far this season.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend. Although this is his first appearance here in Bethpage, Grace ticks a few key boxes here ranking fourth in SG approach to the green, ninth in SGTTG and 19th in par 4 scoring.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

It took a final round 68 to shoot up the leaderboard here last year, but 74 was his worst round of the week showing he played four pretty steady rounds on this tough course. With soft conditions possible, after heavy rain Monday which may be followed with more on Thursday, Holmes’ distance off the tee could be vital. Holmes missed his first cut since last August in Houston last week, but he wasn’t alone, with players such as Spieth, Adam Scott and Patrick Reed also missing the cut in what was a strange, weather-affected Houston Open.
Holmes’  ->  positive

Hadwin lines up well for the par 70 track and does so at a reasonable price on DraftKings. Comparing his Vegas odds to his price point in the VIP PGA Spreadsheet we can see Hadwin is either mispriced by DraftKings or Vegas and I think I know which one is wrong. Nick Taylor – GPP Punt – DK: $6700 FD: $5400  Maybe it’s my Canadian bias coming through but here’s another Canadian that sets up for any par 70 course.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Casey checks the box in several categories we are diving into this week ranking 21st in SG: Approach, 8th in Scrambling, and 58th in Par 5 Scoring. I expect Casey to carry the momentum from The Master’s into Eagle Point and hopefully finish near the top of the leaderboard. Francesco Molinari ($15,300) – Francescooooooooooooo.
Casey  ->  positive

If he can get the flat stick working, look for his name at the top of the leaderboard Sunday. Others to Consider: Rickie Fowler ($12,000), Chad Campbell ($7,600), Peter Uihlein ($7,200), Cameron Percy ($7,000), John Huh ($6,800), Luke List ($6,600)  Be sure to complete your PokerNews experience by checking out an overview of our mobile and tablet apps here.

John Huh  ->  positive

He's got 10 million reasons to play well. Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017.
Spieth  ->  positive

Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here.
Reed  ->  positive

I think he has a legitimate shot to win this tournament if he keeps the ball near the hole on his approaches. Daniel Berger is coming off a solid week at the Shell Open and looks to continue his fine play at the Masters. Berge is a solid player in every category, but does a great job on the green which should help him have a strong run at Augusta.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

I don't think he's a bad play here but I have two other options I like. That leaves me with Steele and Hoffman. Hoffman grades out better in total course history, current form, and is only slightly worse in long-term performance.
Hoffman.  ->  positive

He can put this behind him this year though, as he continues to strike the ball beautifully. Of course, Scott’s putter is always going to be a concern but he has finished 13th and 16th in his last two starts whilst ranking 56th and 75th respectively in Strokes Gained: Putting so if he improves even slightly on greens he knows well this week, there’s a good chance he will contend. At this point, you are purely betting on whether Scott can putt even just respectably for four rounds, which at 40/1 I am happy to chance that he will.
Scott’s  ->  positive

Before missing the cut in Perth, Bhullar had finished T27-T10-T27 in his three co-sanctioned events in 2018, so he has been in solid form, which will hopefully continue this week. You can check out Jason’s full double preview here  Steven Gray – Webb Simpson to be the First Round Leader @ The Valspar Championship – 55/1 e/w (Betfair/PaddyPower)  Webb Simpson has been back to his best on the putting greens this year as he ranks 6th in strokes gained: putting so far in the 2018 season. Combine that with his usually accurate tee-to-green game and we might see him win again this year.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Steve Rawlings takes a look at the local challengers at this week's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale...  “This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.“  Three of the first four in the Top GB & Ireland market are English - Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey - but it's now 25 years since an Englishman won the Open Championship so we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Rose, Casey, Fleetwood and their fellow compatriots, even if one of them, Fleetwood, is playing very close to home. Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Recommended Bets  Back Rory McIlroy for Top 5 @ [3.15]  Back Jason Day for Top 10 @ [4.5]  Back Jon Rahm for Top 5 @ [8.2] The sky's the limit for the Spaniard so I'll chance the 8.2 for a top five. Finally, it's time for Jon Rahm to step up and be a force in a major and this long, wet course offers an obvious chance.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
Lee Westwood:  ->  negative

I will be looking at great wedge players and putters to fill my line up this week.

If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

Others: Sung Kang, Zac Blair  High-upside GPP Picks  Zach Johnson ($9,800): Simply put, I don’t think anyone is going to want to pay up to $9,800 to play Zach Johnson this week, despite his great record at this event. Johnson has endured a tough start to 2017 but his form over his last two starts has been much improved. Of note is the fact that even though he hasn’t hit it great in 2017, Johnson’s around the green and putting stats are both still inside the top 50 for the year, two factors which often pay huge dividends around Colonial.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

I think he’s a very solid value at this price. BARGAIN BIN  Charley Hoffman ($6,700) – It seems blasphemous to be hyped about a guy like Charley given how he has treated the DFS community over the years with extreme up-and-down performances, but Hoffman has been absolutely rock steady this entire year, and we know how well he can handle the wind given his exceptional track record at a spot like the Valero as well as his impressive R1/R2 at Augusta. He’s having the best season of his career, and I would expect him to more than deliver on his low price this week.

As always, my best suggestion is to check the weather Wednesday night before making decisions. LAST FIVE WINNERS  2017 — Dustin Johnson -17 (over Thomas Pieters -12)  2016 — Bubba Watson -15 (over Adam Scott -14)  2015 — James Hahn -6 (in playoff over Dustin Johnson and Paul Casey)  2014 — Bubba Watson -15 (over Dustin Johnson -13)  2013 — John Merrick -11 (in playoff over Charlie Beljan)  2012 — Bill Haas -7 (in playoff over Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley)    WINNING TRENDS  Recent form is important this week: Each of the last seven winners at Riviera had placed 29th or better in the week preceding their victory at Riviera. STATISTICS  Strokes Gained: Off the Tee  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Scrambling  Driving Distance (DD) isn’t the be all, end all this week.
Paul Casey)  ->  positive

Factor in driving, and he's 54th in ball striking. Dufner missed the cut two of the past three years, but he's a better golfer now. He notched top-25s in 2012 and '13.
Dufner  ->  positive

I'm working on targeting players who played well on testing, old-style courses in 2017. As you can see, previous winners here have all recorded strong results on classical or technical tracks in the season prior to winning here:  Watson - 3rd Copperhead, 2nd Whistling Straits (PGA Championship)  Snedeker - 4th TPC San Antonio - 1st Harbour Town - 11th Congressional (US Open)  Woods - 2nd PGA National - 1st Muirfield Village - 1st Congressional  Stallings - 4th Colonial - 4th Muirfield Village - 2nd St Jude  Day - 2nd Torrey Pines -4th Pinehurst -2nd Ridgewood - 4th East Lake  Snedeker - 1st Pebble Beach - 8th Chambers Bay (U.S. Open) - 2nd Colonial  Rahm - 3rd Congressional - 2nd Glen Abbey  Bookmaker Offers : Latest offers and extended each-way places are detailed below. Coral have gone 7 places each way at 1/5 odds plus get £/€20 of free bets for new accounts.
Rahm  ->  positive

Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
Lahiri  ->  positive

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
Reed  ->  positive

That would certainly describe Fowler, who also sits 1st in the All-Around stats which measure driving, irons, bunker play, putting, scoring and birdie/eagle ranking. So, could Fowler be the latest to debunk the myth that you have to be a renowned straight hitter to win the US Open? It may be a shrewd move to try and take the counter-intuitive route again and back him.
Fowler,  ->  positive

While I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s a world-class player, he’s definitely a few cuts above his competition here at a very good bargain price. Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events.
Garrigus  ->  positive

Qatar Masters: Smith @55s - 1.65pts e/w #hondaclassic: Kirk @100s - 0.95pts e/w (8 places with Sky)
Kirk  ->  positive

The Swede landed the BMW PGA Championship in May at Wentworth with a stunning final round of 62. This title means Noren has won his last two starts in England, having also been victorious at The Grove last year, which bodes extremely well for this week especially as he has spoken of how much he loves playing in this country. Noren has yet to make a big impact in the majors although he is likely to have positive memories of his appearance at Birkdale nine years ago.
Noren  ->  positive

In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here. Everything is trending in the right direction for Day. Jordan Spieth  Vegas Odds - 12/1  Draftkings - $11,600  FantasyAces - $6,000    Spieth is starting to heat up and is on the brink of winning once again.
Day  ->  positive

Scott Stallings was the 3rd Round leader last week at Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, but as we know closing out PGA Tour titles is never easy and Stallings was treading water on Sunday as Grayson Murray and Chad Collins played some nice golf on the back 9. He still had a chance standing on the 18th tee, but an errant drive delivered a closing bogey and Stallings finished in 3rd spot. But as we've seen from Vegas and many others in the past, when players are playing well they often have bouncebackability.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

1 golfer, Jordan Spieth is clearly one of golf’s brightest young stars. With a win and two third-place finishes in the first two months of 2017, he’s back to looking a bit like the Spieth of 2015, when he won five tournaments including the Masters and U.S. Open. Let’s dive into the numbers of the former Texas Longhorn who is still just 23 years old.
Spieth  ->  positive

He had though delivered 3 top-9 finishes and a further 2nd in the season prior to winning in Ohio. Last year saw World Number 65 Jason Dufner beat Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar and Justin Thomas to take his 5th PGA Tour victory at 66/1. Jason showed grit and resolve on a fast Sunday golf course, taking on the likes of 54-hole leader Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Thomas and playing partner Rickie Fowler to comfortably win in the end by 3 shots.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
Justin Thomas.  ->  negative

A T9 last year, on just his second start at this course gives a lot of hope, and hopefully he can emulate that success this week. Since his T5 in Houston, Berger has finished T27 at the Masters and T36 at the Wells Fargo last week, where he seemingly failed to get out of cruise control. One of the stats which always comes up here, even if it doesn’t rank as my most important is Scrambling and Berger ranks 12th in that area this season.
Berger  ->  positive

Rahm is second to only DJ in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, and currently sits 11th in Carry Distance (299.0 yards) which shows just how long he can hit it; because of his distance, Rahm is a stud on par-5s (T16 in Par-5 Scoring, T3 in Par-5 Eagles). It’s not just the rookie’s game off the tee that sets him up so well here, but Rahm is very efficient with an iron in his hand: 9th in SG: Approach, and from that key 150-175 yard range, he’s hit 70.24% of greens in regulation (34th). He comes with a hefty price and the bitter taste of chalk, but has massive win upside this week.
Rahm  ->  positive

Perhaps with the Open Championship in mind, he'd taken the John Deere off his schedule for the last few seasons but in 2010 he shot bookend 65s to place T7 and the year before was T15 after another 65 on day two. Again, it's easy to baulk at the price of 20/1 but with five top fives this season, Hoffman has given each-way backers plenty of returns and, on current form and with no Jordan Spieth in the field, he must really have a great chance of getting the 'W' this week. Staying at the front end of the market, Kevin Kisner (20th SG: Putting) and Daniel Berger (24th SG: Putting) would have obvious chances at 16/1 ad 12/1 respectively.
Hoffman  ->  positive

With seven each-way places to go at this week, that means he would have landed the cash twice in three attempts. Stenson has actually made the top seven in seven of his last 16 starts in Florida and won the Players Championship in the Sunshine State in 2009 so it's always been a happy hunting ground for him. Looking a little closer at his excellent play here, he's shot over par in just one of his 12 rounds and last year Stenson opened with a 64.
Stenson  ->  positive

While his form at Quail Hollow isn’t spectacular, having only played here once since 2011 (T41 last season), means we can’t really weigh it against him very heavily. Casey has certainly performed well at other longer par 71 and 72 venues, such as Riviera and the Houston Golf Club, and there’s little reason to think Quail’s tougher layout won’t be a good fit for him. From a fantasy perspective, Casey also ranks as one of the better values this week as his $7,800 salary is the lowest it’s been since the Masters; this is despite his streak of constantly returning value, week in week out on DraftKings.
Casey  ->  positive

Two of Piercy's three PGA Tour triumphs have come in 'opposite' events - those held on the same week as a World Golf Championship or major - and this noted opportunist can bag another in the Dominican Republic. While Piercy hasn't played this course in competition, he has been third at designer Tom Fazio's Conway Farms while his love for playing by the coast on paspalum greens is demonstrated by strong form in both the OHL Classic in Mexico and the CIMB Classic held in Malaysia. He calls the Sony Open in Hawaii his favourite event on the schedule and has been runner-up there at a course which, visually at least, shares something in common with this altogether longer layout.
Piercy's  ->  positive

9. Harris English -- English is a former winner here in 2013, and he was T-4 in Vegas, and he's a cut-making machine. Usually good for plenty of points, but hard to recommend for a win.
Harris English  ->  positive

He has shown some great consistency this year finishing T5 at Pebble Beach, T3 at the WGC Mexico Championship, solo second at the WGC Matchplay, T10 in Houston, solo fourth at the Wells Fargo and a T2 at the Dean & Deluca in Colonial recently. Rahm has one appearance at The US Open which was last year in Oakmont where he finished in a respectable T23. Statswise he has the length to score around this course averaging just over 305 yards off the tee ranking 13th in driving distance.
Rahm  ->  positive

With his price, I’d expect high ownership but Finau is not a player I want to fade this week as I think he sets up great for this event. Danny Lee – Cash – DK: $9500 FD: $8400  Last week I picked Danny Lee and discussed how he is the type of player that consistently plays well when he shows good form; this week I see no reason to jump off the train. Lee combines good form with great course history (defending champion) and although he will see high ownership he is a lock for me in any cash game format.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

There is always a chance of a little bit of a hangover or drop-off in performance on the back of such a pivotal victory in Garcia’s career but balanced against that is the fact he is playing some of his very best golf at the moment. Justin Rose, vanquished at Augusta National, and former winner Rickie Fowler are other likely popular picks but I am going to take a chance on a couple who fall very much into the ‘improver’ category at three-figure quotes – Hudson Swafford and Patrick Cantlay. The former has threatened to be a very good player for a number of years and although a relatively late bloomer after his maiden PGA victory this year at the CareerBuilder Challenge, he remains the right side of 30.
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Steve Stricker  The old man still likes to come over to the PGA Tour from time to time when he's not crushing his competition on the Champions Tour, where he has finished second and first in his past two starts. Stricker still makes his way down to Copperhead, as it is a perfect course for his game, as he has made a career of being one of the most accurate players on tour ... who happens to hit a lot of greens and can still putt as well. He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach.
Stricker  ->  positive

He hasn't got a terrific Sawgrass pedigree but that can only go some way to explaining his huge price. Johnson fits the veteran bill nowadays and he's shown form here before when runner-up to Kuchar in 2012, while Walker, who finished sixth here in 2014, is attempting to emulate Day and win this event nine months after winning his first major at the USPGA Championship. Odds in excess of [200.0] were insulting.
Johnson  ->  positive

Top-5 finishers last year:  1.Rickie Fowler  T2.

Rickie Fowler (DraftKings $11,700, FanDuel $12,300: Rickie will look to earn his ticket back to the Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the same way he did last year, by winning the Honda Classic.
Fowler  ->  positive

High-value Englishmen Justin Rose ($9.3m) and Paul Casey ($9.5m) don't make the top 10 of the predictor model either. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Cody Gribble ($6.8m); 2: Daisuke Kataoka ($6.4 m); 3: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 4: Ryan Blaum ($7m); 5: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 6: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 7: Justin Rose ($9.3m); 8: Charles Howell III ($7.8m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($8.3m); 10: Branden Grace ($7.5m). Positives: Ryan Blaum stands out on a FPPG basis, ranking fourth across the Sony field for a mere $7m.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

While not all his stats are strong this year he does rank 1st in strokes gained: putting and 4th in par 4 scoring and I’m sure his whole 2018 campaign so far will have been geared to peaking this week. He is going to win one eventually and having had a light schedule he comes in 100% fit and focussed and that hasn’t been the case with Day too often lately. If he can start well I think he will hang around all week and with generous place terms he looks worth an each way bet as back up to Spieth.
Day  ->  positive

Much to the bemusement of European Tour and Team Europe fans, Casey decided to count himself out of the running for Team Europe at both the 2014 and 2016 Ryder Cup’s. Casey did not agree with the qualifying criteria and would not commit to the required number of European Tour events to make the team. This caused quite a stir amongst the golfing community, as a player of his talent could really help Europe’s cause against the Americans.
Casey  ->  positive

Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

However we do know that Walker comes to the fore on classical layouts and that he loves Poa Annua greens. Walker, like Woods and Snedeker before him, is a natural putter and that works well on these greens. Since 2012, Walker's record at Torrey Pines reads 8th, 4th, MC, 7th and 4th.
Walker  ->  positive

Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.7m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 3: Brendan Steele ($8.2m); 4: Bubba Watson ($8.3m); 5: Ryan Moore ($8.6m); 6: Phil Mickelson ($8.4m); 7: Gary Woodland ($9.0m); 8: Russell Knox ($7.5m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($7.1m); 10: Brooks Koepka ($9.1m). Predictor Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select at $8.6 million and there's more detail on him in the FPPG section below.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Luke List - $6,400 (Field, 4-1)    List was a DFS darling during the fall season, and he notched his fifth top-15 cash of the season at the Sony Open in January. Since then, however, as fields have improved, List has gone T41-MC-MC. Still, he is a big hitter who tied for 20th in his Riviera debut last year, and he has decent GIR and proximity numbers.
List  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

Fleetwood's lead was cut by Sergio Garcia on Sunday and the Englishman is absolutely determined to earn his place in the history books, which he deserves for his performances at all levels throughout 2017. With Garcia not in the field this week my belief that it means more to Fleetwood is strengthened and he could strike a decisive blow. His record at Sheshan doesn't leap off the page but three top-30 finishes from as many visits looks good to me, especially as he was nowhere near the level he's at now.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia and Henrik Stenson are the only qualifiers taking a pass. Last year, Thomas bombed (and finessed) his way to a three-stroke win over Matsuyama. Ten golfers are back from the 2017 field, but only three have played the last two years – Thomas, 2016 champion Spieth and Johnson, who won in 2013.
Thomas  ->  positive

Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title. Finau ranks highly in multiple areas this season, including top-25 in SG: Approach, Par-3 Scoring Average and Par-5 Scoring Average, all key areas this week. The one thing that will hold Finau back this week, and has done so for the majority of the season is his putting.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting. His entire game molds perfectly for Conway Farms, and he’s finished T13 and T16 in his two trips there.
Spieth  ->  positive

Pre-event pick, Scott Piercy, sits tied for 30th and five off the lead and he looks to have too much on his plate but James Hahn is close enough if good enough on -8 and I'm happy I followed Paul Krishnamurty in with his three Find Me a 100 Winner selections. Michael Thompson is alongside Piercy after a disappointing second round but Chesson Hadley and Grayson Murray are both alongside Hahn in a tie for 11th and I'm just going to cheer those on for now. 09:35 - March 30, 2017  A weather delay yesterday morning has meant round one of the Houston Open is yet to be completed and that's always frustrating when trying to assess the state of play.
Scott Piercy,  ->  positive

Time to rebound this week in the desert. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Hideki Matsuyama (T4-T2-WIN-WIN)  J.J. Spaun (T4)  Webb Simpson (6-for-7 with five top 15s)  Rickie Fowler (7-for-9 with three top 5s)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T9)  Byeong Hun An (6th)  Zach Johnson (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Shane Lowry (T6-T16)  Jon Rahm (T5-T16)  Brendan Steele (7-for-7 with five Top 20s)  Phil Mickelson (22-for-28 with THREE WINS)  Kevin Na (11-for-12 with eight top 30s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-8 with two top 10s)  Bubba Watson (9-for-11 with six top 15s)  Daniel Berger (T10-T58-T7)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Matt Kuchar  Justin Thomas  Phil Mickelson  Marc Leishman  Francesco Molinari  Brandt Snedeker  Austin Cook  Steve Stricker  Zach Johnson  Patrick Reed  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, and Daniel Berger.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Could be the recipe for success this week. Mori Yoshimoto  @Bears3423    Last Week: 348.5 points  Last Week Rank: 5,177    Kevin Na ($29,500)  William McGirt ($29,000)  Lucas Glover ($15,700)  Kyle Stanley ($12,200)  Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)  John Peterson ($4,300)    ANALYSIS: Ball-striking is the name of the game here for Mo. If Valspar proves to be a worthy pointer like it often does than Cantlay's runner-up finish there looks even better.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

To take down a tournament, you will have to have the winner, most of the top 5, and everyone else in the top 10. Onto the final picks of this season:  Top Tier  Dustin Johnson (11,700)  DJ comes in with good form, winning the BMW Championship in his last start, and was 8th at the Deutsche Bank the week before. He’s also in the best spot to win the FedEx Cup, with a win or plenty of other scenarios as long as 2-5 in the standings don’t win.
DJ  ->  positive

Mentioned above, this course facilitates its share of low scores, and no one racks up the red better than Thomas, leading the tour in birdie average. I was surprised Berger wasn't on the professor's top 10. He won in Memphis just two weeks ago, and entered the final round at Travelers last year with a three-shot lead before firing a Sunday 74 (which is like an 80 at any other venue).
Berger  ->  positive

My man A. Cook may be worth a bit as well.
Cook  ->  positive

Finally Riviera is intrinsic with Casey, Holmes, Pieters, Schwartzel and Westwood all having top 5 finishes at Hogan's Alley. So Patrick Cantlay ticks many of those course links very nicely. 9th at Pebble Beach (2013) came when Patrick had just turned pro.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Throughout the Euro Tour’s 2017 season, Fisher ranked fourth in GIR percentage and ended sixth in the Race to Dubai. Bargain Bin    Kevin Chappell - $14,100    Not a bad price for someone who ranks fourth on Tour in SG: Tee-to-Green and 10th in scrambling, but he’ll need to improve with the flat stick in order to have any shot at winning this week. Despite his putting troubles, Chappell has managed to finish top-20 in five of his past eight starts due to such quality ball-striking.
Chappell  ->  positive

This season Streelman ranks 11th in total driving, 18th in SG: T2G and fourth in scrambling. Bargain Bin    Dylan Frittelli - $13,400    Frittelli will be making his Valero Texas Open debut this week, but the South African is familiar with the Texan style of golf after playing collegiately as a Longhorn at UT-Austin. The 51st-ranked player in the OWGR doesn’t enter with very inspiring recent form after finishes of T32-MC-MC in his past three starts, but he led the field in SG: Off-the-Tee and ranked 10th in SG: T2G at Harbour Town last week.
Frittelli  ->  positive

He deservedly won Gold, but what makes me think he will continue to play well this week at Bethpage? Well Rose's CV contains 5 'Up-State' wins across Muirfield, Aronimink, Cog Hill, Merion and Congressional. Tough, classical golf courses where he comes to the fore - indeed Justin tops my rolling technical golf course scoring category across the past 5 years ahead of DJ, Spieth (since 2013 only - amazing) and Scott.
Rose's  ->  positive

Jhonattan Vegas,  ->  positive

Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential. He’s a lock.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place. At some point I expect Wes Bryan to bounce back, and why not this week on a course that plays to Bryan’s strengths? Wes Bryan has the game to win an event like this and is going to be my super sleeper to win here  Click To Enlarge!
Bryan  ->  positive

It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey. RESULT: T62  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  We were on board Ollie Schniederjans as recently as Old White TPC and despite a very strange WD there for a scoring card signing infringement, I'm still very much of the opinion that Ollie is a player to watch right now. His last performance at the John Deere Classic was far better as he co-led after shooting a flawless -8/63 on Thursday and backed that up with a -5/66 to get back in contention.
Ollie  ->  positive

There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood – $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan. He was a joy to watch and has the approach game to put him with the World’s best.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  negative

There doesn’t appear to be a huge advantage in stacking tee times at the moment; although, if one of the first two days’ forecasts improves a bit, it might be better to have your player on the South course when the weather is better.

Henley has progressive Masters form of MC-31-21-11 and was T8 in Houston last week. Johnson is a former Green Jacket winner (also T9 in 2015) whose game doesn't look far away after T26 at Bay Hill and T16 in the Valspar. Hadwin has strokeplay form of 6-9-12 and was a creditable T36 on his Masters debut last year.
Johnson  ->  positive

Although his Strokes Gained numbers are uglier than expected, a large part of that comes from the fact that Blair just doesn’t drive the ball far – he’s averaging 271 yards off the tee this season. As a shorter hitter both with the driver and his irons, Blair can’t seem to catch up on the field at longer courses, which on paper makes him look atrocious – but he is deadly accurate, so it’s not all bad. In fact, Blair currently sits 13th in Par-4 Scoring (3.98 average), which is the bread and butter of the week.
Blair  ->  positive

Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Tight with tough to hit greens and penalizing areas around the green. That is not the ideal course set up for List. However, Old White TPC course is.
List.  ->  positive

High-value Englishmen Justin Rose ($9.3m) and Paul Casey ($9.5m) don't make the top 10 of the predictor model either. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Cody Gribble ($6.8m); 2: Daisuke Kataoka ($6.4 m); 3: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 4: Ryan Blaum ($7m); 5: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 6: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 7: Justin Rose ($9.3m); 8: Charles Howell III ($7.8m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($8.3m); 10: Branden Grace ($7.5m). Positives: Ryan Blaum stands out on a FPPG basis, ranking fourth across the Sony field for a mere $7m.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

It’s hard to predict these clusters early in the week but given the aforementioned fact that results will tend to be wide open in an event like this, it may be a good week to go a bit contrarian. One name who catches the eye in that department is Rick Lamb, who at $6,800 has made four of his last five cuts and finished top 20 in three of those same events. Two weeks ago he managed to find himself in contention with a 3rd place finish at the John Deere classic, and we are on a track that plays to Rick’s strength…his cannon.
Rick Lamb,  ->  positive

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 4 Winners:  2016: Justin Thomas (-23)  2015: Justin Thomas (-26)  2014: Ryan Moore (-17)  2013: Ryan Moore (-14)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Par 4 Scoring Fairways Hit GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Justin Thomas ($12,300)  Who else to begin with the two-time defending Champion, Justin Thomas? JT is now the 4th ranked golfer in the world, and it’s largely in part to his terrific summer where he enjoyed a pair of wins at the PGA Championship and Dell Technologies Championship, before a 2nd place finish at the TOUR Championship to earn him the FedEx Cup Title.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

TYLER DUNCAN – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  I mentioned earlier in the preview that this event has graced the Web.com tour for the past two seasons and Duncan is one player who has tee’d it up in both renewals. In those two outings Duncan has finished 33rd in 2016 and 3rd in 2017 and in eight rounds on the course his worst performance is 70. Clearly therefore Tyler has enjoyed his time in the Dominican Republic.
Duncan  ->  positive

Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
Laird’s  ->  positive

He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Scores are incredibly low year-in and year-out. Winning scores are almost always in the 20s-under par and Jordan Spieth even shot 30-under in 2016. The course is candy to a big hitter’s eye as it has big wide-open fairways and a whole lot of elevation change.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He’s an expensive play, but well worth blowing the budget up top for as he looks for a second win. Chez Reavie ($8100): Reavie is currently in the midst of a seven made cut-streak since the Byron Nelson, which includes a T22 in a tough PGA Championship field last week as well as a T4 at the St. Jude Classic back in June. Course history truthers will ignore Chez this week as he’s missed a handful of cuts at this course, but he did finish T9 at Sedgefield back in 2011.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

His play off-the-tee keeps him in the mix almost every week. SUPER SUBS  Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charl Schwartzel        Ryan O’Sullivan (O)    “The Golf Aficionado”    Full Season Points: 4,986  Full Season Ranking: 4,740  Summer Points: 1,282  Summer Rank: 12,643  Group A  Jason Day (3) and Rickie Fowler (4)    Group B  Charley Hoffman (7), Patrick Reed (3), Henrik Stenson (1), and Rory McIlroy (2)    Group C  Louis Oosthuizen (6) and Emiliano Grillo (9)        Mo Yoshimoto    “@BearsGolf3423”  Full Season Points: 4,782  Full Season Ranking: 13,883  Summer Points: 1,159  Summer Rank: 28,589      Group A  Jason Day (3) and Jordan Spieth (6)    Group B  Patrick Reed (4), Henrik Stenson (5), Charley Hoffman (7), and Russell Knox (8)    Group C  Billy Horschel (9) and Emiliano Grillo (10)  ~  Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team each week. This week I will enter the following lineup into the $3 Birdie contest.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

STATS  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Off the Tee  Putting  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Birdie or Better %  Par-5 Scoring  Approach: Outside 175 Yards  Greens in Regulation  Par-3 Scoring  Top-Tier Golfers  Luke List ($9600): Consistently one of the best on Tour from tee to green, List is sure to be a popular pick on DraftKings this year, as he’s having a strong year and his putter is only losing a marginal amount of strokes (-0.051) when compared to years past (-0.426, -0.273 in the previous two years). List finished T3 here last year in shooting -16 over his four rounds and finished T27 in 2016; he did miss the cut with a 77-72 back in 2013, but that’s ancient history for List. This season, List has only missed three cuts (OHL, Sony Open, CareerBuilder) while picking up a whopping seven top-25 finishes in his 14 events.
List  ->  positive

Smylie Kaufman at 500/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - speculative but better on last solo start and may surprise  1pt e.w. Patrick Reed at 55/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - good signs in last two starts and more prolific than most of these  Owing to the fact that regular venue Quail Hollow will host this year's PGA Championship, Eagle Point, on the North Carolina coast, steps in to ensure the Wells Fargo can go ahead as scheduled. Like Quail Hollow, this Tom Fazio design is a relatively meaty par 72 and while seldom do players and officials criticise a venue, the praise for this one has been stronger than usual.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

He's a solid ball striker with balance on length, accuracy and hitting greens. After missing the cut last week, Horschel comes at a nice discount, and in a field this soft, he's a strong bounce-back play this week. Jason Rouslin -- Stewart Cink ($6,900)  Stewart comes home to Sea Island Resort course off back-to-back 15th-place finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
Dustin Johnson...  ->  negative

The former Bama product is playing great golf and I wouldn’t be shy to get some shares in your GPPs this week. Lucas Glover (6,600) – I have been riding the Glove this year and it has paid dividends week to week. The stat machine is ranked 6th in Par 4 scoring, 7th in GIR%, 17th in SG:T2G and 51st in BoB%.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

He ranks 30th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, 52nd in greens in regulation and 41st in birdies-or-better percentage after lining up par breakers with a putter. Hahn didn't crack a top 35 in four previous trips to Houston, but missed only one cut (2016). Aaron Baddeley  Even when he hasn't been in form, Baddeley has always made sense at the Golf Club of Houston because of his phenomenal touch.
Hahn  ->  positive

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley. Winners & Prices : 2016: McIlroy 13/2 ; 2015: Spieth 9/1 ; 2014: Horschel 25/1 ; 2013: Stenson 16/1 ; 2012: Snedeker 40/1 ; 2011: Haas 45/1 ; 2010: Furyk 20/1 ; Average: 23/1. Weather Forecast : The latest weather forecast for Atlanta, Georgia is here .
Spieth;  ->  positive

Bill Haas – $9,100  Boring Bill Haas is flying under the radar once again. Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green.
Haas  ->  positive

16. Other than that, Kuchar has been surprisingly off this year with a T-9 in Phoenix being his only other top 10. Considering he has a win, a fifth and a T-9 at Harbour Town, he's the safest bet for a big week here.
Kuchar  ->  positive

He ranked 50th in putts inside 10', 44th in putts 10'-15', and 30th in putts 15'-20' last season, which makes him one of the best putters within our putting key stat. Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us.
Casey  ->  positive

If he can keep it going on the greens, he very well could win a second week in a row. Like Fowler, Matsuyama has never won a major, but he doesn't carry nearly the baggage that Fowler does. Tier 2 Values    Matt Kuchar - $8,800 (50-1)    While we picked four of the top-5 guys on the DraftKings board in Tier 1, we're dropping way down in price for Tier 2, bypassing the low-$10,000 and all the $9,000 guys, including Brooks Koepka.
Fowler,  ->  positive

Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts. With his mother’s health improved and his own health no longer an issue, Day seems to be playing much freer of late and for that reason alone I’d not be shocked at all if he put it all together here and won his second major.
Day  ->  positive

That could easily change at Firestone however, a course where Rickie has finished inside the top ten on four out of seven visits. Fowler’s last visit to Ohio paid good dividends too when he finished second to Jason Dufner at Muirfield Village, another classic mid-west venue with fast greens. Fowler is fourth on tour in efficiency from 450-500 yards and won’t hate it if this course plays tough again, he’s the best value among the top four this week.
Rickie  ->  positive

Should he straighten out his driver, he looks in good shape. Despite struggling with the driver, Koepka still ranks 4th in Par 5 Birdie or Better and T7 in Par 5 scoring average. As well as still playing the par-5’s well, he has also played the long par-3’s well.
Koepka  ->  positive

His Korean Open title is also interesting as he beat 2-time Major Champion (at the time) Rory McIlroy into second place. Kang can undoubtedly play and he's trending towards a prestigious first victory on the PGA Tour. 2017 has seen Sung-hoon finish 2nd in Houston, where he was pipped by Russell Henley and Kang was also in the heat of the battle at TPC Potomac (the other Steve Wenzloff renovation we have seen in 2017) when a rainstorm and no wet gear destroyed his momentum - he eventually finished 5th.
Kang  ->  positive

So, although this week's first leg is a tournament with a new name and at a new course, we can be confident that the location should suit. Reed's win at The Barclays came at Bethpage State Park last year while his previous top 10 was at Ridgewood. This week's Northern Trust (not to be confused with their sponsorship of the Los Angeles event played at Riviera) heads to Glen Oaks Club - a par 70 that plays 7,350 from the tips.
Reed's  ->  positive

Johnson Wagner sat tied 30th and five back after round one in 2012 but every other winner this century has been within four after day one. Like Gomez, Vijay Singh trailed by five at halfway and by four after round three and they're the only two to be outside the top-ten at halfway and the top-four with a round to go this century. Gomez's eight-under-par 62 was a remarkable final round 12 months ago and yet he still needed extra time to get over the line.
Gomez,  ->  positive

If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
Hideki Matsuyama,  ->  positive

That sounds right up Matsuyama's alley. EXPERT JONATHAN WALL , Equipment Insider LINEUP | BENCH Jordan Spieth  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Adam Scott  Sergio Garcia  Dustin Johnson  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth Spieth will embrace the difficult test this week at Royal Birkdale. Doesn't hurt that he recorded a win in his previous start.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

That added to three top 15s in November so he's playing some good golf. One final mention - Jonas Blixt. The Swede made the top three last year, has won a PGA Tour event in California (2012 Frys.com Open) and cracked the top 20 at Torrey Pines two starts ago.
Jonas Blixt.  ->  positive

Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Chez Reavie and Keegan Bradley await in the group stages with the Thai likely to present the biggest obstacle to progression, however Rahm is a truly world-class player who can bully players in this format and should he make it through to a head-to-head with Rory in the quarter-finals then my money would be on the Spaniard to progress. RESULT: Group Stage  Shubhankar Sharma 0.5pt EW 100/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins. 18+, T&Cs apply*.
Shubhankar Sharma  ->  positive

Broadening the TifEagle link out slightly, excellent performances on the pure TifEagle greens featured at Kapalua, PGA National, Doral and Bay Hill (from 2016 onwards) link in perfectly as well. My selections are as follows:  Brian Harman 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Brian Harman has a decent enough record here and we know that the 33/1-40/1 price point is a sweet spot for previous RBC Heritage winners.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Per ESPN, “The winners of each group advance to a single-elimination bracket on the weekend, with the round of 16 and quarterfinals on Saturday, including live prime-time quarterfinals coverage on network television, and the semi-finals, finals, and consolation match on Sunday, with the finals reaching again into prime-time network television.” With the breakdown in hand, and without further ado let’s dive into our Final Four picks and our cinderella sleepers! MATT’S FINAL 4 PICKS  Dustin Johnson ($11,800) is the number one overall seed, and I can’t imagine him pulling a Virginia and losing in the first round. His group is pretty weak with Kevin Kisner and Bernd Wiesberger not bringing their A game.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Last year's 54 hole leader, Gary Woodland, putted well last week (for a change) but he was very disappointing in round four, soon relinquishing his chance with a bogey at the second and a double bogey at the third and I'm not sure he's especially reliable in-the-mix. Selections  Chesson Hadley came up close for me last week in Vegas and he's worth chancing again at a venue that really should suit given his sole PGA Tour title to date came in Puerto Rico back in 2014. His recent form figures now read a ridiculously good 10-1-2-46-3-2-4 and he's the epitome of a no-brainer bet.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

He then went on to win the BMW Championship at Cherry Hills at 66/1 and then lift the Tour Championship and win the FedEx Cup to boot! Marc Leishman was giving both Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth all they could handle at TPC Boston last Monday, but ultimately - with a 2-shot lead on the 10th tee - the pressure got to him. However from adversity we've seen players blossom and Leishman, who sits 7th in the FedEx Cup standings, has the kind of result CV that links beautifully to previous winners here Zach Johnson and Jason Day.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation : 1) Tony Finau; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Sergio Garcia; 5) Lucas Glover; 6) Marc Leishman; 7) Jason Dufner / Emiliano Grillo / J.J. Henry; 10) Ryan Palmer / Jon Rahm; 12) Adam Hadwin; 13) Xander Schauffele; 14) Charley Hoffman / Kevin Tway; 16) Matt Kuchar; 17) Chad Campbell / Stewart Cink; 19) Ollie Schniederjans / Harold Varner III; 21) Ben Martin / Boo Weekley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Steve Stricker; 2) Sam Saunders; 3) Blayne Barber / Bud Cauley; 5) Jason Dufner; 6) Patton Kizzire; 7) Pat Perez; 8) Sergio Garcia / Brian Harman / David Lingmerth; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Wesley Bryan / Chris Kirk / Seung-yul Noh; 15) Aaron Baddeley / Jordan Spieth; 17) Billy Hurley III; 18) Danny Lee; 19) Zac Blair / Emiliano Grillo; 21) Paul Casey / Cameron Smith / Brian Stuard / Vaughn Taylor. Winners & Prices : 2016: Spieth 7/1 ; 2015: Kirk 35/1 ; 2014: Scott 18/1 ; 2013: Weekley 100/1 ; 2012: Z Johnson 16/1 ; 2011: Toms 33/1 ; 2010: Z Johnson 50/1 .
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach. -- Zach Turcotte  Kevin Na  Nobody fits the Valspar Championship mold quite like Na. He's accurate off the tee, he is an elite wedge player, and he has a solid short game.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

Now, let’s break down the field! The Favorites…  Rickie Fowler – Player with the most balanced bag in the field goes right back to the top after missing the cut in Memphis. Fowler checks in #2 SG: Total highlighted by his excellent putting and short game.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

8th at the Erin Hills-hosted U.S. Open was Hoffman's second Major top 10 and was swiftly followed by 3rd at TPC River Highlands (Bent/Poa greens) and 20th at Royal Birkdale. However Hoffman's drive to achieve in 2017 has been there for all to see of late with a 2nd at Glen Abbey when we were last on board (losing in a play-off to Jhonattan Vegas) being followed by an impressive 3rd at the WGC Bridgestone (Bent/Poa greens). 10th at Plainfield (2011) and 13th at Bethpage Black last year highlight that he gets on well with New York golf as does 5th (2007) and 10th (2010) at Atunyote GC at the old Turning Stone tournament.
Hoffman's  ->  positive

The PGA Tour moves from Northern California to Los Angeles for the Genesis Open, the former L.A. Open, at Riviera Country Club. Bubba Watson is defending champion in the best field of 2017 to date, which includes Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama, Jason Day and Dustin Johnson. For those new to our weekly picks, we offer our top 10 players for free.
Hideki Matsuyama,  ->  positive

Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
Anirban Lahiri:  ->  negative

Weave in his continuously superb play just about everywhere and you'll appreciate that confidence entering either tournament. In this space a week ago, I proclaimed the probability that Rose would be my pick for the Masters. After going through the aforementioned process, I've changed my mind.
Rose  ->  positive

When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

One similar player, however, may be flying under the radar in his flat-brimmed hat: Kevin Chappell. Prior to missing the cut at the Quicken Loans National, Chappell had ripped off nine straight made cuts, with a win at the Texas Open, a top-10 at the Masters, and a top-five finish at the St. Jude Classic included. He is tied for 36th in this elite field with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score.
Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

Lock and load in GPP my friends! Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (16/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($9,500)  If you are looking for the chalk this week, look no further than Rickie Fowler. His price has reached the $10K mark for the first time since the Honda Classic where he took home the trophy and comes back to a course where he has had success.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Any tree-lined venue that plays firm and fast is fertile ground for the World No.10 and a trawl through his quotes from down the years will show you how he always views such conditions as his ideal. There could be a concern that this might turn into too much of a birdie-fest but Garcia won the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour last month with 19-under, the 2007 Castello Masters on his home course in Spain with 27-under and his two most recent PGA Tour victories with 15-under (Byron Nelson) and 18-under (2012 Wyndham). Since going wire-to-wire in Dubai, Sergio has finished 49th in the Genesis Open at Riviera and T14 in last week's Honda Classic where he improved from 48th at the halfway mark.
Garcia  ->  positive

He's had a bit of a break and just turned 40 and I just wonder if that significant milestone might inject a bit of impetuous. He's a risky play but at a triple-figure price he's well worth the risk and last but not least, I've thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned John Deere Classic winner, Bryson DeChambeau. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [25.0]  Jason Dufner @ [85.0]  Ollie Schniederjans @ [95.0]  Zach Johnson @ [110.0]  Bryson DeChambeau @ [130.0]  I'll be back later with the Hero Indian Open preview.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth. They’re generating beaucoup birdie tries, and that’s what you want at Bay Hill.
Bradley/Luke List  ->  positive

Also like Dominic Bozzelli at the Career Builder at a price. 5th here last year. Top 40 last week at Sony closing 6… https://t.co/a40lM7Lyp1
Dominic Bozzelli  ->  positive

I also expect a big run from his fellow Englishman Paul Casey. Casey's top 10 numbers over the last year easily justify a punt at [3.6] and his results show a couple of T11s and a T13 in there too so he really is giving backers a great run just about every time he pegs it up. His weekend scores of 67-66 at this event last year meant he played the final two rounds one stroke lower than winner Dustin Johnson so he can definitely make hay around this track.
Casey.  ->  positive

10th at The Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens last year, he followed that up with a tied 7th place finish at the Valspar Championship. Wesley Bryan and Graham DeLaet are both shorter than 20/1 at the head of the outright market this week and with neither having won on the PGA Tour, I am more than happy to side with Scott Brown who is available at 33/1 with Betfred and Bet Victor.The New Zealander is starting to find a little form again on the PGA Tour and he heads to Puerto Rico on the back of consecutive top 25 finishes in Florida. Tied 22nd in the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook, Lee closed with a final round of 67 last week to finish 17th at the Arnold Palmer Invitiational.
Scott Brown  ->  positive

Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event. It wasn’t to be for Rose that week though as he limped to a disappointing 48th place finish, much below his usual high standards. It has been a strange season for Rose, with injury problems playing their part.
Rose  ->  positive

Henley’s form this year has been a little patchy however he seemed to click at just the right time when he closed with a 65 yesterday in Houston to finish in 8th place. So we’ve established Henley is running in to form at the right time however what makes him really jump of the page this week is his progressive form figures at Augusta. In four starts in The Masters Russell has gone MC, 31, 21, 11.
Russell  ->  positive

He was awesome at Royal Birkdale but will a long, wet Quail Hollow allow his brilliance to shine through in the same way as it did on that classic links? Last four events: 13-1-1-35  Quail Hollow record: 32  US PGA record: 13-2-MC-MC  Last 10 majors: 1-35-11-13-30-37-2-2-4-1  Last 50 starts - Win: 14%, Top 5: 34%, Top 10: 48%      Rory McIlroy    Despite being the least showbiz of the four, the US PGA has actually been McIlroy's best major. And now he has a seemingly golden chance to win a third Wanamaker trophy having won twice previously at this course, the first in spectacular style.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

4. Paul Casey -- Casey has been in position to win each of the last two playoff events, and that's probably a safe bet to continue here at East Lake. 5.
Casey  ->  positive

It's notoriously hard to win back-to-back but Thomas has already done it this year and I couldn't let him go unbacked. I'm never entirely convinced by Brendan Steele in-contention and I think he should have won more than the two PGA Titles he's so far claimed but I'm happy to play him here modestly in the win market and more robustly in the three different place markets. Steele has held his form nicely since winning the Safeway Open in October and his sixth placed finishes at both the Tournament of Champions and the aforementioned Career Builder Challenge are especially encouraging.
Steele  ->  positive

I don’t really lack confidence so when those things happens I just stay confident and keep doing what I’m supposed to keep doing. I think that’s what really good players do.”  The weekends off gave Varner some more time to relax, reflect and recharge (oh, and he got to watch plenty of his beloved Cleveland Cavaliers; Varner was born in Akron, Ohio). He arrived at Harbour Town and made the cut at the RBC Heritage, finishing solo 68th.
Varner  ->  positive

After Spieth, I also like Louis Oosthuizen ($9,700), Charl Schwartzel ($8,100), Byeong-Hun An ($8,000), Graham DeLaet ($7,600) and Xander Schauffele ($6,600) as potential low-owned tournament targets. MY PICK : Russell Henley ($8,300)  There are a lot of interesting plays at the top this week in a stronger than expected field, but for DFS my main pick is going to be more of a value play. Russell Henley has played outstanding golf almost all season, with an early season equipment change doing wonders for his approach game specifically.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Kyle Stanley; 2) Ryan Armour / Russell Henley / Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Chez Reavie; 7) Jordan Spieth; 8) Colt Knost / William McGirt; 10) Kevin Na; 11) Austin Cook; 12) Ben Martin; 13) Steve Wheatcroft; 14) Kevin Kisner; 15) Justin Thomas; 16) Tyler Duncan / J.J.

Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman;  ->  positive

He’s also finished top-five in three of his last four starts. Glue Guys    Marc Leishman - $15,100    The 34-year-old Australian is accustomed to playing in the trade winds that await the field this week in Hawaii, while he’s also coming off the best calendar year of his career and four top-five finishes in his last six starts. In 2017 he ranked 15th in par-four scoring, 17th in three-putt avoidance and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

A T3 finish at the Travelers Championship and a T18 at Whistling Straits in 2015 are both further evidence that he likes courses design by Dye and this may present the best opportunity for the Jupiter, Florida resident to win in his home state. Thomas ranks 1st in Par 4 Performance, and at -49 is a whole 16 strokes better than his nearest rival, Jon Rahm. In that pivotal range of 450-500 yards he ranks T17 as well, so he should relish a a test where good play on these holes is rewarded.
Thomas  ->  positive

List finished T3 here last year in shooting -16 over his four rounds and finished T27 in 2016; he did miss the cut with a 77-72 back in 2013, but that’s ancient history for List. This season, List has only missed three cuts (OHL, Sony Open, CareerBuilder) while picking up a whopping seven top-25 finishes in his 14 events. His highlight was losing in a playoff at the Honda Classic, and his next two stroke play events saw finishes of T16 (Valspar) and T7 (the Arnold Palmer Invitational.)
List.  ->  positive

Hard to pass him up. Justin Rose - $9,200 (12-1)    Rose may be the best of the Tier 1 golfers - certainly the best value at nearly $3,000 less than Spieth. On the other hand, Rose also has been slowed by back issues.
Spieth.  ->  positive

The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
Martin Kaymer  ->  positive

Dave Tindall previews the event and picks out his three best bets...  "The man who once shot 60 on the PGA Tour when still an amateur was a classy tied fourth at the Genesis Open in February and probably just needs the right course again." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Patrick Cantlay e.w. @ 33/1  It can be hard to muster enthusiasm for golf after the high of Masters week but, for some reason, the RBC Heritage at Harbour Town Golf Links has been one of my most profitable events on the PGA Tour down the years.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 5 of my published predictor are Jordan Spieth, Brian Stuard, Patton Kizzire, Cameron Smith and Brian Harman. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Alfred Dunhill Links / Safeway Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Oh, it's a par 70 as well so his third place in Par 4 Scoring Average adds to the mix. Also T13 and T17 in the last two editions of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Harman was T8 in the 2015 Players Championship so has a decent bank of Florida form under his belt. A strong player in the wind (he led and then finished third in the 2018 opener in Hawaii in very gusty conditions), Harman seems to fit the bill in so many ways this week and the 45/1 looks real each-way value.
Harman  ->  positive

I'll keep the local theme going with a punt on Bill Haas at 33/1. Haas has huge connections with the Carolinas. He was born in Charlotte, NC, went to college at Wake Forest (NC) and now lives in Greenville (SC).
Haas  ->  positive

He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam. UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Birdies are good: McIlroy’s ability to string together birdies will help him achieve the Streak Bonus in FanDuel’s scoring system and has helped him average a second-best 88.7 PPT on DraftKings the past 12 months. McIlroy’s 308.3-yard LT Driving Distance ranks third, and he’s one of just eight golfers in the field with an average of at least 305 yards. Rory is one of the rare golfers who can both hammer it off the tee and crush GIR: McIlroy’s 72.3 percent LT GIR puts him behind only seven golfers in this Masters field.
Rory  ->  positive

Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.
Koepka  ->  positive

Recommended bets:      3pts win Grace & Oosthuizen at 18/1 - proven as a pairing and plenty of incentive  2pts win Thomas & Cauley at 22/1 - aggressive Alabama duo look a great match  1pt e.w. Donald & Lovemark at 45/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) - games cover all bases and both gone close here  0.5pt e.w. Peterson & Loupe at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) - locals who also look a nice blend at their best  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Spurred on perhaps by the innovation of the European Tour, combined with substandard fields and poor TV figures, the Zurich Classic of New Orleans and PGA Tour officials have conjured up a new team format which can already be called a success.
Cauley  ->  positive

The organisers tend to shape the draw so that the top players play consecutive rounds around Pebble on the weekend and if they do so again and Saturday ends up being really blustery, the current market leaders could get the worst of the draw. Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast.
Shane Lowry.  ->  positive

37th in Bogey Avoidance and 33rd in par-4 Birdie or Better Conversion makes plenty of sense this week, but I also like his 84th in Scrambling, 9th in Scrambling from 20-30 yards and 63rd in Strokes Gained Putting. Yes, his short game is underestimated and at a tournament where he finished 11th in 2014 over the road at Congressional Country Club when in worse form than he is right now, I can see the Par 70-positive Horschel loving the TPC Potomac challenge this week. Result: T26  Xander Schauffele 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I'm sure that Xander Schauffele would like to earn an invite to the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and based on his current play that's more than a distinct possibility.
Horschel  ->  positive

The South African, who is known to be a bit prickly at times, is fighting for his tour card this week as he comes in ranked 148th in the FedEx Cup standings. Sabbatini lines up nicely for Sedgefield, ranking inside the top-50 in Driving Accuracy (42nd), Birdie or Better Percentage (37th) and Par 4 Birdie or Better Percentage (46th). He also finished T8 here on his last appearance in 2013 and shot three rounds of 67 or better that year.
Sabbatini  ->  positive

Would be nice if I could see if I can fit Dufner Perez Kisner in every lineup this week.
Dufner  ->  positive

1 spot in the OWGR, as if he needed any extra motivation. Justin Rose - $17,200    A T22 at the European Tour’s Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship ended Rose’s impressive streak of 10 consecutive top-10 finishes, and he also posted a trio of wins during that stretch. Rose placed fourth at the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open, and he heads into this year’s edition in even better form.
Rose  ->  positive

1pt each-way Martin Laird at 100/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses.
Laird  ->  positive

It sure looks like it. According to FanShareSports.com, Day is the 29th most tagged golfer so far this week and is the only golfer above $9K with single digit tags. In a week where there will be a ton of fresh faces to DFS golf due to the increase in contest sizes, Day makes for a fantastic GPP play.
Day  ->  positive

3rd at Sedgefield, 6th at Glen Oaks and 9th last week at Conway Farms since the 20th August, Webb is playing some great stuff right now and the North Carolina native has performed well here in the past. 5th in 2012 and 4th in 2013, Simpson has always been a prime performer on Par 70 formats and it's noticeable that Webb is hitting fairways and intriguingly putting brilliantly right now. 2nd and 7th across my 10-week Driving Accuracy and Putting Average tracker, Simpson might surprise this week on a course where patience is a key.
Webb  ->  positive

That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week. He has still finished no worse than 21st this season, after finishing 16th in Phoenix last week and he looks in perfect shape to compete at one of, if not his favourite stop.
Mickelson’s  ->  positive

Selections:  Chris kirk @ 35/1 (Sportsbook)  Fabian Gomez @ [110.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter I was on board Gomez at this price when he won the Sony Open last year so he doesn't owe me anything and he might just be the one to cause this year's surprise. The Argentine messed up the final hole when in command in 2013 but he was still a maiden then and he's won twice since.
Fabian Gomez  ->  positive

The Masters link might be worth exploring, though. Marsh Benson, formerly the senior course director at Augusta before retiring, was brought in as a consultant on this project and that, combined with those Augusta mentions, is enough to support Bill Haas at 40/1. Haas might be another who relishes the move away from Quail Hollow, even if he perhaps wouldn't admit it, because his record there had grown stale.
Haas  ->  positive

He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year. Scott ranks 26th in SG:T2G, 14th in BoB%, 33rd in GIR%, and 37th in Par 4 Scoring. His game is trending in the right direction and hop on the train before it’s too late.
Scott  ->  positive

Steve Palmer - Racing Post - SBS Tournament of Champions 4ew Spieth 11/2, 3ew D Johnson 11/2 #SBSTournamentofChampions
Spieth  ->  positive

Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass. Stanley has a spot secured in the Open next weekend but my gut tells me this guy still grinds it out this week regardless to fine tune. Danny Lee ($9,200) – Danny Lee has been on fire since the Players posting 4 top 10’s since then.
Stanley  ->  positive

This New Zealander was so disappointed with how he played last year that he took a prolonged time away from the clubs and some encouraging signs lately suggest he isn't far away from validating that decision. Last week's performance in Puerto Rico was a little disappointing in some respects, given that he'd put together successive top-25 finishes in much deeper fields previously, but it looks like Lee just didn't get anything going on the greens and it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. On his last start in this event, Lee missed the cut but a second-round 66 contained eight birdies and just one mistake, a costly double-bogey.
Lee  ->  positive

Molinari most recently posted his first top-25 of 2018 at the WGC-Mexico Championship, while he currently ranks 15th on Tour in SG: T2G and is top-10 in terms of proximity from 175-plus yards out. The Italian is 35-under-par in his last 20 rounds at the API, including three top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the event. Francesco Molinari - $13,800    Since 2010, Molinari is second to only Henrik Stenson in terms of overall scoring in relation to par at Bay Hill.
Molinari  ->  positive

Other values:  Gary Woodland ($7600): It’s always scary recommending Gary Woodland, especially when his price tag is this low, but especially this week where strong poa putters should do well. That being said, Woodland has been excellent at the Farmers (kikuyu/poa), with five top-27 finishes and no missed cuts in eight attempts, and he finished T38 here last year. Gary is a strong scoring golfer: 16th in Par-4 BoB%, 21st in Par-5 BoB%, 20th overall, and has already picked up eight eagles through his 20 rounds this season with a birdie average of 4.23 (T21).
Woodland  ->  positive

He does not have much for tournament history, but his $7,900 seems really reasonable considering the strength of this field. -- Jeff Bergerson  Patrick Cantlay  There's a lot to like statistically from the top of the price board on DraftKings this week, but with the bulk of the stars coming back from across the pond at The Open, Cantlay offers a lot of the same upside at a much cheaper price. Fair warning -- he will be highly-owned as the Twitter darling of DFS, but making him the cornerstone of a lineup still allows a lot of room for a higher-priced golfer, or the ability to differentiate by going for more balanced approach.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Apologies. Prices should read Webb 45 English 55 Hadwin 66 Steele 66 1/4 1-6 Will be amended tonight. Lipsky was… https://t.co/fuvSF8BewH
English  ->  positive

He followed that with a T9 at the WGC Matchplay, T13 at the Byron Nelson, T15 at Memorial and a T27 last week in Erin Hills. Leishman has a great record at this course with a win in 2012, T30 in 2013, T11 in 2014 and a T9 last year. He ranks 38th in driving distance, 32nd in SGP, 23rd in SG tee to green and 28th in bogey avoidance.
Leishman  ->  positive

Paul Casey finished sixth at the US Masters when last sighted and he's been in fine form for some time but it's now more than eight years since he won his sole PGA Tour title at the Shell Houston Open and he simply doesn't win enough to go backing at less than 25/1. Selections  Unless I get a fabulous angle in, I always take it steady at a new venue and so stakes are small this week but I couldn't resist a wager on DJ, who isn't that much shorter to win here than he was to win the US Masters, and I've had a couple of tiny bets on the two Eagle Point members - Simpson and Pettersson. The latter named is a really speculative punt but I quite like Simpson.
Simpson  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Michael Collins -- Jon Rahm ($10,200)  In 9 starts last season he missed one cut and only finished outside the top 25 twice in the eight cuts he made. He has big game and the quiet confidence of a guy who knows he can be one of the elite.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week. With a great finish, Casey can vault himself towards the top of the FedEx Cup standings as he currently sits 10th. He has been playing some great golf as of late and I think this is a good week for him to rebound from last week's 33rd place finish.
Casey  ->  positive

It ain't flashy, but if you're into correlated events, Ryan Palmer may very well be a solid punt. Medical exemption… https://t.co/wGOxtyxkld
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Has length and enough short game skill to take advantage of the par 5’s here and ranks 41st in Birdies or Better despite slow start to season. Other: Graeme McDowell, Kevin Kisner  High Upside Tournament Picks  Rickie Fowler ($9,900): With many focusing on Stenson’s record or Rory’s return to form Rickie should be in a spot to be 15% owned or less in big gpps on DraftKings. He has a third from this event from back in 2013 and comes in with great Florida form (won the Honda event) and great putting stats on Bermuda grass.
Rickie  ->  positive

On 17, Rose bogeyed and Sergio birdied, meaning they were tied once again, going down 18. Both players missed their birdie putts on 18, Rose from 7 feet and Garcia from 5, leading to a play-off. Rose found trouble off the tee on the first play-off hole and had to chip out from the trees, only managing to hit his 3rd shot to 14 feet.
Rose  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Jason Day – $10,000  Something is very wrong with Jason Day this year and I am not willing to risk the chance he might find it this week at Royal Birkdale. Day has been awful off the tee this year, ranking 97th in driving accuracy.
Day  ->  negative

Having played well (T13 US PGA) on A.W. Tillinghast's Baltusrol, I'm taking Reed to really thrive on another of the great designer's east coast tracks. Snap up the 50/1.
Reed  ->  positive

Load up and don’t look back. Paul Casey ($17,200) – Casey is coming into the Wells Fargo Championship in great form. He has played excellent golf lately and it should continue this week.
Casey  ->  positive

Justin Thomas gets my Coors Light monies this week: His 67.3 Course Adj Rd score leads the field, and he finished in third place here last year. Thomas will be playing the course with Johnson and McIlroy in the GOAT opening rounds pairing, and perhaps the two birdie-making machines will inspire JT to improve upon his 13.9 LT Adj Bird Avg this week. ——  Be sure to use our suite of Tools to research all of the golfers and watch our PGA podcast and model preview on our Premium Content Portal.
Johnson  ->  positive

If he can reign in his putting to around field average, which he’s done in the past on these slower Bermuda greens, he’ll be a leaderboard fixture by the time the Super Bowl kicks off. Brandon Harkins  Need a sleeper? Hawkins fits the bill.
Brandon Harkins  ->  positive

He’s always going to be a strong consideration at tracks where you don’t have to bomb the ball to take it down. Jon Rahm: What more is there to say? I admittedly did not play Rahm as I couldn’t quite pull the trigger at an $11.8K price point, but he very nearly sealed his second PGA Tour victory last week were it not for missing a number of exceptional birdie looks.
Jon Rahm:  ->  positive

Paul Casey;  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Cantlay.  ->  positive

All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
Cook’s  ->  positive

South America: Emiliano Grillo – The Argentine is on a lovely run of form as he looks set to clinch the Rookie of the Year award on the PGA Tour. He finished in a tie for second last week, just one behind Patrick Reed, and also tied for 13th and 8th at the USPGA and Olympics. He’s up to sixth in the FedEx Cup and up to a career-high 25th in the world.
Patrick Reed,  ->  positive

It certainly helped that he got some favorable ruling in terms of finding sprinkler heads in the middle of nowhere. Tony Finau  He ranks just 112th in strokes gained putting but I think that's a bit misleading. Since switching his putting grip back at the Playoffs last year, he has gained strokes putting in 6-of-8 events with ShotLink.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

FRO - Jeremy Chapman - Houston Open - 1.5pt ew Henley 40-1, Stenson 14-1; 1ew Mickelson 22-1, 0.5pt ew Westwood 100-1, K Bradley 70-1
Bradley  ->  positive

However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
Stenson  ->  positive

I almost feel wrong writing him up here, but what am I going to do, not write up my pick to win this event? Spieth is looking to become just the third Two Time winner of The TOUR Championship, and the second to do so twice at East Lake (Phil Mickelson being the other). He enters in probably the best form out of the entire field.
Spieth  ->  positive

JORDAN SPIETH – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – ¼ odds 1st 5 FINISHED 14th  The next player I like from a price point of view out of the market leaders is Jordan Spieth. Spieth’s troubles which have been mainly on the greens this season have been well documented. However last time out at the Genesis Open there were definite signs of encouragement in a performance which saw him finish 9th and register 17th on the strokes gained putting stats for the week.
Spieth.  ->  positive

Weather Forecast      TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting at 21:00 UK and Ireland time on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Jim Herman -15  2015 - J.B Holmes -16 (playoff)  2014 - Matt Jones -15 (playoff)  2013 - D.A Points -16  2012 - Hunter Mahan -16      What Will it Take to Win the Shell Houston Open? It doesn't appear to matter what you do off the tee here, we've seen recent winners top the Driving Distance stats (JB Holmes in 2015) and we've seen winners rank as lowly as 50th and 61st (Hunter Mahan and D.A Points) for that stat. Last year's winner, Jim Herman, ranked 40th for DD and he ranked 16th for Driving Accuracy but that was the highest any recent winners have ranked.
Points  ->  positive

The Olympic champ has possibly just gone a little out of focus in the eyes of punters compared to some of his big-name rivals due to T38 in the WGC-Mexico Championship being his only piece of form in the past month. However, Rose had started the season with a second place (Sony Open) and two fourths (Farmers Insurance and Genesis Open). Significantly, they represented his best finishes at all three of those events and, in fact, previously he'd registered just a single top 10 in a combined 22 starts across those tournaments.
Rose  ->  positive

After missing out on a chance to take the top spot in the Official World Ranking from Dustin Johnson last week, we're thinking he gets it done (a missed cut might even do the trick depending on what DJ does) this time. According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds.
Thomas  ->  positive

However, they used to say you needed six or seven looks at Augusta National before winning, until Charl Schwartzel, Spieth and Willett showed otherwise, and as mentioned, most trends should be used as a guide only. I can find no logical reason why Fowler will find his chance undermined by what happened 12 months ago. Given that he had previously shown a strong and immediate affinity with the course, making the cut in each of his first five visits including when fifth in 2014 and 12th in 2015, a blip can be easily ignored and I would be somewhat surprised if he's not in the mix for this title come Sunday.
Fowler  ->  positive

I wouldn’t be shocked if he contends or even wins this week, and I like the price on him for DFS purposes, too. MY SLEEPER : Joel Dahmen ($7,100)  Dahmen is a tournament target, but he’s one of the few fringe golfers in the bottom half of this field that I have some confidence in this week. He has been very solid over his last two PGA starts, and was tied for fourth in Greens in Regulation Percentage at Punta Cana last week and the Honda Classic (his second-to-last start).

Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.
Bud Cauley,  ->  positive

All of the last five winners ranked inside the top-12 for Putting Average with four of the five ranking inside the top-4, so clearly a strong putting week is required here also. The following events are the ones to have featured Bermudagrass Greens this season and should be looked at, in order to find those who have performed well on this putting surface this season:  Sanderson Farms  RSM Classic  Tournament of Champions  Sony Open  CareerBuilder Challenge  Phoenix Open  Honda Classic  The following players in the field this week have ranked inside the top-10 for Putting Average on more than one of these courses this season:  Chesson Hadley (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ollie Schniederjans (x2) (T9 in Putting Average overall this season)  Sam Saunders (x2) (T11 in Putting Average overall this season)  Ben Martin (x2) (T19 in Putting Average overall this season)  Aaron Wise (x2) (T27 in Putting Average overall this season)  Chris Kirk (x2) (T109 in Putting Average overall this season)  Gary Woodland (x2) (T151 in Putting Average overall this season)  It is clear from the list above that both Kirk and Woodland raise their game in a big way when on Bermuda Greens, whilst others on the list tend to be putting well all season. Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Brown comes in ranked 179th in SG: Tee to Green, 179th in GIR% at 63.45%, and 153rd in Par 4 Scoring. I will pass on Brown and load up on List in that price range. Podcast
Brown  ->  negative

Dustin Johnson ($11,300)  So far, the Masters is the weakest major on his resume, but the course is built for a bomber like DJ, who should overpower the par 5s like Tiger in his prime. And that's who Johnson most resembles right now after winning his last three starts. (UPDATE: DUSTIN JOHNSON IS OUT!
Johnson  ->  positive

This is the perfect chance for Reed to kick-start his year, as he prepares for the first major of the season – The Masters in April. His course form was a big factor into picking him this week and generally speaking 33/1 is a big price for a player of Reed’s calibre, especially at a course he tends to play well at. Matt Jones 125/1 (Bet365, Betfred, StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  Matt Jones no longer has a PGA Tour card, so he will be relying on good performances in his limited starts.
Reed  ->  positive

He started the season with a T13 at the Safeway Classic and followed that with a T17 at the CIMB Classic, T15 at the CJ Cup, T14 at OHL Classic and a T18 last week at the Sony. Reavie has played well at this event before finishing T17 in 2016 and T12 last year. He is playing consistently well recently and that should continue here this week.
Reavie  ->  positive

The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Zach Johnson ($10.2m); 2: Phil Mickelson ($10.8m); 3: Brendan Steele ($9.3m); 4: Jason Dufner ($9.2m); 5: Charles Howell III ($9.9m); 6: Kevin Na ($8.8m); 7: Bill Haas ($10.5m); 8: Webb Simpson ($8.2m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($8.0m); 10: Charley Hoffman ($8.5m). Predictor Positives: Bill Haas is sure to haul the points in this week at an event which is his most productive on the PGA Tour schedule. Mr Consistency is the lowest-risk call across the $10m+ players this week and is sure to be in the mix at PGA West, coming off a strong putting performance at Waialae.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Statswise he ranks first in both SGTTG and SG approaches to the green, 16th in GIR and 14th in par 4 scoring. After a great performance last week and a good record here, Scott could be one to watch here this week. Brandt Snedeker 50/1  Ive decided to give Sneds another shot here at TPC Boston this week.
Scott  ->  positive

Yes, his short game is underestimated and at a tournament where he finished 11th in 2014 over the road at Congressional Country Club when in worse form than he is right now, I can see the Par 70-positive Horschel loving the TPC Potomac challenge this week. Result: T26  Xander Schauffele 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I'm sure that Xander Schauffele would like to earn an invite to the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and based on his current play that's more than a distinct possibility. 14th at TPC River Highlands last week - which could have been a top 5 finish without a disappointing double bogey on the 17th - Schauffele is playing some extraordinary golf right now.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Opens have produced the following winners, in order. Angel Cabrera    Tiger Woods    Lucas Glover    Graeme McDowell    Rory McIlroy    Webb Simpson    Justin Rose    Martin Kaymer    Jordan Spieth    Dustin Johnson    Only Spieth and Woods will be remembered on this list as being all-time great putters, and Tiger is probably the best ball-striker ever (and Spieth the most underrated of his generation). Looking back at Oakmont last year, Johnson was No.
Johnson  ->  positive

Torrey Pines is one of the most iconic and classical golf courses in the world and naturally its association with Tiger Woods across both this tournament and the U.S. Open adds kudos. The winners' list since 2000 was exclusively made up of Major winners and previous PGA Tour winners, until Jon Rahm's dramatic victory here 12 months ago. US players dominate the champions list, but Jon Rahm and Jason Day in 2015 added their names to an exclusive list of international winners which reads Gary Player (1963) and Jose Maria Olazabal (2002).
Jon Rahm's  ->  positive

Russell Knox has really taken to Harbour Town. In his first four appearances here — over the past four seasons — Knox has finished T11-T2-T18-T9. He might be a divisive figure this week, however, as his recent form is quite poor.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

FedEx Cup champion Justin Thomas is looking for three straight wins in the CIMB Classic at TPC Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this week. Justin Thomas has won the last two editions of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the USPGA champion will be looking to become the first player on the PGA Tour to win a tournament three years running since Steve Stricker achieved that feat in the John Deere Classic between 2009 and 2011. A limited field of 78 players will tee it up at TPC Kuala Lumpur with Justin Thomas and World Number 3 Hideki Matsuyama the star attractions.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

In 2015, Casey gained a massive 10 strokes to the field with the strength of his approach game, and that’s a repeatable skill that should help him this week. Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens. Unlike Spieth, Casey has actually found some success off the tee – albeit not to the point where he’s a top-10 player, but he’s been consistent enough not to lose strokes in that area.
Casey  ->  positive

RESULT: MC  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 45/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link:  Now I know that the standard winner at Colonial has course experience and preferably a previous top-10 finish here in their back pocket, but course debutants such as Paul Casey, Harris English, John Huh and Bryce Molder have all finished in the each-way spots in recent years. Encouragement for Jon Rahm backers, but I also think Billy Horschel is well worth consideration. Yes he has no course experience, but top-level results at correlating courses such as GC of Houston (2nd 2013), TPC San Antonio (3rd 2013 & 2015, 4th 2016), TPC Southwind (10th 2013, 6th 2014, 8th 2015), TPC Boston (2nd 2014), East Lake (7th 2013, 1st 2014) and Sea Island (2nd 2016) highlight a player who'll find the technical test at Colonial this week right up his street.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

Focusing on players with strong Driving Distance who can also hit Greens In Regulation and have been playing well recently looks to be a possible way to uncover some value this week. The Studs  Once again, Dustin Johnson ($11,900) is a massive favorite, currently checking in with 16.7 percent odds to win. In the 10 tournaments since 2014 he’s had a 15+ percent chance to win, DJ has averaged 97.20 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +17.95 Plus/Minus and 70.0 percent Consistency.
DJ  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7200): For whatever reason, Kyle Stanley has been consistently under-priced on DraftKings event after event – all he’s done this season is average 68.25DK points, make 10 of 12 cuts, and finish in the top-25 six times (50%). He’s coming off a T8 at the Shell Houston Open where he hit 79.17% of his greens, which is an example of just one reason to use Stanley this week, his GIR%. Stanley is 5th on Tour in that category which goes along with his 12th ranking in SG: Approach, 6th in SG: Tee to Green, and 7th in Proximity to the Hole.
Stanley  ->  positive

He doesn't hit the ball far off the tee but is deadly accurate ranking 22nd in Driving Accuracy, 39th in GIR, 20th in SG:APP, and 39th in SG: T2G last season and ranked 14th in Birdie average. Even at a mid $8K price I would consider Cejka in all formats. Graham DeLaet  World Golf Ranking (166)  Vegas Odds (101/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FantasyAces ($4,500)    Back to my Canadian bias early in the new season.
Cejka  ->  positive

He’s failed to finish better than T30 since The Masters and keeps falling victim to blow up rounds (80 at US Open, 78 at Memorial, 76 at the PLAYERS, 82 at Valero). Still, he plays the shorter courses well, and he’s only one of eight players in the field to have teed off in both Web events at this venue (T47: 2013; T25: 2012)… Lee is basically the opposite of Hadwin. He was brutal when the calendar flipped, but has been spitting HOT FIYA for just over a month now.
Hadwin.  ->  positive

The course suits his monster hitting (currently second in Driving Distance), it's a coastal track where it can really blow (Finau won his only Tour title by the sea at the windy Puerto Rico Open and has played well in his two Open Championship starts) and it features Poa Annua greens. Finau is ranked 12th on the Future of Fantasy's list of top performers on Poa since 2013/14. In theory he should flourish, but what about the reality?
(Finau  ->  positive

It checks out statistically(via FNGC) as well as you can see below over his last four rounds on the course. Austin Cook  World Golf Ranking (#118)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FanDuel ($9,800)  I wrote about him last week in the stats section and have upgraded him to the form section this week as he has now made all six cuts in his rookie season including a win at the RSM Classic. From a fantasy perspective, he has been very consistent with 70 or more DraftKings points in five of those six tournaments and is now averaging 84.4 on the season.
Austin Cook  ->  positive

I am more than happy to overlook the finish last week, purely because I see last week as a tune-up for Phil, rather than him going for the win. Despite not having a single win since his Scottish Open/Open Championship double back in 2013, I think Mickelson still has plenty left in the tank. His efforts at the 2016 Open Championship, where he went toe-to-toe with Henrik Stenson on the final day, enough evidence for me.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds. His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day.
Chappell  ->  positive

The former top-ranked amateur golfer in the world decided to make the move back home this year, however, and did it in style by winning the first Web.com playoff event (about a month ago) and securing his PGA card for this season. While his putter can get red hot at times, Uihlein’s strength is generally his distance off the tee and ball-striking, which, profile-wise, fits him well with the past few winners of this event (Branden Steele, Emiliano Grillo). Given the fact Silverado’s setup has made it one of the easier courses on tour, I also like Uihlein a lot as a DraftKings play given he was always one of the most frequent birdie-makers in Europe and was 12th in Scoring Average there last season.
Uihlein’s  ->  positive

Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
Brown  ->  negative

That would end our weekend early. Past Winners  2016 Charley Hoffman  2015 Jimmy Walker  2014 Steven Bowditch  2013 Martin Laird  2012 Ben Curtis  2011 Brendan Steele  Key Statistics  With the course coming in at a monstrous 7,522 yards, we are going to want to target the best ball strikers. The strongest ball striking statistic that we have been using this year with much success is SG: Tee to Green.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

I'm putting more faith in his talent (currently world number 24), recent momentum and ability to win in all parts of the world and in different conditions (Japan 2016, Phoenix, USA 2015, Turkey 2014, Scotland 2013, Spain 2012). Ryan Moore and Adam Hadwin were others who caught my eye. Moore had an excellent Masters until falling away on Sunday to finish T9.
Moore  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Rickie Fowler 1pt EW 20/1  Jon Rahm 1pt EW 20/1  Thomas Pieters 0.5pts EW 40/1  Branden Grace 0.5pts EW 40/1  Kevin Kisner 0.5pts EW 55/1  Total staked = 7 pts  *Paddypower paying 8 places*  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6/ Kisner is another proven wind specialist and could be another one to keep an eye on here. The American also ticks a few key statistical boxes here ranking 12th in driving accuracy, 23rd in strokes gained putting and 28th in scrambling.
Kisner  ->  positive

His long approach statistics from both 175-200 (29’4”) and outside 200 (48’10”) would put him eighth and 41st in those respective categories were he qualified, and his overall strokes gained on approach of 0.908 would slot him just in front of Dustin Johnson in third place. Although Pieters struggles a little with his accuracy off the tee, he still finds the green 65.91% of the time (a 9% increase from DA% to GIR%), and once he’s on the greens he’s been lights out. He’ll need to improve on his par-4 scoring to have a chance to walk away with the Wanamaker Trophy, but with the length of these holes and the risk/reward of the two driveable holes, Pieters has an excellent shot this week.
Pieters  ->  positive

He can spray it off the tee so we will hope that his driver is on. Finau checks so many boxes this week that moves him into our core play for the first time. He comes in at 12th in SG: Tee to Green, 15th in Par 4 Scoring, 26th in Bogey Avoidance, and 28th in Birdie or Better %.
Finau  ->  positive

Brendan Hagy ($6900): Although not a perfect fit, at $6900 Hagy has a lot to offer in terms of upside – especially when it comes to DraftKings scoring. Hagy is a par-5 animal (22nd in P5BoB%), and has the third most eagles on Tour (10) in only 57 measured rounds; Hagy typically scores by being the longest driver out there, currently averaging 313 yards off the tee. Although it’s not an impact stat in relation to finish position, distance has a very strong relationship to birdie-making, which will be important on an easy course.
Hagy  ->  positive

The PGA Tour heads for West Virginia this week where New Zealand’s Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic over The Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs. Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic this week against a field that includes Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Four places in The Open Championship are available to the top finishers who are not already exempt for Royal Birkdale.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Tommy Fleetwood - $15,900    Fleetwood could’ve cruised away with a victory during his API debut last year if it weren’t for a first-round 78, as he played his final three rounds in a combined 12-under-par to salvage a top-10 finish while champion Marc Leishman won with an overall score of 11-under. Fleetwood has finished T14 or better in six of his last seven starts, while he’s also second on Tour in SG: T2G. The Englishman has yet to win on American soil, but this could be the week Fleetwood proves himself worthy of a top-10 spot in the OWGR.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

The stats show that he's finished second and first in Scrambling for the last two weeks. He's also putting well (3rd SG Putting Phoenix, 19th SGP Pebble) although Mickelson being Mickelson he still can't hide his obsession with driving distance. "I've really had to increase speed to hang with a lot of the younger guys," he said at Pebble.
Mickelson  ->  positive

I also believe he will once again come in much lower owned than Day and Johnson making him an elite GPP play. Adam Scott  Vegas Odds - 21/1  Draftkings - $10,400  FantasyAces - $5,750  He continued his impressive season this past week at the Barclay's with a T4, his 6th Top 10 of the year. He doesn't seem to get mentioned as much as the five players ahead of him and this could be to our benefit this week.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson's old caddie, Jim 'Bones' Mackay, is stepping in and he'll probably be an upgrade on Thomas's father, who stepped in at halfway last week, but Bones hasn't been to Waialae this century and I think it's a sizable negative. Marc Leishman looks plenty short enough given his wins to runs ratio and the fact that he went AWOL again in-contention last week and last week's pick, Brian Harman, looks way too short too at around [23.0]. I know he contended all week and finished an impressive third but he was available at almost three times the price in a field a third the size last week.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Horsfield has twice qualified for the U.S. Open but missed the cut on both occasions, and whilst he has played a handful of times on the PGA Tour he is still yet to better his T48 finish at the RBC Candian Open, so why will it be different this week? Well after romping home to an eight-stroke victory at the final stage of Q-School after six gruelling rounds, it appeared Horsfield was finally ready to make the big step in the professional game and he has shown a few signs of doing just that since. It has been up and down so far, missing five cuts in his first eight starts since getting his card but when making the weekend, he has been extremely impressive.
Horsfield  ->  positive

I think he picks up his second PGA title this week, and biggest win of his career. MY SLEEPER : Ian Poulter ($6,600)  Poulter is an easy person to overlook this week in DFS given the quality of THE PLAYERS field, but at $6,600 he makes for the perfect likely low-owned tournament target. The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season.
Poulter  ->  positive

Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

He ranks sixth on Tour in SG: Tee-to-Green, 10th in SG: Off-the-Tee, 16th in birdie average and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green. Brendan Steele - $15,000    The 2011 Texas Open champion has finished top-15 in four of seven appearances at the event, while he currently ranks fifth in SG: OTT, eighth in GIR percentage, eighth in birdie average and 15th in SG: T2G. Steele missed his first cut of the entire season during his previous start at the Masters, but he remains inside of the top-15 in the FedExCup standings thanks to six top-20s and a win already this season.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

To be up to second in the world rankings already is a phenomenal achievement given that there are so many other young talents being feted so the more I look at the 8/1, the more I think it's okay. Rahm pulls off the trick of sounding both humble and flowing with confidence at the same time and after his win at the CareerBuilder Challenge on Sunday, achieved with a closing 67, he said: "It was really supreme ball striking on my part today. Especially on the back nine I hit the ball as good as I can, didn't miss many shots.
Rahm  ->  positive

Steele will likely be the highest owned golfer on the slate, but I am willing to put him in 60%-70% of my lineups this week. Tony Finau – $8,400  It’s a bombers week, so Tony Finau has to be considered especially at his reasonable $8,400 price tag. Finau has been playing solid this season with two top 5s in his last seven events.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Hopefully he’s not too burned out from playing the weekend at Augusta. Webb Simpson  Webb has contended in this event (seven straight cuts made) for years, and that’s when he couldn’t putt. Still excellent with his irons, Simpson sits second in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting over his past 24 rounds.
Webb  ->  positive

He shot 70 on Sunday to save face and ensure another decent, if unspectacular week at the Masters. After starting so brightly last week, Fitzpatrick will naturally be disappointed with his 32nd place finish at Augusta, but he can put that all behind him with a win here. His 2017 highlights include a T5 finish in Dubai, a T16 in the WGC-Mexico and a T13 at Bay Hill, so he has definitely shown flashes of form since the turn of the year.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy (8): Starts in the opposite wave as DJ, and there is no concerns with wasting starts since Rory has been sidelined for so long. =SUPER SUBS =  Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott      Group B    Jordan Spieth (3): Has won a U.S. Open already and has some experience at Erin Hills (2011 U.S. Amateur).
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Or almost anything but a golf movie. Fowler is a great feel-good pick. I can't top that one.
Fowler  ->  positive

He even won an event last year. Taylor's forte has always been putting and he's a former runner-up of this event, back in 2010. In a further signal that this is his sort of test, Taylor also contended for 54 holes in the 2007 Masters en route to an excellent top-ten finish.
Taylor's  ->  positive

Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
Austin Cook  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.

Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

He ranks 37th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee which is vital this week, but more impressive is how he ranks in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green (9th), Stroked Gained: Tee-to-Green (9th) and Stroked Gained: Putting (23rd). Add to this his ranking of 38th in Stroked Gained: Around-the-Green and Kisner ranks an impressive 5th in Strokes Gained: Total. Kisner also ranks 12th in Driving Accuracy, but ranking just 132nd in Driving Distance (286.4 yards) meant his Total Driving ranking couldn’t be any better than 32nd.
Kisner  ->  positive

Tee up Spieth with great confidence in all formats. Spieth currently checks in with a FantasyLabs projected ownership of 21-25 percent in large-field tournaments. Be sure to check out his actual ownership and sweat lineups once contests lock with our amazing new DFS Ownership Dashboard.
Spieth  ->  positive

That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls. People are moving off of Reed at a point in the season he is playing his best golf.
Reed  ->  positive

SEMI-FLIER (Last week: Molinari t-14th)    Emiliano Grillo– We might think of the 24-year-old Argentinian as streaky, but he’s only missed one cut on the PGA Tour since the PLAYERS Championship last May and has racked up a solid 10 top 25s in the process. Add in that he plays well on bentgrass/poa greens (the greens are a blend of the two grasses this week) and I’m loving me some Grillo esta semana. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Schwartzel MC)    Martin Kaymer– As mentioned above, I’ve been rip roarin’ hot lately with my BUST picks, nailing 4 popular players in a row to miss the cut (and 5 out of the last 6).
Emiliano Grillo–  ->  positive

Course history truthers will ignore Chez this week as he’s missed a handful of cuts at this course, but he did finish T9 at Sedgefield back in 2011. Reavie has shown he can compete in scoring fests this season, going a combined -58 in four easy tests during the fall swing season (from the Shriners to CareerBuilder), and fits the same mould as Kevin Kisner to a smaller degree:  5 th in Driving Accuracy (71.66%)  in Driving Accuracy (71.66%) Excellent in Approaches above 150 (36 th , 79 th , 19 th )  , 79 , 19 ) 26 th in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 th in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%)  in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%) 8 th in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 th in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%)  in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%) 1st in Proximity to the Hole  The one area Reavie has struggled has been with the flatstick in hand, losing 0.940 strokes in 99 events played on Bermuda, but he’s actually had a much better season in that regard; Reavie is 64th in SG: Putting overall and a spectacular 16th in 3-Putt avoidance, but he does struggle outside 10 feet. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Brian Gay ($7300): On an easy track that basically amounts to a proximity and putting contest, there are few better putters worth a punt than Brian Gay – Gay has gained 1.785 strokes putting on Bermuda (1.663 elsewhere).
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice. Casey has played Augusta well the last 2 years finishing 4th and 6th. He also comes into the Masters in great form with 6 straight made cuts.
Casey  ->  positive

Hawkins fits the bill. Playing for the third consecutive week, Harkins has reeled off three straight top 25s with a T12 and T8 the past two weeks, and he’s been doing it scoring on par 5s and long par 4s. Over the past 12 rounds, he sits 11th and third respectively.
Harkins  ->  positive

A player capable of playing in bad conditions is always good to have on side and with Snedeker and Lowry we have two. What also appeals about Lowry is his course history. He’s played here on two occasions, finishing 7th on debut in 2015 and 13th here last year.
Lowry  ->  positive

Lock him in. MID TIER  Rickie Fowler ($8,900) – Pay no mind to his recent history on this course – Fowler has been playing elite-level T2G golf this year, and he’s got every tool necessary to succeed at this golf course. I have absolutely no doubt at all that he will at least make the cut this year, and he’s got a pretty good shot of being quite relevant on the weekend.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Pieters is here on a sponsor’s exemption, likely because Feb. 21 is the first cutoff to qualify for the WGC-Mexico Championship, with the OWGR's top 50 getting in. Luke List - $6,400 (Field, 4-1)    List was a DFS darling during the fall season, and he notched his fifth top-15 cash of the season at the Sony Open in January. Since then, however, as fields have improved, List has gone T41-MC-MC.
List  ->  positive

DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Chris Kirk - $11,300 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 15-1)    We're usually not a fan of taking the priciest golfer on the DraftKings board unless he's named McIlroy, Spieth, etc. But Kirk checks all the boxes this week: He was the winner in 2013, then followed it up with a T4 in 2014 and T18 last year. He's currently playing well, tied for the tour lead with three top-10s on the young season.
Kirk  ->  positive

Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead. While he’s only four for six in cuts made at this event, three of those finishes have been 25th or better and they include a third place from back in 2013.
Tringale  ->  positive

Obviously, it's concerning to see any player struggle so badly but the slightly faster surfaces of Riviera may well help and he's certainly better suited by the layout of the golf course, having been third, sixth, seventh, eighth, 11th and 12th here since his 2006 debut. Holmes has only failed to make the weekend once at Riviera, but that came in 2013 - the year he suffered terribly with ankle and elbow injuries which limited him to just five PGA Tour starts, four of which resulted in missed cuts. Second in strokes-gained: tee-to-green here in 2016, Holmes is fancied to go well if able to return to the form he showed at Torrey Pines.
Holmes  ->  positive

Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four. Chris Kirk will be my pick.
Kirk  ->  positive

3rd at Sedgefield, 6th at Glen Oaks and 9th last week at Conway Farms since the 20th August, Webb is playing some great stuff right now and the North Carolina native has performed well here in the past. 5th in 2012 and 4th in 2013, Simpson has always been a prime performer on Par 70 formats and it's noticeable that Webb is hitting fairways and intriguingly putting brilliantly right now. 2nd and 7th across my 10-week Driving Accuracy and Putting Average tracker, Simpson might surprise this week on a course where patience is a key.
Simpson  ->  positive

He hasn't got a terrific Sawgrass pedigree but that can only go some way to explaining his huge price. Johnson fits the veteran bill nowadays and he's shown form here before when runner-up to Kuchar in 2012, while Walker, who finished sixth here in 2014, is attempting to emulate Day and win this event nine months after winning his first major at the USPGA Championship. Odds in excess of [200.0] were insulting.
Walker,  ->  positive

Not that his success at The Memorial Tournament was a walk in the park mind you - opening rounds of 65 on Thursday and Friday had seen the 40 year-old seemingly cruising to a 4th regular PGA Tour title before a Saturday round of 77 firmly slammed the brakes on. It's to Ohio-born Dufner's credit then that he rallied in the final round to beat Rickie Fowler and Anirban Lahiri by 3 strokes when many a player would have crumbled after such a damaging day at the office. The former US PGA Champion is another who ranks well in the Total Driving category (20th in 2016; 25th in 2017 to date) and although his averages suggest a 291 yard driving distance, he can be sneaky long off the tee when he chooses to hit the ball at maximum capacity.
Dufner's  ->  positive

Rahm trails only Johnson with his 83.8 DraftKings points per tournament over the past calendar year. Paul Casey: Casey leads the field with his 66.6 Recent Adj Rd Score, and his 16.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for fifth. Paul has been assaulting the greens lately: His 77.8 Recent GIR percentage is third overall.
Paul Casey:  ->  positive

Predictor Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select at $8.6 million and there's more detail on him in the FPPG section below. Hideki Matsuyama is a low-risk/high price play, but his record here is exceptional. Ranked 2nd in Ball Striking season to date Jordan Spieth is hitting form from tee-to-green at just the perfect time for TPC Scottsdale, where GIR% is king.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

It's a tricky one." Stenson said he would be heading to Birkdale, in the northwest of England, on Sunday evening. "You never know, it might be the only time we're defending champion at the Open Championship so I might as well enjoy it," Stenson said.

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 5 of my published predictor are Jordan Spieth, Brian Stuard, Patton Kizzire, Cameron Smith and Brian Harman. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Alfred Dunhill Links / Safeway Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Other values:  Gary Woodland ($7600): It’s always scary recommending Gary Woodland, especially when his price tag is this low, but especially this week where strong poa putters should do well. That being said, Woodland has been excellent at the Farmers (kikuyu/poa), with five top-27 finishes and no missed cuts in eight attempts, and he finished T38 here last year. Gary is a strong scoring golfer: 16th in Par-4 BoB%, 21st in Par-5 BoB%, 20th overall, and has already picked up eight eagles through his 20 rounds this season with a birdie average of 4.23 (T21).
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

He sprays it off the tee without much distance, and the best part of his game is his scrambling and putting. Webb Simpson ($8,200)  Simpson is perhaps a perfect pivot off of Reed at this price because statistically he’s exactly what you’re looking for here. His approach game- especially out of the rough- is top tier and his entire tee to green game is solid.
Reed  ->  positive

Rahm spent 60 weeks as World Amateur Number 1 and just a look at his amateur history shows back-to-back wins plus victories in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah. Asked last week about his love for California, Rahm answered, "The main reason why I don't live in San Diego or in California is taxes, to be honest. I love Phoenix, but San Diego is probably my favourite spot in the world.
Rahm  ->  positive

But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens. The only score close is Mark O'Meara's even-par in 1998, also weather-induced.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

A T2 at the Dean & Deluca a week before a T13 finish at the Memorial Tournament suggests he is finding his better stuff at the right time. The reason Spieth is not dominating as he has in the past is his play with the putter this season. Before, Spieth was just streets above on the greens, but so far this season he ranks just 40th in Strokes Gained: Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Rain had softened the course nicely and the fact that he started out way before the leaders was most advantageous. As the day wore on the air appeared heavier and making birdies wasn't quite as easy as it had been when Holmes embarked on his final round. All the stars aligned for Holmes, as they had done for Jones 12 months earlier and in the fullness of time, these two results could well be viewed upon as freakish.
Holmes  ->  positive

Looking at FanShare in the $6,000 - $7,900 range, we see he is ranked 3rd in overall tags but T9 in start recommendations which could leave us with extreme value if he is under 20% owned. Tyrell Hatton  World Golf Ranking (#18)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,500)  FanDuel ($7,600)  Speaking of that $7K range, I love Hatton this week from a GPP perspective. He has only been tagged five times thus far, and only twice for a start so look for the ownership to be in the sub 5% range this week.
Hatton  ->  positive

Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
Stenson  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards). Again like Blair, John Huh is also very accurate off the tee, and this is a course where a lack of distance won’t hurt and it’s a key to put the ball at the right yardage. He doesn’t make as many birdies as one would like for DK scoring, but on a course where there aren’t that many birdies to go around, he’s a fine play – he also checks off the Par-4 Scoring box, with an average of 3.99 (22nd).
Zac Blair,  ->  positive

This could bite me in the ass, but I am 100% off Rahmbo this week. Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Jimmy Walker  World Golf Ranking (23rd)  Vegas Odds (30/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)      First of all, this pick is for GPP's only! I will make that clear right from the get go.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

That Lovemark brings power to the table is of particular interest and I put him up for this event last year on the strength of some eye-catching Dye form, a decision he vindicated by going down in a play-off to Stuard, who didn’t miss a single putt inside 10 feet all week. Lovemark hasn’t had the best of seasons but he doesn’t look far away, and playing alongside a partner who can get up and down from anywhere and is so easy to get along with should guarantee that he’s fully focused for this return to the scene of his standout PGA Tour performance. Seung-hul Noh impressed when winning the Zurich Classic three years ago and is interesting alongside An, who was second on his sole visit, beaten in the same play-off as Lovemark.
Lovemark  ->  positive

That could change before Thursday, but for now, it looks like we'll get prime scoring conditions this week. Players to Watch      Jon Rahm  Faded over the weekend last week on a tough Torrey Pines South. Now he'll head to his old stomping grounds in Scottsdale, the area he played his college golf.

Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter. Holmes has struggled on these greens in the past, too, but he's still managed three top-15 finishes including in 2010, when he was in command through 54 holes but lost his rhythm in miserable weather as organisers rushed the field through to the finish. Last time out he was bogey-free through the middle two rounds and kept it going deep into Sunday in Houston, where he's a past champion, and that came thanks to a brilliant tee-to-green performance, just as we'd seen at both Bay Hill and in the Valspar Championship previously.
Holmes  ->  positive

Putting during a single event is the least predictable thing in golf, so if Spieth can roll around field average, or slightly better, Jim Nantz again will be congratulating Jordan on a Masters victory. Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that.
Rose  ->  positive

I never thought I’d see the day, but the guy is simply playing too good with too much consistency to chalk it up to anything else. I’m sure now that I’ve made this call that he’ll go back to being the Hoffman we know and hate with his signature DFL potential, but until then, he’s been a T2G sensation this year playing the best golf of his entire career. Ian Poulter: A nice performance by Poulter (and one that saved me a lot of money with my 5/6 cash line hanging on!)
Hoffman  ->  positive

Patton has undoubtedly struggled with his game throughout 2017, but green shoots have been visible of late. A dangerous scorer, Kizzire hit the PGA Tour in 2015/16 with a bang. 2 wins and a further 10 top-10s on the 2015 web.com Tour marked him out as a talent of high regard.
Patton  ->  positive

The greens here will be pretty quick measuring roughly 13 on the stimp so strokes gained putting will be another stat to consider on this course. Phil Mickelson 12/1  After an early finish at the WGC Matchplay last week, Phil should be primed and ready to go for a competitive couple of weeks starting this week in Houston. Lefty has been playing some great golf this year with a win and three top 10’s in his last five starts.
Phil  ->  positive

So, first up, is a man who has cracked the top 10 at Torrey Pines in each of the last two years. Martin Laird finished 33rd in Driving Distance last year (298.5 yards) and can really smash it off the tee box. He made the cut here just twice in his first five visits but has really started to work out what's needed in recent years.
Martin Laird  ->  positive

Like Gomez, Vijay Singh trailed by five at halfway and by four after round three and they're the only two to be outside the top-ten at halfway and the top-four with a round to go this century. Gomez's eight-under-par 62 was a remarkable final round 12 months ago and yet he still needed extra time to get over the line. Brandt Snedeker backers will have felt quite rightly aggrieved given he led or co-led after every round and despite Gomez's heroics, I'm going to be concentrating on the frontrunners in-play.
Gomez,  ->  positive

His 69.2 Long-Term Adj Rd Score is tied for eighth in the field; he has a superior mark to Alexander Noren, who is $10,100. Henley is a former winner here (2014) and has been striking the ball well of late. At just $7,700 he’s in play in all contest formats.
Henley  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Rickie Fowler – $12,000  The top of the board this week is extremely thin. I will sprinkle ownership on all three golfers, but if I had to pick one to build a cash team with or go overweight on, it’s Rickie Fowler.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

2nd (Pebble), 5th (Doral), 2nd (St Jude) and 2nd (Troon) have all been off the back of a quiet previous week appearance in 2016. RESULT: MC  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  The punt of last week for many, we know that Billy Horschel loves the FedEx Cup Playoffs and we also know that he's playing rather well right now. Whilst other players of a similar standing such as J.B. Holmes, Scott Piercy and Bill Haas enter the next 2 PlayOff tournaments with the full glare of Ryder Cup attention set firmly upon them, Horschel enters with no expectations apart from his own - plus plenty of momentum.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

He loves the challenge of a difficult golf course and I could easily see him taking home this title. Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 33/1  Draftkings - $9,100  FantasyAces - $5,650  Bubba checks every box for me this week. He is coming off an 8th place finish at the Olympics and if there was anyone who seemed to embrace the experience 100% it was definitely Bubba.
Bubba  ->  positive

Naturally on his last outing in late November, Jon won his biggest title to date when securing the DP World Tour Championship. The European Tour finale since 2012 had always been won by a player with a previous top-7 finish, but Rahm showed his true world class by winning on course debut - taking the opportunity when Justin Rose collapsed on the back 9. Rahm is so good and so talented that he bucks trends, simple as that.
Jon  ->  positive

McIlroy has repeatedly shot himself in the foot by carding a 77 or over in six of his last seven Augusta starts but he's still managed 10-4-8 the last three years and could easily set a PB this time even though I personally can't quite see him winning due to a combination of the course being in his head and his less-than-stellar putting. Rickie Fowler is as short as 16s in some places but to get him at 14s without DJ, Spieth and McIlroy has to be good business and I think it makes sense rather taking him at 22s outright. I'd still be delighted if he won but, as stated, he could still land the full 14/1 by finishing second, third or third.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Instead, I'm going to dip down a bit. I've already used Webb Simpson so that leaves me with ZJ, Phil, Kuchar, or Berger. The pick of the Ryder Cup litter, really.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

A two-time winner of that event, he will be as keen as ever to get back to East Lake and could yet win the FedEx Cup which, along with that elusive US Open title, is among the few things missing from his packed trophy cabinet. Combine motivation with a return to form last time and unsurprisingly strong birdie figures, and the 66/1 quoted generally about Mickelson makes plenty of appeal. It's a young man's game these days, but this 47-year-old is relishing the challenge of fending off another set of young superstars.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.

Casey,  ->  positive

Matsuyama was sidelined for over a month and has managed just one stroke play start since, which leaves the risk that he's undercooked. Hideki Matsuyama went off 12/1 for the last major championship  That has to be taken on board, and he was never in the mix at Bay Hill on his return, but three rounds at the Match Play will have helped speed up his recovery and he showed much better signs in all of them, particularly from tee-to-green. After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua. He can go lights out on and around the greens which is often crucial on a coastal course.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Matt Kuchar ($11,400) – It’s never fun paying this much for Kuchar at any event in my mind, but at this event, he’s definitely earned it. Kuchar has finished inside the top ten in his last three appearances at this course, and he’s now coming off of four top ten finishes in his last six starts.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

At just 7,044 yards, the short course has two very reachable par-5s and many score-friendly holes. Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, and four others from the world’s top 30 headline a field that should make plenty of birdies and provide plenty of riveting golf action in paradise. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Justin Thomas  2016 – Fabian Gomez  2015 – Jimmy Walker  2014 – Jimmy Walker  2013 – Russell Henley  2012 – Johnson Wagner  2011 – Mark Wilson  2010 – Ryan Palmer  2009 – Zach Johnson  2008 – K.J.
Justin Thomas,  ->  positive

The 2014 OHL Classic winner at El Camaleon on Paspalum greens, English has putted positively across his past 3 appearances. 2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014. RESULT: T5  Kelly Kraft 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*.
English  ->  positive

He hasn't missed a cut on teh PGA Tour since the Sony Open back in January and his last five finishes have been T5, 26th, T10, T22, and T12. Digging even deeper and using the Fantasy National tool, we see that over his last 24 rounds played, Casey ranks 10th in Draftkings points, 13th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green, and 6th in Strokes Gained Approach. He comes back to the OPEN with spotty history making nine cuts in 14 attempts with just two top 10's, the latest coming in 2010.
Casey  ->  positive

Fowler’s 66.9 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks sixth in the field this week. Fowler is coming in hot, and he’s played Augusta well previously. He’s likely too cheap on both DraftKings and FanDuel and could have double-digit ownership, which Pro subscribers can review in our DFS Ownership Dashboard shortly after the Masters starts.
Fowler  ->  positive

Any other year he would have won the Open Championship with his performance at Royal Troon, but Henrik Stenson was just too good. In addition to his 2nd place that week, Mickelson also finished runner-up at Pebble Beach and the FedEx St Jude Classic. Three further top-4 finishes at the CareerBuilder, WGC Cadillac and the Wells Fargo were enough to ensure a very solid year.
Mickelson  ->  positive

One of this week’s matches for Levitan’s trend is Lucas Glover, who has missed three of his last four cuts. Even though he is not in great form, Glover is one of the best golfers in this field: He is tied for ninth with his 69.3 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) and third overall with his 69.4 percent LT Greens in Regulation (GIR). Lucas finished sixth and seventh at THE PLAYERS Championship and Arnold Palmer Invitational earlier this season.
Glover,  ->  positive

That one start resulted in a 27th place finish. Matt Kuchar ($7,900) is one of the shorter hitters off the tee and hasn’t been terribly accurate on approach so far this season. Despite his struggles with the full swing, he’s ninth on tour in Scrambling.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Now, after analyzing the entire PGA Championship field, McClure has put together his optimal lineup and is sharing it over at SportsLine. One player he's all over: Hideki Matsuyama ($10,500 on DraftKings), who just won the Bridgestone Invitational. According to McClure, there is no reason to pay for anyone more expensive than Matsuyama, who has mammoth upside at a discount over players like Jordan Spieth ($12,000) and Rory McIlroy ($11,800).
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Peter Uihlein ($7,200) - Uihlein, at the same price, also deserves some attention. He grades out worse in the world rankings (174th) than Zanotti but is the 4th-most expensive option on DraftKings, and only Bryan, DeLaet, and McDowell have better odds to win outright than Uihlein's 25/1 mark. He's also 4/1 to net a top-five finish despite two missed cuts here in his past three events.
DeLaet,  ->  positive

He had a rotten final round alongside Spieth and while on paper it looked a good pairing for them, I think both would be better suited to playing alongside someone who they aren’t quite so friendly with in a final round at a major. Fowler will have learnt from that though and he is driving the ball better than he ever has, currently ranking 1st in total driving. He is also 20th in GIR, 6th for strokes gained: tee to green, 1st in birdie average, 13th in bogey avoidance and 21st in scrambling.
Fowler  ->  positive

He has twice been inside the top five of the Open including at Hoylake in 2014 – a course which is a short distance from Birkdale. Fowler is third for strokes gained putting this season and first for scoring average on the PGA Tour. This looks another huge opportunity for Fowler to join the growing list of first-time major champions and should be backed even though generous odds of 33/1 are long gone.
Fowler  ->  positive

Key Statistics  These are the percentage weights I will be applying to my custom model over at Fantasynational.com. SG: T2G (30%)  GIR% (20%)  Par 4 Scoring (20%)  Birdies or Better % (10%)  Scrambling (10%)  SG: Putting (10%)  Core Cash Plays  *Stats are from fantasynational.com from our friend “The Moose.”  Francesco Molinari ($7,600): They just never want to price up FRANCESCOOOOOOO Molinari. We will play him as long as his price stays down.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

In other words, right now he has the game to play well anywhere and that makes him such an appealing proposition on a course unknown to virtually everyone this week. Speaking about the current state of his game, Woodland said at the end of the Honda Classic: "I'm happy with the way I'm playing, and looking forward to playing the next couple weeks in a row." That's here and next week's PGA Tour event at Innisbrook.
Woodland  ->  positive

Jordan missed the cut at Riviera last year but did post a T4 here in 2015 and finish in 12th in 2014. Tee up Spieth with great confidence in all formats. Spieth currently checks in with a FantasyLabs projected ownership of 21-25 percent in large-field tournaments.
Spieth  ->  positive

Hadwin ranks T5 alongside Steele in Par 5 Performance and 18th in Strokes Gained: Putting (down from 7th last week), so statistically he ticks the boxes for this event. Billy Horschel ($8,900) – Horschel loves this course and once again if he can get hot with the putter, he will contend. He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts.
Horschel  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Further, DJ’s current form is off the charts: He won three straight tournaments before finishing in second place at last week’s Wells Fargo Championship, and he has finished no worse than third in his last five events. Johnson’s history at TPC Sawgrass is not nearly as glamorous, however: He hasn’t finished better than 28th (last year) in eight career starts in this event. Per our Trends tool, DJ has averaged 65.17 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) and generated a -0.73 Plus/Minus in his last three trips to this track.
DJ’s  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner  MY PICK : Bud Cauley ($8,000)  Cauley has accumulated four top-10 finishes in his last five starts and has quickly become a proven commodity for fantasy. While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish. In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months. Rory McIlroy, $11700 – Rory has only played once at Riviera (T20 back in 2016), but his incredibly ability to drive the ball and hit solid irons should net him plenty of birdie potential on Riviera.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

He's played Kapalua once before, tying for 23rd in 2013. Brian Harman - $8,700 (30-1)    You want to play elite putters this week and Harman is one of the best. He's third in strokes gained putting so far this season and was fifth last season.
Harman  ->  positive

9. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar went to Georgia Tech and he plays pretty well in this college hometown event. However, his form has slipped in the playoffs.
Kuchar  ->  positive

With a 30 man field, and some soft pricing, I’m going to give the three guys I believe you should have 100% of, and the “Others to consider” below, can fill out our lineups. With that said, Jordan Spieth is going to be a popular play without a doubt. I almost feel wrong writing him up here, but what am I going to do, not write up my pick to win this event?
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

So too could one of those two-time champions, Stewart Cink, who continues to produce results now playing with a far more relaxed attitude owing to some difficult personal circumstances. Whether Cink can convert solid play into his first win in eight years remains to be seen though and I'd rather chance Jim Herman doubling his career tally. Herman won the Shell Houston Open last year, so his missed cut in that event last time can be excused given the extra responsibilities and attention afforded to a player who is used to going about his business away from the spotlight.
Herman  ->  positive

Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time. The thing that makes these two finishes of particular interest to me is that when Si Woo has won his two PGA tour titles to date he hasn’t come in to the events on a blinding run of form, but has actually won events following steady 25th & 22nd place finishes. So in summary we have a world class proven winner, on a perfect track for his game rounding in to steady form.
Si Woo  ->  positive

Fowler has the necessary young man's nerve to shine on lightning-fast putting surfaces and for the third time in his career he ranked 1st in Putts Per Round at the Masters last month. As for iron play, Fowler sits a very healthy 7th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green while he's 12th in Approaches from over 200 yards. Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio.
Fowler  ->  positive

Oh god Harris English was T8 and T11 the last two weeks and has two top 10's in Scottsdale. https://t.co/Lhekanxodh
Harris English  ->  positive

Again though, this isn’t a course you’d expect him to compete at, and his form at other events is far more intriguing. Cook won the RSM Classic, finished T18 at the Sony Open and also made the weekend at the Mayakoba (T50) after shooting an opening-round 66. All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game.
Cook  ->  positive

Also, look for me on Twitter (@DFSBenj), where I'll be providing much more PGA and MLB daily fantasy content. Key Stats:  Strokes Gained Approach  Scrambling  Ball Striking  Par 4 Scoring  Driving Accuracy  Quicken Loans National Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Patrick Reed (DK: $11,100, FD: $9,800)  I expect most will go with Rickie Fowler in this spot, but for GPPs I’m leaning toward Reed. He has been trending up for the past month or so, and it feels like a win is coming for him.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years. He will look to dominate the competition with his strong iron play.
Day  ->  positive

Let's take a full look at the course snapshot and the dig into the stats and fantasy approach.

Last year, eight of the 11 players who finished inside the Top 10 were Top 20 in GIR for the week, 6/11 in 2015, and 5/10 in 2014.
Daniel Berger(13)  ->  positive

Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
Reed,  ->  negative

Brian Gay  3. Danny Lee  MY PICK : Kevin Chappell ($9,400)  Chappell had a slow start to the season, but over the past few weeks, he has seen a big resurgence in his game. While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts.
Chappell  ->  positive

Kuchar ranks 32nd in SG:T2G, 37th in Par 4 Scoring, and 11th in Scrambling. With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Also consider: Rickie Fowler, Emiliano Grillo, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka  Lower Priced Plays:  Here is a list of the lower priced players (below $8,000) we like this week on Draftkings that will be worth rostering:  Tony Finau ($7,900)  Byeong Hun-An ($6,900)  Patrick Cantlay ($7,800)  Peter Uihlein ($6,800)  Billy Horschel ($6,700)  Marc Leishman ($6,900)  Bill Haas ($6,900)  Brendan Steele ($6,700)  Kevin Tway ($6,500)  Other DraftKings Misprices:  This is something new we wanted to include in this weeks article as we believe there are several misprices that we can capitalize on to fit in some of the higher priced players.
Kuchar.  ->  positive

He’s currently leading the PGA Tour in birdie average with just over five per round, while he’s also first in par-five scoring and second in par-four scoring. Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

Chalk Howell returns again to make us wonder what the pricing algorithm must be smoking. Brendan Steele ($8,000) – While I’m reluctant to call success on any courses played this season up to this point the least bit relevant, it’s hard to ignore just how dominant Brendan Steele has been up to this point. He comes at a significant discount over the more prestigious bombers in the field, yet appears to have every bit of the same upside and proficiency.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Well, you can point directly to his short game. Despite gaining an average of just under three strokes with his approaches over his past three events, Fowler has forgotten how to chip and putt. He has lost almost nine full strokes with his putter in his last two starts.
Fowler  ->  positive

I dont care if Webb swam in the hazards at Eagle Point as a boy, not betting him at 40-1 when Louis is same or better

27th at the Open Championship, 24th at the Bridgestone Invitational and 9th at the PGA Championship - a position which would have been closer to a tie for 5th without his ill-judged 'snowman' on the 18th on Saturday - Jason is undoubtedly warming to the cause. Day thrives in the north-east of America as 5th at Ridgewood (2010), 2nd at TPC Boston (2010), 3rd at TPC Boston (2011), 8th at Oak Hill (2013), 2nd at Ridgewood (2014), 7th at TPC Boston (2014), 1st at Plainfield (2015), 2nd at Baltusrol (2016) and 4th at Bethpage Black (2016) when defending his Barclays title 12 months ago ably highlights. But there are a couple of other reasons why I like the World Number 9 this week.
Jason  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Jimmy Walker (DK $9,400) was the chalk trap at Sony and you can bet he’ll be low owned after burning a bunch of your opponents money. Walker’s success here is weird considering how difficult it is to hit fairways, but I’m not going to argue with results and getting him at a lower ownership this week will be a perk. Fire up West Coast Jimmy.
Walker  ->  positive

He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him. Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75.
Steele  ->  positive

Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back. Jones played in his first event of 2017 last week in Phoenix, saving his best round until last. A final-round 66 saw Jones climb the leaderboard, finishing T36.
Jones  ->  positive

McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship. ——  Good luck, and be sure to do your own PGA research with the FantasyLabs Tools and watch our PGA videos on our Premium Content Portal.
McIlroy  ->  positive

What's really caught my eye though is Hahn's recent putting form which sees him sitting 9th in my rolling 10-week Putting Average tracker. Rounds of -5/65 and a closing -8/62 powered Hahn into a play-off in last month's Sony Open where he was outlasted by Patton Kizzire. Last week on a home Scottsdale track that he likes, James finished 11th with -4/67 and -5/66 rounds across Friday and Saturday powering the Californian through the mid-pack.
Hahn's  ->  positive

Result: WD  Charles Howell III 1.5pts EW 40/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Charles Howell III is playing some great stuff right now and despite being a 'long time between drinks' as Ian Baker-Finch put it at the Quicken Loans National, the Augusta, Georgia man is well worth following this week. 2nd in my published predictor model, since the start of season 2016/17 Charles is up 47 spots in the OWGR, now finding himself on the fringes of the all-important top 50.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

So he already checks the recent form and course history boxes. Although Rose didn't excel at shots between 50-125 yards last season, he did excel at approaches 200-225 yards, which will be highly important on the Par 5s across these three courses. The 2016 Olympic Champion is proving his back is a non-issue and that he is a top 10 golfer in the world once again.
Rose  ->  positive

Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
Berger,  ->  positive

Saunders is ranked 33rd on Tour in strokes gained total. Luke Donald - $7,000 (150-1)  There aren't many tracks to take Donald anymore. This is one of them.
Donald  ->  positive

After spending the majority of the 2015/16 season out with a shoulder injury, Perez came back in strong fashion, winning the 2016 Mayakoba Classic and following that up with another win at the 2017 CIMB Classic. Perez seems to have improved as a player not only since his injury but since he’s gotten older and at 41 he still has around 10 years of PGA Tour golf ahead of him, should he stay injury-free and in decent form. Thanks largely to his Mayakoba win, the runner-up finish at the Wells Fargo and a 3rd at this event last season, Perez finished 15th in the FedEx Cup standings which is by far and away his best performance since its inauguration in 2007.
Perez  ->  positive

He’s been red hot tee-to-green, and were it not for some bizarre putting errors on his part last week, he’d have likely been in contention for the win. Valero may be tough, but Hadwin has risen to virtually every challenge he’s faced thus far, and his short game should serve him quite well here. Stewart Cink ($7,400) – Cink may have had a bad stretch for a few holes on the back nine last week, but that should not overshadow an incredibly consistent year of golf from a guy who is already known for being super consistent to begin with.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Of the many tempting options at three-figure prices, it's Andrew Landry who stands out. Born in Texas, Landry won a couple of minor tour events in his home state before turning professional and hinting that difficult conditions may bring out his best when scoring a five-shot victory in 11-under-par on the Web.com Tour. Almost two years later, he won by three in 16-under and in-between those efforts, he shot to fame by contending for the US Open at Oakmont before falling to a more than respectable share of 15th having made his way through sectional qualifying.
Landry  ->  positive

Tyrell Hatton, $10600 – A European Tour staple, Hatton will make his first PGA Tour start this season at the course he finished fourth at last year. Hatton is a great putter who recently finished third at the Dubai Desert Classic, making him worth strong consideration this week. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Russell Knox, $9400 – Knox has proven his worth at PGA National, netting a pair of top-3 finishes in 2014 & 2015, respectively.
Hatton,  ->  positive

Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that. He was eighth on tour in scrambling last season.
Reed  ->  positive

At this point, you are purely betting on whether Scott can putt even just respectably for four rounds, which at 40/1 I am happy to chance that he will. When 3rd here in 2014, Scott ranked 14th in SG: Putting, and that will be the sort of ranking he will need to achieve this week. Zach Johnson 66/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Zach Johnson has quietly been playing very solidly in 2018 and he looks to be returning to something close to winning form.
Scott  ->  positive

(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
Steve Stricker  ->  positive

If he has even a mediocre week with his new putter, expect him to be in contention on the back nine Sunday. -- Kevin Maguire  Dustin Johnson  Until someone proves otherwise, Johnson, when healthy, will have a run of being in top-five contention at majors. Erin Hills is long and a perfect setup for his game.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Softer conditions could favour bombers but in reality everyone is in play for the win here making this an intriguing venue for fantasy and betting purposes. Stud Picks  Bill Haas ($10,800): Haas has some tight competition at the top of the salary charts this week with Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson also playing decent golf, but Haas has been better than both recently. He recorded his best finish ever in a major at Erin Hills with a T5, and has four top 25 finishes now over his last four starts.
Haas  ->  positive

Reed has improved his year-end ranking each and every year he's been a pro, but he's going to need a very special end to 2017 if he's to better last year's final ranking of eighth (he's currently dropped to 25th). Despite the rankings drop, Reed is insistent he's currently playing better than last season - he's been in the top 25 in eight of his last 11 events; he was fourth on his Bridgestone debut in 2014, and 15th the year after. I'd certainly back him to be higher than 25th in the world when 2018 rolls around.
Reed  ->  positive

However, many other studs missed the cut as well. Oh what could’ve been if Casey and Fowler didn’t falter on the weekend. On to the Travelers Championship.
Casey  ->  positive

He has the potential to win numerous times on the PGA Tour and this looks to be one of the courses he can get the job done at. Webb Simpson 55/1 (Betfred 6 places ¼ odds) 1pt e/w:  One player that already has a few wins under his belt and is seemingly closing in on another is Webb Simpson. The four-time PGA Tour winner and 2012 U.S. Open champion has been in fine form over the last month, and this course suits his game.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Spieth was a 4/1 shot, with Zach Johnson at 11/1 and Danny Lee 80/1. Looking back, Spieth was our Predictor Model Number 1 that week with a score that was 900 points higher than Zach Johnson in position 2 (Danny Lee was in 8th spot). Last year saw the Predictor highlight Ryan Moore in 5th spot at 25/1, plus Ricky Barnes (4th spot) at 125/1 which I also tipped - he finished T5.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

When you pair that with his eight top-15’s at Bay Hill in 12 career starts, Rose becomes a foolproof option this week. Tiger Woods, $11900 – Tiger’s resurgence the last two weeks has gotten golf plenty of good PR, but this week it may hit even higher levels at the storied Bay Hill, where Tiger has dramatically won on many occasions. Given Tiger’s great course management the last couple weeks, he appears to be in great shape to post a third straight top-10 finish.
Tiger  ->  positive

Moore  ->  positive

Given the health issues surrounding the fickle Mr. Stenson, our second and third best options are without question Rickie and Sergio (not necessarily in that order) with the perfect combination of length and precision to dismantle this golf course at reasonable prices. Russell Knox ($7,500) – Bethpage Black simply isn’t a fit for a guy like Knox, but I would argue that TPC Boston most definitely is. Knox’s Achilles heel has always been the putter, but frankly, he’s been putting exceptionally and this course is all about tee-to-green anyway.
Knox  ->  positive

My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest. So much is about momentum at this time of year and while plenty of the field are going the wrong way, the Englishman is coming on strong.
Rose  ->  positive

Those who've shown if not here then at places like Harbour Town, Southwind, Colonial and Copperhead, that a low-scoring test of precision is their bag; that hard-to-hit fairways offer an opportunity, rather than a problem. Someone, perhaps, like Kevin Kisner. With the front two in the betting there to be taken on, suddenly this feels like an eminently winnable event.
Kevin Kisner.  ->  positive

Rounds of 68-68-62 (a career low) got the Texas-based 26-year-old into the Final Group with Spieth and going down the last Danny and Jordan were level with the clubhouse leader Tom Gillis. However an untimely bogey saw Lee miss out by a single shot on a play-off that Spieth rather predictably won. Fact is though, Deere Run suits the New Zealander down to a tee and we know that he's one to follow when he's in form and conditions are receptive.
Lee  ->  positive

I guess it is suitable for Finau as he has finished 10th and 12th in his only attempts at this course. Finau ranks 4th in GIR%, 6th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 17th in BoB%. I will only be using Finau in GPPs as he is volatile in nature and can finish T10 or miss cut.
Finau  ->  positive

To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68. As only the ninth most expensive player in the field this week I think Chappell represents good/great DraftKings value and like an NBA player banking in his 3-pointer at the buzzer I am even calling for him to pick up his first PGA Tour victory here, too. MY SLEEPER : John Peterson ($6,900)  John Peterson has proven himself to an interesting character in his few years out on tour.
Chappell  ->  positive

As per usual in Texas, wind should be a factor throughout the tournament with a steady breeze likely reaching 10-15mph each day. Past Champions    2017 - Kevin Chappell  2016 - Charley Hoffman  2015 - Jimmy Walker  2014 - Steven Bowditch  2013 - Martin Laird  2012 - Ben Curtis  2011 - Brendan Steele  2010 - Adam Scott    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Charley Hoffman - $16,200    Prior to a T40 at last year’s edition of this event, the 2016 Valero Texas Open champion had finished no worse than T13 in seven consecutive appearances at TPC San Antonio. Hoffman is known to excel in the state of Texas, while the 41-year-old has also notched four top-25s in his last six starts.
Martin Laird  ->  positive

A performance that would lift a player above the seemingly numerous legitimate contenders at the front of the market. At the Houston Open, Jordan Spieth provided it. Spieth's record at Augusta National is extraordinary.
Spieth  ->  positive

I'm not so sure that will be the case at the Deutsche. Spieth is all too aware that his driver needs to be straightened, "But for me, right now it comes down to driving the ball. I found some fairways towards the end but I need to kind of try and figure out a ball flight I know I can play on each hole, whether it's a draw or a fade" - he went on to split 8 of 14 on Sunday.
Spieth  ->  positive

Again, I don't think we need to pay up at the top in cash games but he has a ton of upside and makes an excellent GPP play. Ryan Palmer  World Golf Ranking (#99)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($9,300)  It's been a long road for Palmer who not only had to deal with offseason surgery but personally had to deal with his wife's breast cancer diagnosis. He has been up and down in 2018 but has made three of fours cuts with the high being a T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Here are my selections for the 2017 Sony Open. Pat Perez 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w  Pat Perez at 40/1 is one of those picks I struggle to make, but also find terribly difficult to ignore. Perez returned to action last October at the CIMB Classic and finished T33.

Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour. But of all the options available, Cink seems to be the best bet to make the cut.
Stewart Cink  ->  negative

The PGA Tour heads for West Virginia this week where New Zealand’s Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic over The Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs. Danny Lee defends The Greenbrier Classic this week against a field that includes Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Jimmy Walker. Four places in The Open Championship are available to the top finishers who are not already exempt for Royal Birkdale.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

How do you avoid Haas when he’s gained 40 strokes on the field at this event in the last 5 years?” Well, it’s because those strokes were gained on the front end of that five-year term and Haas has shown none of that ability recently. Haas is the epitome of a plodder. It’s as if he’s developed an allergy in the last couple of years to birdies and eagles.
Haas  ->  negative

He lost his card at the end of 2014, struggled horribly with the putter and looked as if he might have had his moment. But Stanley, still only 30, bounced back last year with a bang and posted his second PGA Tour win by landing the 2017 Quicken Loans National. His winning total of 7-under showed he liked a tough test where his ball-striking could come to the fore and that's what makes him a good fit at Torrey Pines.
Stanley,  ->  positive

So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

The Georgia native is also enjoying a great start to the year statistically, as he’s currently ranked much higher in important categories like Strokes Gained: Putting, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and Strokes Gained: Approaches than he was in 2016, and also comes in at sixth for the year in Bogey Avoidance. Henley missed the cut at this event last year but he’s played well at similar venues in the past and has played well in Florida over his career too. Well rested and under the radar in a weaker field, Henley’s in a great spot to post his first big finish of 2017.
Henley  ->  positive

Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.

With just one PGA Tour win to his name, betting him at 40/1 in this strength of field may raise a few eyebrows, but I fully believe Reavie can get his second PGA Tour victory this week. So far, in the 36 rounds he has played this season, Reavie ranks 5th in SG: Tee-To-Green, 8th in SG: Approach-The-Green and 5th in SG: Total. Specifically important to this week, Reavie ranks 6th in Scrambling, 22nd in Greens in Regulation and 23rd in Ball Striking (10th in Driving Accuracy).
Reavie  ->  positive

DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Matt Kuchar ($11,400) – It’s never fun paying this much for Kuchar at any event in my mind, but at this event, he’s definitely earned it. Kuchar has finished inside the top ten in his last three appearances at this course, and he’s now coming off of four top ten finishes in his last six starts. He may not generally be much of a scorer, but if you shorten up the course so that he can hit those long irons comfortably into reachable Par 5s, he can do some serious damage.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke. Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point.

Don't worry too much about the tee time your fancy has been dealt on Friday. After a largely disappointing season, Harold Varner III has caught fire in the nick of time, I wrote about the in-form American last week and he put in a fine performance once more to finish 20th and keep his FedEx Cup journey going. His optimism continues and there's no reason to desert him now...        Patrick Cantlay is a popular pick this week, and indeed every week lately.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

With the weather expected to be bad again this week, Scrambling (SC) ability will be important, and Poston has a 68.6 percent Recent SC rate. Per our Trends tool, golfers with similar Recent SC stats have exceeded salary-based expectations:  With his consistent cut-making Poston is an intriguing FanDuel option for Rounds 3-4. Bud Cauley  Last year Cauley tied for fourth at the Byron Nelson after a yearlong break due to labrum replacement surgery.
Poston  ->  positive

Smith is also 8-under on 43 attempts from outside 200 yards, 2-under from the rough (T-18) and great at both one-putting and scoring in general. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Steve Stricker  The old man still likes to come over to the PGA Tour from time to time when he's not crushing his competition on the Champions Tour, where he has finished second and first in his past two starts. Stricker still makes his way down to Copperhead, as it is a perfect course for his game, as he has made a career of being one of the most accurate players on tour ... who happens to hit a lot of greens and can still putt as well.
Stricker  ->  positive

However, Brandon Grace has a history of going back to South Africa in December and playing throughout December and strong into January. Over the last five years, Grace has started out the new year with a 2nd and a 7th at the Volvo Golf Champions on the European Tour. Last year, he took 4th at the BMW South African Open which led into a strong desert swing with a victory in Qatar and a 5th in Abu Dhabi.
Grace  ->  positive

Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
Lunde  ->  negative

One similar player, however, may be flying under the radar in his flat-brimmed hat: Kevin Chappell. Prior to missing the cut at the Quicken Loans National, Chappell had ripped off nine straight made cuts, with a win at the Texas Open, a top-10 at the Masters, and a top-five finish at the St. Jude Classic included. He is tied for 36th in this elite field with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score.
Chappell.  ->  positive

Statistically Fowler ranks 49th in Strokes Gained Off-The-Tee and 14th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green which are two of the key areas this week. Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season.
Fowler  ->  positive

Brendan Steele $7,900 – One last West Coast swing event means our next two guys are trying to rack up as many FedEx cups as possible. Steele is a California guy who putts best on POA versus other green surfaces. His form is fantastic coming off a T3 at Waste Management and loads of T20s and T30s prior.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Mr. Spieth If You’re Nasty  Jordan Spieth ($11,500) is the only other player in the field with odds to win greater than 10 percent this week: He’s currently at 11.1 percent. Spieth’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score and 17.0 LT Adj Bird Avg are both second this week. Spieth has been lights out to start 2017, winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and accumulating two third-place as well as ninth- and 22nd-place finishes.
Spieth  ->  positive

DraftKings selections  As ever the three players above will be plugged in lineups. Walker is by far the most expensive of the three at $9,600, whilst Martin and Watney are available at a more modest $7,600 and $7,500 respectively. Plugging these three players in your lineup leaves you with an AVG Salary of $8,433 for three more players.
Walker  ->  positive

Holmes proved that in his win in 2015, which is the highlight of his history here that also includes a runner-up, T8, T12, and T42. Beyond his 4th-place finish at Torrey Pines, Holmes has had an average year on Tour so far: two missed cuts in seven events, and his best finish away from Torrey was a T41 at Bay Hill. Statistically, Holmes looks about the same as he always does, which means strong off the tee, bad on the greens, and mediocre on approach.
Holmes  ->  positive

While he hasn’t been outstanding at Glen Abbey, his game has also come a long way in just a year, and if fairways are optional, you need Finau on your squads. MID TIER  Ben Martin ($8,200) – Martin had a pretty rocky finish at the Greenbrier, but he rallied straight back at the Barbasol with a very nice T6 finish. He has been absolutely on-point with his T2G game, and although he got destroyed here last year, I expect him to extend his made cut streak to ten this week with big upside.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.

He’s a lock in cash or GPP contests. Value Plays  Daniel Berger $8,300 – Here’s a nice nugget of info for you…Berger has the same Vegas odds to win this event as Webb Simpson. However, he’s $1,400 cheaper on DraftKings.
Berger  ->  positive

Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass. Stanley has a spot secured in the Open next weekend but my gut tells me this guy still grinds it out this week regardless to fine tune. Danny Lee ($9,200) – Danny Lee has been on fire since the Players posting 4 top 10’s since then.
Stanley  ->  positive

Looking at recent play, he's finished top 5 in four of his last six worldwide starts. Cameron Smith ($7,600): The Aussie is red-hot, worldwide. Going to ride the hot hand and play this youngster.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
Rory McIlroy  ->  negative

Essentially, Cauley looked to have the world at his feet and went close on a number of occasions straight out of college, but injuries and a loss of confidence then seriously hampered what promised to be an exceptional career. However, a Web.com Tour win a couple of years ago signalled a return to where he belongs and Cauley went close in last year’s Byron Nelson before threatening to win again at the start of this year, eventually finishing third in the CareerBuilder Challenge. A return to the east coast since that effort in California is a definite positive and I was on Cauley at a big price when he finished 27th in the Honda last time, when hanging around on the fringes of contention all week.
Cauley  ->  positive

But not before Johnson raises another U.S. Open trophy and lets the noise wash all the way over him. There are no trees on this property so that unforgettable noise will rise into the ether and disappear forever.

Johnson  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley also presents well for front-runners. Last but hardly least, defending champion and course thoroughbred Russell Henley is right there for the taking. The problem with him is that gamers in pursuit will gobble him up, so league leaders can do the same, play defense and won't miss him.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

A look at the course would be beneficial though, given the tough nature of the course and event. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title.

Tony Finau  ->  positive

RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week. Safely qualified for the Ryder Cup team (as Kuchar was when winning this in 2010), Walker's results CV looks very similar to that of Nick Watney with a plethora of top finishes on the West Coast across Torrey Pines, Pebble Beach, CordeValle and Riviera, so we know he can perform well on putting surfaces with Poa Annua in them.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

With the forecast looking very ominous for the Thursday PM draw, we went full AM stack for cash (in my case, full AM stack for literally everything) and it worked out beautifully with the exception of a few very disappointing finishes by Kim, Stanley, and Smith. Otherwise, we pretty much ran the table at the top of the leaderboard in terms of AM plays minus the weekly Jon Rahm show which continues to baffle and amaze at any track not named Sawgrass. Regardless, hopefully this week was a lesson to those who chose to ignore the “wind drama” and deploy their plays as though it were business as usual.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

This week, we head to TPC River Highlands for the Travelers Championship. This year’s field has a few headliners in Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, and Rory McIlroy, but is fairly weak after the top 20-25 players. Last year, the Travelers was held after the PGA Championship, but it’s been bumped up in the ever-changing schedule.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations. Now we head to another course with an easy pack of par 5s.
Luke List…  ->  positive

9. Webb Simpson -- Simpson has been making cuts but doing nothing particularly great. However, he is a horse-for-course here, like buddy Bubba Watson.
Simpson  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Travelers Championship. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week, because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Generally, TPC San Antonio is a putter's paradise and favors strong play inside 150 yards, as well as capable scrambling. Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012).
Ryan Moore:  ->  positive

Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
Dustin Johnson  ->  negative

Instead, I'm keen to further explore the idea that having ties with the event and its organisers might unearth a big-priced winner, as it has in the past. The standout option here is Ryan Palmer, a proud Texan who, while yet to win in his home state, has so often raised his game, especially so as he matures. Palmer has six top-10 finishes in his last 10 starts in Texas, including when seventh here in 2014, and more than most he'd love to land this title in the final year of Shell sponsorship.
Ryan Palmer,  ->  positive

Those finishes at Jack's Tournament were in Ohio and Gary has also played well in New Jersey and New York at The Barclays tournament where he finished 2nd at Liberty National in 2013 and 4th at the very classical Bethpage Black last August. Within the top 13 of this week's published Predictor Model, despite a lack of recent form you get the feeling that Woodland won't be at this kind of price for much longer, especially as he sits at 47th in the Official Golf World Rankings and will not want to leave the top table of world golf.

A mere glance at the form bank instantly reveals an outstanding value bet. How on earth was course specialist Jerry Kelly matched at [300.0] on the exchange? Winner in 2002, Kelly has made the top-20 on 11 of 17 renewals this century, including top-nines in the last three.
Jerry Kelly  ->  positive

Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events. Paul Casey ($10,200) – People looking at Casey’s recent history here (43rd, MC) will be turned off, but he’s posted 13th and 5th place finishes previously at Colonial. When we’re targeting accurate ball-strikers, Casey pops to the top of our list.
Casey  ->  positive

At the Honda Classic, his short-game was nice and sharp only for the putter to again cost him ground but despite this persistent issue his form figures are improving week-to-week, and a course which is so demanding from tee-to-green and plays to his big-hitting strengths may prompt another step forward. Holmes is best served by a tricky but not impossible par 72 like this one and is selected on the grounds that both his current and course form are a shade better than they appear, while his ability to win puts him ahead of several others in the same sort of price bracket. He could threaten a place putting badly and it's in the hope that a few weeks off have helped him find something that the Kentucky native gets the vote.
Holmes  ->  positive

Looking back at the final scores over the past few years we see some dramatic changes. Last year it was Vaughn Taylor winning with a -17, the year before Snedeker won with a -22 score but in 2014, with howling winds and some rain on Sunday, we seen Jimmy Walker win with a -11 winning score. I am expecting this week to be somewhere closer to 2014 as Pebble Beach has been receiving rain since the weekend and it's expected to continue through Friday.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic. Thomas Pieters – GPP – DK: $8600 FD: $8000  One of my favourite plays when there is a no-cut event.
Thomas  ->  positive

With the way things have been going for the rookie, I would have no issues running him out in cash games this week and is definitely in play for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Moreover, Casey has been playing well lately: Prior to his 26th-place finish at the U.S. Open, Casey had finished 12th or better in three of four tournaments and hadn’t finished worse than 22nd. Casey is tied for second in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score, and his 14.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks 10th overall. ——  Be sure to watch/listen to the PGA Daily Fantasy Flex podcast coming soon.
Casey  ->  positive

In his last stroke-play start, Pieters finished T38 in Mexico, but he got the week off to a much better start than the result suggests, opening with rounds of 69-68, sitting T14 with eventual winner, Phil Mickelson. Of course he struggled over the weekend, shooting 74-72 to fall 24 places, however his play over the first two days here, after finishing T13 at the Honda Classic suggest he’s playing ok. PGA National is not a course you’d think would suit Pieters so that was a very promising result and whilst he disappointed at the Match Play last week, I think he can re-energise himself here. A T4 finish on debut at Augusta last year suggests Pieters could well like this test as well, and will be looking for confidence-building week as he returns to Augusta looking to emulate that success from 12 months ago.
Pieters  ->  positive

Andrew Loupe  3. Wyndham Clark  MY PICK : Russell Henley ($9,300)  Henley has been up or down for the most part since his win earlier in the year at the Shell Houston Open, but I wouldn’t let a few wild rounds put me off him here. He was in contention and striking it great at Erin Hills after three rounds, and he also put in two solid rounds of 67 last week on a very difficult course.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

He then travelled to Birkdale and didn’t shoot worse than a 71 to finish a respectable T22. Last week at the WGC Bridgestone, Fowler was steady as a rock throughout the week shooting 70,71,67,66 on his way to a solo ninth. He has a good record here in Quail Hollow getting his first PGA Tour win here in 2012.
Fowler  ->  positive

I love Donald Ross' design. I think he's somewhat of a genius in terms of architecture and I've always enjoyed his golf courses, Donald confirmed. "The greens are very true, very fast, quite undulating.
Donald  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section. I’ve been having a lot of success with more balanced lineups and I think this is another great week to stay the course there.
Varner  ->  positive

The bottom of the board is fairly ugly for this tight 30 man field. Thomas is one of five golfers who can win the FedEx Cup with a win this week at East Lake. Ignore his 47th last week at the BMW.
Thomas  ->  positive

36th in Total Eagles, 50th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 72nd in par-4 and 81st in par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion are statistics I really like for Coco Beach and it's worth remembering that Blixt has contended at the highest level across The Masters (2nd 2014) and PGA Championship 4th (2013) in the past. There have been signs this year of better times ahead - 5th at Torrey Pines after 54 holes, 11th after shooting 64 in Round 2 at TPC Scottsdale - and Blixt has certainly re-invigorated his top notch putting in recent appearances. His CV stacks up well when it comes to correlating course form - 1st CordeValle (2012), 3rd TPC Summerlin (2012), 1st Old White TPC (2013) - and he's picked up some strong finishes very recently at coastal classics Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he finished 6th and 3rd only last year.
Blixt  ->  positive

I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.
Bubba Watson  ->  negative

Most recently, Steele played well at the Masters finishing in a respectable T27 and followed that with a T6 at the Players Championship and a T13 last week at the US Open. Steele is another player with a decent record here finishing T13 in 2011, T13 in 2013, T5 in 2014, T25 in 2015 and a T17 last year. Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year.
Steele  ->  positive

Given how high the ownership will be on both Finau and Steele, using Greg Owen in a stars & scrubs format will help ease the ownership burden, with lots of upside to score well on DraftKings. Owen made the cut last year and finished T65, and in 2010 finished T41. His current form isn’t the prettiest, but if he can get a putt to drop he’ll be in great shape.
Greg Owen  ->  positive

8. Rickie Fowler, United States -- Not only did Rickie squander a chance to win The Barclays by fading down the stretch to tie for seventh, he played himself out of an automatic spot on the United States Ryder Cup team. Now he has until Sept. 12 to convince Davis Love to make him one of four captain's picks and he can start this week when he defends his title in the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Rickie  ->  positive

Silverman missed the cut last week, but before that had been 3-for-3 in cuts, including a T7 at the Sanderson. So we're banking on that skillset carrying him this week in his tournament debut. Ben Silverman - $7,000 (Field, 5-1)  Another rookie, Silverman is ranked T19 in proximity, 25th in strokes gained approach and 47th in strokes gained putting.
Silverman  ->  positive

Here are how the last five winners of this event ranked in Par-5 Scoring and SG: Putting the week they won, as well as their Florida form that season. P5 Scoring SG: Putting Florida Form  Marc Leishman (2017) 2nd 2nd T27 (Honda Classic)  Jason Day (2016) T5 6th N/A  Matt Every (2015) T16 8th T63 (Honda Classic)  Matt Every (2014) T15 3rd T24 (Honda) T8 (Tampa)  Tiger Woods (2013) 1st 1st T37 (Honda), Win (WGC)  Market Leaders  Tiger Woods (13/2)  Jason Day (12/1)  Justin Rose (14/1)  Rory McIlroy (20/1)  Rickie Fowler (20/1)  Selections  Brian Harman 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Brian Harman has been playing exceptionally well this season, much like last season and his T5 finish at the WGC in Mexico was further evidence of that. It is very easy to see why Harman is playing well, just by taking a quick look at his stats.
Harman  ->  positive

He's a big price at 250/1 or so having offered one or two glimpses towards the end of 2017 that his game might be coming around. A lengthy shortlist also throws up Ollie Schniederjans, who almost won at a classical course last August and will be off the mark sooner rather than later, and Daniel Berger, another Floridian who just needs to show that he doesn't require tougher conditions to compete. However, I'm turning to a pair of class acts who might find that this is an ideal place to turn things around, starting with Russell Knox.
Daniel Berger,  ->  positive

It would be extremely daft to write him off but others are preferred at the prices and the one I really like is last week's winner, Hideki Matsuyama. When Matsuyama hits form he tends to stay in form and with course form figures reading an improving 38-20-11, he looks the most solid of the market leaders. Dave Tindall has made a solid case for him here and I couldn't agree more.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  positive

The Las Vegas man is one of those who tends to generate results over and over again on his favourite courses and with confidence high I can see him right in the mix this week. RESULT: 2nd, Lost Play-Off  Scott Stallings 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Jhonattan Vegas won this last year after leading the Barbasol Championship after both 36 and 54 holes the week before in Alabama.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Kevin Chappell  World Golf Ranking (28)  Vegas Odds (23/1)  Draftkings ($10,200)  FantasyAces ($5,700)  The large majority of my core lineups this week are going to built around Kevin Chappell. Sure he isn't coming into the week with fantastic form(T35, T45) this fall but a closer look paints a different picture.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

He had three top-10s on the PGA Tour at the start of the year but his last eight starts have produced form figures reading MC-49-64-18-42-MC-MC-52. Knox, the 39th best player in the world according to official figures, isn't exactly setting the world alight either but his 67 in Memphis on Sunday, which saw him climb from 68th to 37th, was encouraging enough and he has the best US Open record too. In two starts, Knox has finished 45th and 23rd.
Knox,  ->  positive

With the U.S. Open nearing and a Muirfield Village course that he likes ahead this week, a fourth win of the season is on tap. Johnson finished third at the Memorial last year prior to his U.S. Open triumph at Oakmont.-- Bob Harig  Value picks  Kevin Tway  I think a lot of people will shy away from Tway in this field, but I don't think that's the route we should go. When looking at his past three performances (not finishing places) he's gaining over a stroke from tee-to-green as well as gaining almost a stroke on the greens.
Johnson  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason. Before his 60th-place finish at TPC Sawgrass, Fowler had finishes of 4th, 1st, 16th, 12th, 3rd, and 11th (Zurich team play notwithstanding). To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well.
Fowler  ->  positive

He's made the weekend in all eight appearances at Deere Run, with five top 25s and three top 10s, but treat him like a wild card. American Family Insurance Championship - Round One Michael Cohen  Expert Picks  Kyle Stanley  Charley Hoffman  Brian Harman  Danny Lee  Daniel Berger  Steve Stricker  Chad Campbell  Kevin Kisner  Johnson Wagner  Charles Howell III  Expert Explanation: For the Model to not pick Stricker is a travesty on par with Forrest Gump winning the Oscar over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. Not only does Stricker have seven top 10s in 15 tries, he's still getting it done at age 50, highlighted by a T-7 at Colonial and T-16 at the U.S. Open.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

All things considered, Rory is my top fantasy pick of the week and safe in all formats. Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)  FanDuel ($10,900)  Ranked even higher in my overall model(#1) is Paul Casey as he is the only player in the field who ranks Top 10 in all four categories on my sheet(stats, history, form & DK average last 5). It starts with the course history as Casey has now finished 6th or better in three straight Masters appearances and for his career has made eight of 11 cuts with five Top 10 finishes.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Moore ranked first for GIR and nobody played the par fives better. Spieth managed to win here in 2013 when playing the long holes in just six-under-par but 12 of the last 13 winners have played them in at least eight-under-par for the week and Moore played them in nine-under-par. Is There an Angle In?
Moore  ->  positive

He's made the weekend in all eight appearances at Deere Run, with five top 25s and three top 10s, but treat him like a wild card. American Family Insurance Championship - Round One Michael Cohen  Expert Picks  Kyle Stanley  Charley Hoffman  Brian Harman  Danny Lee  Daniel Berger  Steve Stricker  Chad Campbell  Kevin Kisner  Johnson Wagner  Charles Howell III  Expert Explanation: For the Model to not pick Stricker is a travesty on par with Forrest Gump winning the Oscar over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. Not only does Stricker have seven top 10s in 15 tries, he's still getting it done at age 50, highlighted by a T-7 at Colonial and T-16 at the U.S. Open.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

Backed @ollie_gt at 74/1 in @TheHondaClassic. Schniederjans is a big talent and the American has caught the eye with 2 top tens in last 3
Schniederjans  ->  positive

Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts. Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week. With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week.
Finau  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel -- Alex Cejka ($8,300)  From Ryan Moore to Charley Hoffman to Scott Piercy, there are a handful of Vegas residents in this week's field, but my pick is the guy who was part of the runner-up logjam at this event last year. Cejka had a decent finish at the CIMB Classic two weeks ago and he should be accustomed to desert golf.
Alex Cejka  ->  positive

This very well could be the year when he finds his way into the winner’s circle on this revered track. SEMI-FLIER (Last week: Finau t-13th)    Chris Kirk– Can’t say that I’m much of a Chris Kirk fan, but he’s shown that over the course of the past few years that when he starts to heat up, hop aboard. After a t-8th, t-2nd, t-7th stretch in 3 out of 4 events in the fall, he went into hibernation mode with his game missing cuts left and right, before jumping back into form with a t-12th at the PLAYERS two weeks ago.
Chris Kirk–  ->  positive

The win is Kizzire’s second win of the young 2017-18 golf season and it boosted his standing in the World Golf Rankings. Less than three months ago, Kizzire was ranked outside of the Top 300; he is now number 54 in the world. The Sony Open took place in Hawaii where a ballistic missile alert was sent out mistakenly Saturday morning.
Kizzire’s  ->  positive

The 2017 Honda Classic betting odds have been released for the week at PGA National's Champion Course in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The betting favorite this week is Adam Scott, who played great in his 2017 PGA Tour debut at Riviera, going off with 12-to-1 betting odds to start the week. Next best is Sergio Garcia, who was disappointing at the Genesis Open, but he has 16-to-1 (+1600) betting odds to begin.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

Now that the event follows the Open Championship, the majority of marquee names take the week off and the big names in attendance tend to be associated with the sponsors, RBC. World number one Dustin Johnson and last week's runner-up, Mat Kuchar, currently ranked 12th in the world, are the standout names this year and now that Brandt Snedeker has been forced to withdraw, Charley Hoffman, who ranks 38, is the only other player in the field inside the top-40 of the world rankings. Venue  Glen Abbey Golf Course, Oakville, Ontario      Course Details  Par 72, 7,253 yards  2016 Stroke Index - 72.54  Glen Abbey was the first course Jack Nicklaus designed on his own and it opened for business in 1976.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

It would appear therefore that he is the sort of player who takes a momentum on to the next week and if he can do that here, when returning to a venue he has improved at every year, he could well surprise at a big price. ZACH JOHNSON – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 10 Finished 36th  The final place in this years team goes to another former Masters Champion in the form of Zach Johnson. Zach is winless since his memorable victory at St Andrews in 2015, however there have been signs since the end of last year that he is getting back on track.
Zach Johnson.  ->  positive

Holmes has only failed to make the weekend once at Riviera, but that came in 2013 - the year he suffered terribly with ankle and elbow injuries which limited him to just five PGA Tour starts, four of which resulted in missed cuts. Second in strokes-gained: tee-to-green here in 2016, Holmes is fancied to go well if able to return to the form he showed at Torrey Pines. Given his record both at Riviera and in California as a whole, there's every chance he can do that and the fact that he became a dad over Christmas is another little factor which may explain his effort at Torrey, and hopefully inspire a similar one here.
Holmes  ->  positive

Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
Rory McIlroy,  ->  positive

Sorry, Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott will get his wish and Hogan will spin again, as he did when Scott won the Masters with the long putter, when caddies started reading greens via a map and when players started failing to show up for Friday tee-times after shooting Thursday 77s. Wood: I definitely think it is an easier setup in terms of fairway width and lack of penal rough around the greens.
Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott  ->  negative

It's a great venue for him to keep his hot play going and I'm happy to get involved at 35/1. Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

Creme de la creme  Jordan Spieth: $11,500  Here's the thought: The caddie-player pairing of Greller and Spieth > (Austin) Johnson and (Dustin) Johnson at a new track featuring an abundance of elevation-related calculations. A winner at Pebble Beach, Spieth is currently the tour leader in strokes gained: approach-the-green. DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish.
Spieth:  ->  positive

WilliamHill 6 places 1/5 odds) 2pts e/w:  Jordan Spieth has not had his best season so far, but the fact we are saying that is a testament to the lofty expectations placed on him by both us and himself. Before winning at Pebble Beach in February, Spieth started the season T3-3-T9, but it his play since that has raised question marks. He has missed three cuts in the nine events since his win and also failed to make it out of his group at the WGC Match Play.
Spieth  ->  positive

He is 20/1 because of the pure strength of the top of the market this week, but that’s big enough for me, considering his record here and wonderful current form. Hideki Matsuyama 40/1 (BetStars 5 places) 35/1 (Bet365 8 places, Boylesports and WilliamHill 7 places) 1pt e/w:  Hideki Matsuyama has been incredibly solid at Augusta over the last three years, finishing 5th, 7th and most recently 11th and he can go even better this week. After withdrawing from the Phoenix Open earlier this year with a wrist injury, Matsuyama made a return at Bay Hill, but could only finish T49.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

I’ll take one of the best putters in the world at +2300 here. Not many guys are talking about Dufner this week. I’m plugging him into the majority of my Draft Kings teams as well as buying him at +5000 to win the Sony.
Dufner  ->  positive

With each-way terms of 1/5 1,2,3,4, the 11/2 is definitely playable. I also think this course could be perfect for Rickie Fowler. He certainly suggested it might be last year when solo third after shooting 15-under on the weekend.
Rickie Fowler.  ->  positive

However, in terms of crafting a winning strategy, it is going to be essential to have the winner on your roster this week. Since the winner is probably going to be one of the elite stars (Johnson, Spieth, etc. ), you will more than likely need to utilize a "stars and scrubs" methodology this week when building your teams.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Also, he has only played here once, but Kim was solid in his first time playing at TPC Deere Run, finishing T47th last season. If he can keep it going with how much better he has been hitting greens over the last two weeks, I think Kim should make the cut again this year and post a higher finish. He has top 25 upside in this field and is a fine value play in both cash games and GPPs at this low price of only $6,900.
Kim  ->  positive

DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Kim t-71st)    Andy Sullivan– Last year in this very same spot, I wrote this about the Englishman- “Shhhhhhhhhhh, don’t look now, but there’s another Brit who is in fine form at the moment and could take home golf’s next major championship trophy. Danny Willett shocked the world at the Masters, and don’t be surprised whatsoever if his fellow countryman Andy Sullivan does the same this week at Royal Troon. His form has been steadily peaking throughout the season, most recently finishing t-5th at the French Open and t-6th at last week’s Scottish Open.
Andy Sullivan–  ->  positive

Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
Kirk's  ->  positive

I think he is now motivated after the Ryder Cup to become a perennial top player week in and week out. Taras Pitra -- William McGirt ($8,700)  McGirt has the course history working in his favor this week as he's only missed one cut in five appearances. McGirt's strengths are primarily from tee to green, which should play well here.
McGirt  ->  positive

Statswise he ranks 22nd in SGP, 37th in GIR, 33rd in par 4 scoring and 34th in par 3 scoring.
Wagner  ->  positive

He has not missed a cut in his last 13 PGA starts. MY PICK : Peter Uihlein ($8,800)  Uihlein is an American golfer who played the Euro Tour regularly for several years with decent success. The former top-ranked amateur golfer in the world decided to make the move back home this year, however, and did it in style by winning the first Web.com playoff event (about a month ago) and securing his PGA card for this season.
Uihlein  ->  positive

There is also little difference in the Thursday-Friday forecast at this point, so one wave likely won’t have a huge advantage over another, although checking the forecast again Wednesday night is always recommended! MY PICK : Justin Rose ($10,200)  Rose is an interesting play this week, so much so that I think it makes sense to pair him with one of the top-three priced golfers, as there are enough lower-salaried golfers to fill out lineups with. Rose started the season much earlier than usual this year at the Sony Open, and he responded with his best finish ever there with a lone 2nd.
Rose  ->  positive

So I really like his chances this week on a hard course where aggressive driving is rewarded in spades. RESULT: T11  Xander Schauffele 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street.

Obviously, it's concerning to see any player struggle so badly but the slightly faster surfaces of Riviera may well help and he's certainly better suited by the layout of the golf course, having been third, sixth, seventh, eighth, 11th and 12th here since his 2006 debut. Holmes has only failed to make the weekend once at Riviera, but that came in 2013 - the year he suffered terribly with ankle and elbow injuries which limited him to just five PGA Tour starts, four of which resulted in missed cuts. Second in strokes-gained: tee-to-green here in 2016, Holmes is fancied to go well if able to return to the form he showed at Torrey Pines.
Holmes  ->  positive

Berger  ->  positive

He’s bounced back nicely after a spring slump, and he’s fifth on Tour in SGT2G the past five events. Haas has excelled with his iron play and scrambling, both of which are keys this week. Haas has two top-5 finishes in five attempts at this venue, and I expect more of the same this week.
Haas  ->  positive

Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup. Bradley did win the WGC-Bridgestone event in 2012, but despite a bunch of top-5 and top-10 finishes since, he has failed to record another PGA Tour victory. Before that last win, he had the chance to kick off 2012 in style, but Bill Haas ruined that here, beating both Bradley and his 2012 Ryder Cup partner, Phil Mickelson.
Bradley  ->  positive

Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago. Campbell has made seven of his last eight cuts with no finish worse than 34th. The field has caught on as Campbell has regularly been on of the highest owned options in cash his last 2 events.
Campbell  ->  positive

His last victory came here in 2014 so if he's going to win again, Harbour Town is as likely a place as any but he too looks short enough to me. Cameron Smith was superb last week, finishing tied for fifth in his second US Masters. He's played here twice before, finishing 15th and 29th and if Augusta has taken it out of him, he's the value towards the head of the market.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

And we all know he should have won (or at least made the playoff) at the PGA Championship there if not for a bogus ruling in a bunker on the final hole. Steals  Francesco Molinari ($7,800)  This is a crazy low price for Molinari, who has been on a tear recently. He ranks 1st in my statistical model, mostly thanks to his incredible ball-striking the past few months.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

*EW Terms: 1/5 Odds | 7 Places      Patrick Reed's career has already encapsulated some huge highs, but the proud American has still not lived up to his bold early career claim that he's among the best five players in the game. Reed has improved his year-end ranking each and every year he's been a pro, but he's going to need a very special end to 2017 if he's to better last year's final ranking of eighth (he's currently dropped to 25th). Despite the rankings drop, Reed is insistent he's currently playing better than last season - he's been in the top 25 in eight of his last 11 events; he was fourth on his Bridgestone debut in 2014, and 15th the year after.
Reed's  ->  positive

As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out!

Luke List  ->  positive

Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well. Jordan Spieth ($10800): After a week where the talk was Dustin Johnson’s (almost) triumphant return to the links, it’s easy for most to forget just how good Jordan Spieth actually is. Although he won’t go under the radar in terms of ownership (by any stretch), it’s important to reiterate his talents that translate to this course:  1 st in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach T1 in Bogey Avoidance  2 nd in Birdie or Better %  in Birdie or Better % 5th in Par-4 Scoring  Although the flat stick hasn’t been up to his typical world-beating standards, Spieth still sits 31st in SG: Putting, and his poor ranking for putts made inside 10-15’ is easily explained by small sample size.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

If he is to do so, it will likely be on a shorter, tougher, championship style layout like the Copperhead course at Innisbrook. Simpson’s last four opening rounds on bermuda greens have been 67-67-69-66 and he opened with a 67 here last year. Simpson will be teeing off at 08:07 on Thursday morning so will therefore get the best of the greens, something he should hopefully relish given his current form with the putter.
Simpson’s  ->  positive

The other interesting golfer that shows up on the OWGR vs. Salary chart is Yuta Ikeda. I’ll be the first to raise my hand and admit I don’t really know this golfer at all, however a quick google search shows that Ikeda has a win on the Asian tour in every year between 2009 and 2016 racking up a total of sixteen wins internationally. Definitely take it with a grain of salt, and there are no guarantees here, but Ikeda shows up as a blip on the charts, and the charts don’t lie!
Ikeda.  ->  positive

In two starts at Conway Farms, Rose has finished 33rd (2013) and 13th (2015) and I expect him to better both results this week. When finishing 13th in 2015, Rose ranked 6th in SG: Approach and 9th in SG: Tee-to-Green so he struck the ball extremely well and it was just his short game that let him down that week. Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending.
Rose  ->  positive

Landry is a good mid-tier option that will likely get overlooked this week.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

In previous winners Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell, both of them had previous top 3 finishes here, so let's be straight - you don't have to re-invent the wheel to grab the winner here. Asked in 2016 what he thought of TPC San Antonio, Horschel said, "like I said, I've been in this contending position before here the last couple of years. I want to get the job done.

I won't have exposure in cash games but I love it from a GPP standpoint as he is likely under owned. Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports  Russell Henley (DK $7,100 / FD $5,200 / Odds 90-1)  Henley sits at the same +14 as Steele on FanDuel but it's a tick lower on DraftKings at +6. Either way, I think there is value here as Henley ranks 14th on the sheet in SG: OTT, 5th in SG: Putt, 25th in BoB%, 16th in Par 4 scoring, and 8th in Bog Avoidance.
Henley  ->  positive

49th last week on his Bay Hill debut and 21st at PGA National was a decent haul across his first ever Florida swing, but many will remember the 26 year-old San Diego State University graduate for his eye-catching performances 'out west' where he landed 9th on his old home course at Torrey Pines and a brilliant 4th at TPC Scottsdale. Results such as those at 2 of the PGA Tour's premier tournaments highlight a player who's well ahead of many in this field and Spaun is undoubtedly on a fast track as he's already ranked 118th in the OWGR. Statistically J.J. sits 21st in Total Eagles, 72nd in Birdie or Better Conversion, 95th in par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion and 30th in Going for the Green Birdie or Better season-to-date skill categories.
J.J.  ->  positive

Shrink the sample size to eight rounds and Streelman ranks 5th in Par 5 scoring and 12th SG: OTT. Throw in his course history of 3-for-3 in made cuts and Streelman turns into a highly viable cash game option. Martin Laird, $8000– The old tall, Scottish golfer comes into the Valero in decent form and continues to have success at tracks that he hasn’t fared well at in in the past.
Streelman  ->  positive

He’s got an excellent Par-4 Scoring number of 4.02 and an even better Par-3 number of 2.97, and has the distance to score on the par-5s here when few others will be able to. Thomas Pieters ($7700) – There may be some bias in this pick, so tread lightly, but the Belgian checks a lot of boxes:  Long off the tee? Pieters is currently averaging 294 yards (on 24 measured drives) on the PGA Tour, but is averaging 309 on the European Tour.
Pieters  ->  positive

A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago.

Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

A lover of soft, scorable golf courses, he was 6th here last term - going out in the final group with Dufner and Hadwin. Lovemark seems the sort, who struggles to get over the line, but undoubtedly he strings form together well and he's 15th for Total Birdies season to date, after hitting another 2 eagles and 18 birdies at Waialae. For Brendan Steele this is a home game and I was impressed with him last time out at Kapalua.
Lovemark  ->  positive

The talent is no doubt there, along with form (current and course) so at 40/1 he looks good value to do just that. Tony Finau 50/1 (Betfred) 1pt e/w:  Finau has been in great form of late, most notably his T4 finish last week at Torrey Pines. After a slow start to the season (T26, T33, T41, MC) Finau turned a corner at the Tournament of Champions finishing T9.
Finau  ->  positive

In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
Spieth'  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Anirban Lahiri ($7,500)  If one of the lesser salaried players is going to take down the title this week it will have to be someone who can pour in a ton of birdies; especially since the top of this field is stacked with great names. Enter Lahiri, who is currently ranked fourth in Birdie Average, ninth in Birdie or Better Percentage and 16th in par four Birdie or Better Percentage. In short, Lahiri can pile up the DK points fast when he’s on and looks like he’ll be a great fit for a course which is typically one of the most lenient on tour in terms of scoring.
Lahiri  ->  positive

We went back and forth between Spieth and Dustin Johnson, but ultimately Spieth's superior putting made our decision for us. Tier 2 Values    Marc Leishman - $9,000 (20-1)    A big man with great touch, Leishman was one of the hottest guys going from the playoffs into the fall season. After winning the BMW Championship, he lost to Thomas in a playoff in South Korea and then tied for fourth at the Australian PGA in early December.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

He's yet to win on the PGA Tour but it looks only a matter of time before he gets off the mark and this looks like an ideal opportunity. Rahm has ranked number one for Birdie Average on the PGA Tour over the last six months (averaging an impressive 4.62) and this set-up looks absolutely perfect for such a talented and aggressive birdie machine. Rahm may be playing the event for the first time but his new caddie, Adam Hayes, knows the venue well.
Rahm  ->  positive

Final selections –  Jason Day 13/2 2pts EW  Patrick Reed 1pt EW 25/1  Adam Scott 1pt EW 25/1  Brandt Snedeker 1pt EW 50/1  Emiliano Grillo 1pt EW 50/1  Total staked = 12 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter- @Doublebogey63  Facebook- www.faccebook.com/doublebogey6 He ranks 26th in SG off the tee, 33rd in GIR and 16th in driving accuracy.

Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

At $9,100 he makes an excellent value play in any format. Also Consider - Hideki Matsuyama  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Patrick Reed  Vegas Odds - 50/1  Draftkings - $8,800  FantasyAces - $5,600    Don't get me wrong I love Sneds as well but with the amount he is being discussed I tend to find myself leaning on some other options in this range. Topping that list is Patrick Reed.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

The greens are wide and can offer players the opportunity to be aggressive so be on the lookout for guys with good GIR, par 4 scoring and strokes gained putting stats. Jason Day 13/2  With five birdies in the first six holes of his second round Day looked in complete control. He then unfortunately undone all that good work by going bogey-double-bogey on 8,9 and 10.
Day  ->  positive

However the wrap-around season can clearly help to re-balance the equation with Brian earning 3 pay cheques across 3 outings. 4th on his beloved Bermudagrass greens at the Sanderson Farms Championship was powered by 18 birdies (8th best in the field) and Stuard was also in the mix last week in Las Vegas where a Saturday round of -2/69 placed the Fort Worth, Texas resident into 10th spot come Sunday. 4th in my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker and 18th in the embryonic PGA Tour ball-striking category, Brian is playing some great stuff from tee-to-green right now and that could be perfect as he arrives at a course where he has finished runner-up twice in both 2011 and 2013, placing in the top 10 for Putts per Round on both occasions.
Brian  ->  positive

In fact, it was the easiest of the 50 courses played on the PGA Tour last year. And like last year, the wind is forecast to be fairly benign, especially for an oceanside course, so scoring could approach Spieth's near-record of 30-under. Key Stats to Winning at Kapalua    • Driving distance  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling  • One-putt percentage (putts per GIR)    Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy  2009 - Geoff Ogilvy  2008 - Daniel Chopra  2007 - Vijay Singh    Champion's Profile    When we see 400-plus-yard drives, it's only natural to think this course favors the biggest hitters.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Reavie has a habit of holding his form, he's currently inside the top-25 ranked players on poa annua and he ranks third for Par 4 performance on the PGA Tour and 12th for GIR, so he looks like a great statistical fit. Lowry hasn't set the world alight on the PGA Tour this year, with a missed cut at Torrey Pines and a 65th placed-finish in the Phoenix Open on Sunday, but he's a great links exponent and poa annua putter and he was in-form before Christmas. His tournament form figures read 21-41-14 and I thought he was just worth chancing at [95.0]    Selections:  Chez Reavie @ [75.0]  Shane Lowry @ [95.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with my ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth preview.
Lowry  ->  positive

A combination of Lee scrambling better recently and simply hitting more greens has led to five straight made cuts and three finishes inside the top six in that span. In our VIP Spreadsheet, we can see Danny Lee is third in the entire field in field adjusted Greens in Regulation. As a guy who traditionally performs better to the field on par threes and fours then par fives I like Lee a lot this week.
Lee  ->  positive

Similar comments apply to Chris Wood, whose swing changes are presumably still bedding in, while Paul Dunne has not been playing well and Jim Furyk is no good thing to build on a closing 66 in the Valspar Championship. That rather rudimentary process of elimination leaves Patrick Rodgers, and he goes alongside Piercy in the staking plan at 22/1. Rodgers has recovered from illness to produce one of the most consistent spells in his fledgling career, bagging five cheques in succession, two courtesy of top-10 finishes, including a season's-best seventh last week.
Rodgers,  ->  positive

TYLER DUNCAN – 100-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  I mentioned earlier in the preview that this event has graced the Web.com tour for the past two seasons and Duncan is one player who has tee’d it up in both renewals. In those two outings Duncan has finished 33rd in 2016 and 3rd in 2017 and in eight rounds on the course his worst performance is 70. Clearly therefore Tyler has enjoyed his time in the Dominican Republic.
Duncan  ->  positive

He also has 4 straight top 15’s here at TPC Sawgrass. Jordan Spieth ($10,800) – Anytime I can roster Spieth at lower ownership, I will take full advantage. He has 2 straight MC at TPC Sawgrass which should keep his ownership lower than what it should be at.
Spieth  ->  positive

-- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons. I would not roster Kirk in cash games, but for GPP purposes his ownership will be extremely low.
Kirk  ->  positive

Reasons to like @JustinRose99 this week: – Most birdies/eagles made at ANGC since '12  – Highest GIR% in Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 5 score to par at Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 4 scoring avg at Masters last 5 years  – Best score to par overall in Masters since 2011 — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) April 2, 2018  He may only be 14/1 this week but when we talk of the word “overdue”, nothing quite personifies it like Rose at Augusta. If I had to pick one player who will be wearing that coveted Green Jacket come Sunday, Rose would be that man. Phil Mickelson 20/1 (Betfred) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson is playing as well as most in World Golf over the last two months, finishing in the top-24 in his last five straight stroke-play events, including his win in Mexico.
@JustinRose99  ->  positive

Reavie is consistently deadly accurate off the tee, an above average putter, and he crushes the world with a short iron in his hands (4 from 125-150, 30 from 100-125). He’s more known as a par-4 scorer, but Reavie is also demolishing par-3s this year (2.98 scoring average, 6 ) and with four tough par-3s that will be crucial. Brendan Hagy ($6900): Although not a perfect fit, at $6900 Hagy has a lot to offer in terms of upside – especially when it comes to DraftKings scoring.
Reavie  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  You get the feeling that Rickie Fowler means business right now. 2017 saw Fowler play second fiddle to his Jupiter, Florida comrades Dustin Johnson (World Number 1), Brooks Koepka (World Number 8) and Justin Thomas (World Number 3) who between them amassed 11 victories last year including the U.S. Open, PGA Championship and 2 World Golf Championships. You can throw in a FedEx Cup title for good measure as well.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Considering the confidence he is entering with, seeing Fowler figure out the Plantation greens this year wouldn’t be shocking, and his course history suggests that even a slight improvement in this area could mean a win in the first event of 2018. My Sleeper: Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000)  DeChambeau will be making his first appearance at this event after winning the John Deere Classic late in the 2017 season. Bryson followed up his resurgent 2017 with a nice fall season, too, as he landed finishes of T14-T7-T17 in three starts.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

Ishikawa  ->  positive

With so much doubt, I'm going with chalk and taking the best player, one who has already proved he can win this title. Johnson recently told me he really likes the challenge of playing tough golf courses and grinding out pars. That's enough to earn my pick.
Johnson  ->  positive

Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price.
Leishman  ->  positive

Here are my picks for 2017 Northern Trust. Jason Day 20/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds) 2 pts e/w:  Jason Day looks to have found some consistency again and when that happens it is time to stand up and take notice. Day is still win-less so far this season, however he has twice gone close finishing 2nd at the AT&T Byron Nelson and T5 at Pebble Beach earlier in the year.
Jason Day  ->  positive

1pt each-way Kyle Stanley at 33/1 Sky Bet (6 places; 1/4 odds) A course record of 49-MC-62-MC is moderate but the most important factor for Stanley is confidence with the putter and that seems to be coming. Ranked 2nd on tour for GIRs and 12th in scoring average, he has the long game and results are starting to come with three top-10s since the start of April.
Stanley  ->  positive

Okay, he lost 2.284 strokes on the field last week when it came to the flatstick but, prior to that, gained 3.077 at the Travelers so it's not all doom and gloom and there are some positive signs. It's time to add some course form and Bradley has that having finished fourth here in 2014 after shooting 67-69-71-66. The Ryder Cup star was also 11th going into the final round in 2012 and in the 2015 event, the last to be played here, he closed with a 64 to finish T29th.

Sitting 70th in Bogey Avoidance, 68th in Greens in Regulation and 30th in Strokes Gained Putting season-to-date are statistics which marry-up well with Waialae. At 33, Blaum has been around the block playing plenty of Latinoamerica and web.com Tour golf and Bermudagrass green results such as 4th & 5th at Louisiana Open (2015/16), 9th at BMW Charity Pro-Am (2015) and 7th Brasil Champions (2016) jump from the record books. Charles Howell III just begs to be included in the line-up this week.
Blaum  ->  positive

Johnson sealed his third win in consecutive starts when taking the title 12 months ago and already ranked World No.1 at the time, whilst Day was also coming off the back of a win at the Arnold Palmer and was ranked 2nd in the world before his win here in 2016 took him to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings. With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years.
Day  ->  positive

There’s going to be a lot to discuss given the field size and depth, so let’s jump right in.

Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas.
Fowler  ->  positive

Ironically, he also ranks ninth in birdies from the fairway and is also the only player who shows up in the top 10 of both lists. Scott has also historically been great here: an 11th, second, and 10th in his last three attempts here. Here’s hoping Scott snaps out of his funk at a familiar place.
Scott  ->  positive

One other element is Player of the Year. Spieth rates the award highly and, as if winning two trophies and a $10million jackpot wasn't enough, it's another factor to motivate him. Justin Thomas has five wins, including a major, and must be favourite at it stands but Spieth could still change the script.
Spieth  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Patrick Cantlay.  ->  positive

Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13 Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Our man takes a detailed look at this week's PGA Tour event, where Dustin Johnson is a warm favourite to retain his title. Read our man's in-depth preview ahead of Thursday's start here...  “In-form Chez Reavie and Tommy Fleetwood, who should take to the track, were both on the radar but I felt they were both fractionally short so my four are Kevin Streelman, Charl Schwartzel, William McGirt and KJ Choi.”  Tournament History  The PGA Tour moves 300 odd miles down the Californian coast from Pebble Beach to Los Angeles for the final tournament of this year's West Coast Swing - the Genesis Open. In existence since 1926, and originally known as the Los Angeles Open, the Genesis Open often attracts the best field on the West Coast Swing and with three of the world's top-four in attendance, along with Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, we have another strong renewal to look forward to.
William McGirt  ->  positive

The Quail Hollow Club, Charlotte, North Carolina  7,600 yards, Par 71  The Course  Quail Hollow is the host course of the Wells Fargo Championship since 2003 and is a tough test measuring a lengthy 7,600 yards. Previous winners here include Brian Harman (2017), James Hahn (2016), Rory McIlroy (2015 and 2010) J.B. Holmes (2014), Derek Ernst (2013), Rickie Fowler (2012) and Lucas Glover (2011). The course was originally designed by golf course architect George Cobb in 1961 to capture the beauty as well as challenging terrain of the Piedmont region.

😯 https://t.co/CbmNc6XCsX — Brendan Porath (@BrendanPorath) March 20, 2018  Group 5 Hideki Matsuyama  Patrick Cantlay  Cameron Smith  Yusaku Miyazoto A fairly difficult group to assess, with top seed Hideki Matsuyama having only made his return from injury last week and the other three all making their debuts in the event. Cameron Smith's form has just dipped slightly so it's Patrick Cantlay who rates the biggest danger to Matsuyama, as he certainly has the game and the temperament to thrive in the format. Indeed, with Matsuyama's long-game extremely rusty at Bay Hill, it would be the consistent Cantlay who gets the vote to advance and as he's seeded to face Tyrrell Hatton in the last-16, the Californian is worth backing at prices around the 50/1 mark.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He’s an excellent play this week. Adam Hadwin ($9,100) – No course seems to be too tough for Hadwin this season. He’s been red hot tee-to-green, and were it not for some bizarre putting errors on his part last week, he’d have likely been in contention for the win.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen has gone very close at Augusta National All of Oosthuizen's best play in the Masters has been powered by his customary tee-to-green quality and in the hope that a return to this course sparks a return to his best, he looks worth backing at around the 66/1 mark. Here at Augusta, he lost a 2012 play-off to Bubba Watson and after struggling to put that behind him a year later, has since built up a solid bank of form with three top-25 finishes in four and no further missed cuts.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Daniel Berger makes his belated debut at Firestone having withdrawn on the eve of the tournament twelve months ago and on paper it is a course that should suit him. At Firestone you need to drive it long and relatively straight, which is fine for Berger who ranks 37th for strokes gained off the tee. He also arrives on a run of form that reads 1-MC-2-5-27.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old. Also like: Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
Spieth,  ->  positive

It’s all been his approach game. After losing (a lot) of strokes to the field on approach shots every event from February through April (3 MCs – And one DJ – and no finish better than T38 in six starts) Reed has it going the other way his last two times out. He gained 3.8 strokes on the Wells Fargo field with his irons, good for a T12, and another 4.8 at THE PLAYERS en route to a T22.
Reed  ->  positive

He was 9th for Putting Average at TPC Sawgrass and played beautifully in windy, technical conditions for much of the tournament.

His combination of power, iron play, and poise should serve him very well regardless of the conditions, and you simply cannot beat the price tag this week. Bill Haas ($7,200) – Lost in the fray of big name, sexy picks will be boring Billy who could be the most patient golfer on the entire course this week. Regardless of the conditions – and he’s played every year since 2010 – Haas has carded nothing worse than a T42, and nothing worse than a T24 in the past four years.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

1pt each-way Chez Reavie at 66/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) Well rested since, this is a great opportunity for Reavie to gain his second tour win. His last four tournaments have produced finishes of 48-4-16-43 and he was in the top-10 going into the final round of the Travelers.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

1st for Greens in Regulation, 3rd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green and 6th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green at Kapalua carried on Brian's ball-striking prowess from the autumn. Tie that in with the fact that Harman has found the greens here to his liking on recent visits placing 3rd for Strokes Gained Putting last year and within the top 10 in 2016 and you can see that he has a real chance this week to deliver a much merited win. It's worth remembering that the St Simons Island resident won his maiden title with a -22/262 total at the 2014 John Deere Classic so low scoring is no chore and on a track where Greens in Regulation and Bogey Avoidance is critical, he currently sits 4th and 10th across both PGA Tour skill sets.
Brian's  ->  positive

Stud Picks  Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Spieth gets the nod over Dustin Johnson this week for me. Both have won on Poa grass this year but Spieth seems the better fit for a new course with apparently very tricky greens and a layout where power off the tee might not matter much. For all Spieth has done he’s actually never won a WGC event so the motivation to get that in his trophy case is there as well, as is the desire to catch DJ in the OWGR.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Golfers in this price range with LT metrics comparable to Castro’s have historically generated a +3.42 Plus/Minus on DraftKings with 56.8 percent Consistency. #SeaIslandMafia underboss Zach Johnson is 18th in the field with a 66.9 percent LT DA. Johnson’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score is third, his 14.1 Adj Bird Avg ranks sixth, and his 28.6 LT Putts Per Round — a large part of Kisner’s win last year — is fifth.
Johnson  ->  positive

DJ is #1 in the world in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, and that formula should give him a decent shot at a position somewhere near the top of this leaderboard. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – A missed cut at the Genesis Open may keep some away and make Matsuyama under-owned. Just a couple of days past his 25th birthday, he still has his best golf in front of him, impressive for someone with two wins already this season.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Catch him while he’s on the rise. Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside.
Keegan  ->  positive

Outside of his putting and around the green play, Day hasn’t been great lately and has now lost strokes to the field on approaches in six of his last eight rounds. Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts.
Day  ->  positive

Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Looks like a good time to jump back on. Dustin Johnson – $11,400  Similar to the Justin Thomas situation, DJ was going through the motions at the BMW Championship, taking a semi week off, looking ahead to East Lake. DJ is another golfer who can win the FedEx Cup with win this week.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

That's where we come back to missing in the right place, because if you do scrambling is fairly easy. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that Adam Hadwin looks to have an outstanding chance at around the 40/1 mark. The Canadian hasn't putted particularly well this year, but otherwise his game is an ideal fit for Harbour Town as while he struggles a little off the tee due to a lack of power, he's deadly with his approach shots and rates one of the best scramblers on the circuit.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Brian Harman ($11,500) may be the hottest golfer on the planet right now: He’s finished no worse than fourth in his two tournaments in 2018 and he hasn’t finished outside of the top 10 in his last five tournaments. Harman is also Hump’s pick to win, which means he’ll likely shoot an 85 on Thursday and withdraw from the tournament. Harman is tied for 10th with his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score, while his 67.6 Recent Adj Rd Score and 79.2 Recent GIR percentage both lead the field among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks.
Harman  ->  positive

He comes to the fore on mid-score (-11 to -17) level tournaments and at 7th in the Team USA Ryder Cup standings, a win this week would pretty much lock his place on the flight to Paris in September - which on form over the last 10 months you have to say he merits. RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

As with DJ, the encouragement for that comes from looking at this year's Bogey Avoidance stats where Fowler is ranked 4th (he makes one on just over 10% of his holes). Other very Augusta-friendly Strokes Gained stats from Fowler are 9th in Putting, 4th Tee-To-Green, 24th Driving Distance, 3rd Approach-The-Green, 1st Scoring Average, 1st Sand Save Percentage (nearly 80%) and 3rd Scrambling. If he can bring all those parts of his game to Augusta, he must have a golden chance of landing his first major.
Fowler  ->  positive

With two spots remaining, we have $18,300 left to work with. Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

He played well throughout the week but shot a disappointing 80 in round two but bounced back with a 64, 66 over the weekend to post nine under in total. Scott then played in his native Australian Open finishing T14 for the tournament on six under which included a second round 65. He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005.
Scott  ->  positive

Indeed, in terms of world ranking points, 10 of his best 20 finishes have come either a week before, a week after or during the week of a major championship, so the timing of the Travelers is ideal for him. Cauley has looked on the verge of an overdue breakthrough for some time now and a ball-striker's golf course like this one, with so many of the big names vulnerable, represents a serious opportunity. Posted at 1215 BST on 20/06/17.

A second win at Waialae came in January - a course which links well through to Bay Hill champions Ernie Els, Matt Every and Marc Leishman. Then on his last outing, at WGC-level in Mexico, Kizzire finished with a -5/66 to jump into 12th spot and again grab a decent haul of OWGR + FedEx Cup points. Now into March, he still ranks 2nd in the FedEx Cup points standings, 51st in the OWGR and 12th in the Ryder Cup standings for Team America.

Splitting the top ten or so in terms of winning, or at least contending, is too tough for me and whilst my own preference is for Bubba Watson to prove just too inventive for the rest, it is impossible to deny the claims of those around him in the market.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

He is a bomber who putts well and although he can be a little wild, we get a huge break in pricing versus his odds to win the event allowing us to use him early this week. Erik Dantoft: Brandon Hagy ($8,300) (FanDuel, rounds 1 and 2)  Hagy is an ideal round 1-2 golfer this week on FanDuel. His inexpensive salary allows you to spend up for a top tier round 3-4 golfer, but more importantly, Hagy is in a great position to score you some early round 1-2 fantasy points with the likelihood of adding some finishing points at the end of the tournament as well.

Chappell confesses to feeling comfortable at Bay Hill, where his relentless ball-striking and love for a demanding test is rewarded, and he did very little wrong here when second to Day in 2016, leading the field in strokes-gained tee-to-green as we've come to expect. Video element not supported Kevin Chappell makes an ace at the API  Throw in finishes of 14th and 24th, the latter on debut six years ago, plus second in the PLAYERS, second at Jack's place in the Memorial and second to McIlroy in the TOUR Championship, and it's clear that there's a lot in favour of a player who tends to produce his best golf against the very best. Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Thomas, incidentally, won last year having finished 21st in 2016 so you only have to go back 12 months to find an example to help Leishman's cause. Final Bet: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 25/1  You'll find former Kapaula winners Spieth, DJ and Reed high up the 2017 Scrambling stats (Fowler was eighth) and looking at the same list helps lead us towards Kevin Kisner.

His personal best was a T13 in 2014. Roberto Castro … While he's been optimistic to point out that his form can be directly proportional to the time of year – that is, when it heats up nationwide, so does he – and while that's precisely what's occurred a couple of times since he splashed onto the PGA TOUR in 2012, he's still searching for a flint to spark this year's surge. As he creeps up on his 32nd birthday (on June 23), he's survived only one cut in his last nine starts.

Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state. Piller has been wildly inconsistent on the PGA Tour, despite being a six-time winner on the Web.com Tour, one of which came last year to help secure his PGA Tour card this season.

It is worth remembering Chappell’s strong showing at the FedEx Cup play-offs, finishing 2nd at the season-ending Tour Championship and 8th at the Deutsche Bank Championship, proving he has plenty of game, on the biggest of stages. John Peterson 200/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  I put Peterson up for the other event in his home state, the Shell Houston Open, just for him to withdraw before the off, but I like chances that bit more here, at the same price. Last week, Peterson turned up to the RBC Heritage off the back of some travelling issues and a weekend in Vegas, but this time the father-to-be looks to be in better focus.
John Peterson  ->  positive

Whilst the PGA players read the script in Hawaii, the less said the better about South Africa, where the impressive Chris Paisley won his maiden very easily from local and tournament fav Branden Grace. It really does feel as though events other than the select top few are open to any player these days and anyone following a group of youngsters over a cliff really shouldn’t be giving up any time soon, clearly at any price.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

He has made five of his last six cuts and although he failed to make the weekend at the Canadian Open it was his best putting display (in terms of strokes gained) since the early months of the season. Sedgefield Country Club often descends into a shootout and Kim could deliver on his promise. Bet with Sky Bet and get 6 places at 1/4 odds.
Kim  ->  positive

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 4 Winners:  2016: Justin Thomas (-23)  2015: Justin Thomas (-26)  2014: Ryan Moore (-17)  2013: Ryan Moore (-14)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Par 4 Scoring Fairways Hit GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Justin Thomas ($12,300)  Who else to begin with the two-time defending Champion, Justin Thomas? JT is now the 4th ranked golfer in the world, and it’s largely in part to his terrific summer where he enjoyed a pair of wins at the PGA Championship and Dell Technologies Championship, before a 2nd place finish at the TOUR Championship to earn him the FedEx Cup Title.
JT  ->  positive

But I also like McGirt as his 69-68 across the weekend in Las Vegas was good enough for tied 5th in the field - level with Cantlay and Hadley - plus his CV contains plenty of excellent performances by the coast. A steady hand on the tiller might be just what's needed this week on the eastern seaboard and McGirt fits that bill perfectly. RESULT: T8  Beau Hossler 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
McGirt  ->  positive

Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox! He has form a plenty on Pete Dye courses and I’m not at all surprised to see him now adding this event back on to his schedule after missing it the last two years.
Knox  ->  positive

If he keeps up the same pace of improvement here, the Green Jacket is his and regardless of whether that looks likely or not, there is no denying his suitability with the course. Henley was defending his title at the Houston Open last week and whilst he was quiet on Friday and Saturday, Henley played well on Thursday (69) and Sunday (65) to finish a respectable T8, perfect preparation once again for this week. He will need to improve in keeping bogeys off his card, never ranking higher than 16th in that department in the three starts he’s made the weekend, but now making his fifth start at Augusta, he should have a better understanding of how to do just that.
Henley  ->  positive

18+, T&Cs apply:  I'm always preaching patience so let's stick with Jhonattan Vegas for a further week on a course where he has a habit of playing well. As I noted last week, Vegas has certainly turned a corner of late and that's best highlighted by the fact that he only conceded 4 bogeys at PGA West last week, beaten only by Andrew Landry. That will stand him in very good stead this week on a course where the talented Venezuelan has finished 3rd (2011 on debut), 11th (2015), 18th (2016) and 28th (2017).
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

Although past course history should not be entirely ignored Perez really has shown he is a new player now. Gary Woodland – Cash Games – DK: $9400 FD: $9000  Woodland looked good last week finishing T18 and has shown solid form lately with six straight made cuts. Finishing 2nd here last season Woodland is sure to draw high ownership on both DraftKings and FanDuel given his salary.
Woodland  ->  positive

In terms of correlating course form, Simpson has results everywhere you want to see them and it's also good to see that he has excellent Champion Bermudagrass results across both TPC Southwind (3rd 2014) and Sedgefield Country Club (5th 2014, 6th 2015, 3rd 2017). RESULT: T21  Tony Finau 1.5pts EW 45/1 with £/€20 risk-free bet* for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (8 EW, 1/5 odds):  Big names at the top of the betting have created bigger prices for some form players and I like the look of Tony Finau this week. On a course where length, power and a strong scrambling game are required, Finau looks a good shout this week, especially as the birdies are flowing of late.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo – $9,000  He is becoming a staple near the top of the leaderboard, but I do not see myself owning Grillo this week. For one, I like so many of the other golfers around Grillo, and find myself gravitating towards them. I think he will be very popular due to his recent form.
Grillo  ->  negative

He has made five of his past six cuts, finishing as high as 10th at Pebble Peach. Fade - Zach Johnson (77K): Like Taylor, Johnson doesn't match the course at all. The key difference: Johnson costs triple the salary.
Zach Johnson  ->  negative

As you'd expect a mix of players and circumstances across 3 different courses, but all had at least a top 16 finish in one of their previous 2 outings which differs significantly from the incoming form characteristics if you look purely at the Valero Open winners. My selections are as follows:  Billy Horschel 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Billy Horschel arrives in San Antonio with momentum and we know that he likes playing in Texas.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season. Of his eight PGA events, Grillo has two top-10s, including at a very tough Honda Classic in which he finished T8. Grillo performs well on tough courses, can play in the wind and is a very strong second-shot golfer.
Grillo  ->  positive

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one.
Reed  ->  positive

He only finished behind winner, Bubba Watson and runner-up Dustin Johnson so he was bettered by two of the very best on the PGA Tour. In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory.
Harman  ->  positive

Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
Mickelson  ->  negative

Selections:  Si Woo Kim @ [70.0]  Russell Knox @ [80.0]  Brian Stuard @ [140.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter There are a number of players at huge prices that I could easily fall for but I'm going to leave it at three for now. Russell Knox found some form at a venue he likes last week and I've also chanced Brian Stuard again after his tied ninth alongside the Scotsman in Mexico but that'll do me before the off.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

That same person isn’t going to magically lead in Driving Distance if they’re not a bomber. And what does Streelman do well? He’s incredibly efficient getting to the green.
Streelman  ->  positive

Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
Johnson  ->  positive

He is second on the European Tour in GIR and he's even 18th in putting, the weakest part of his game. Tier 2 Values    Justin Rose - $9,600 (20-1)    Rose has three top-4s in four starts this year, including tournaments played at Torrey Pines and Riviera. He's a horrid 164th in driving accuracy, but still is fifth in strokes gained tee-to-green.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Much like Chez Reavie with solid recent performances I would expect Bradley to be cash chalk and feel that this is well deserved. Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times.
Reavie  ->  positive

This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day. He doesn’t have the best results at Muirfield, but it seems as though Day has found his old form.
Spieth  ->  positive

2016 Wyndham Championship top 10 picks  1. Patrick Reed -- Reed is a former winner here, doing that in 2013 for his first PGA Tour win. He had a good finish in Rio (final-round wise), and he's been a top-15 mainstay most of the summer.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

At a venue and time of year when he's very much in his comfort zone, it would be no surprise to see Snedeker sprint out of the blocks and take an early place at the top of the leaderboard. Spieth, by the way, has opened with a 66 on both his starts in this event. In 2014, it gave him the first-round lead and last year's Thursday seven-under left him second.
Spieth,  ->  positive

I think he’s a better fit for this course than his results dictate and like him to contend, if not win, this week. MY SLEEPER : Kyle Stanley ($6,000)  Stanley is off to a nice start in 2017 with four of five made cuts and three top-25 finishes or better. This has mostly been off the back of some solid ball-striking too as he currently ranks eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 14th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and is also averaging over 300 yards per drive in 2017.
Stanley  ->  positive

He’s not as long off the tee as some of the bigger names (only 295 yards on average), but he hits the fairway consistently. Sitting 7th in Ball-Striking (combination of Total Driving and GIR), Casey has been great on Approach (3rd in SG:App), although a little lacking outside 200 yards which could mean some trouble. Between 150-17 and 175-200 however, Casey is 9th and 4th respectively and overall ranks 23rd in Proximity to the Hole which has helped him find 70.68% of Greens in Regulation.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s. Martin hasn’t missed a cut since the RBC Heritage in April, including a T5 at the Quicken Loans National and racked up 21 birdies at The Barbasol Championship last week in route to a T6 finish. Just below the average price on DraftKings means Martin will be a lock for us in all formats.
Martin  ->  positive

There doesn’t appear to be a huge advantage in stacking tee times at the moment; although, if one of the first two days’ forecasts improves a bit, it might be better to have your player on the South course when the weather is better. Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top-10 performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016).
Snedeker  ->  positive

My main fancy in Mexico is a fairly speculative one on first look but yet given he won his last tournament, Joost Luiten perhaps shouldn’t be the outsider that the market makes him at 125/1*. Luiten was last seen getting the better of Ryder Cup player Chris Wood in Oman two weeks ago and unusually he putted very well. It is normally tee-to-green supremacy that we associate with Luiten and it was that part of his game that was on show at Chapultepec last year as he ranked 1st in drving accuracy and 1st in GIR.
Luiten  ->  positive

Bill Haas at 40/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - consistent type is better equipped than most to deal with course switch  0.5pt e.w. Patrick Rodgers at 200/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - T2 in the 2015 renewal and worth chancing to bounce back to form  0.5pt e.w. Smylie Kaufman at 500/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - speculative but better on last solo start and may surprise  1pt e.w.
Patrick Rodgers  ->  positive

East Lake is always a test where tee-to-green prowess prevails and with potentially soft conditions in play for a segment of the tournament, I will happily take Rose who's certainly on a roll. RESULT: T10  Webb Simpson 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 using code SPORTS60 , T&Cs apply (4 places, 1/4 odds):  I will finish the 2016/17 PGA Tour season with Webb Simpson. Always the sort who's a true "horse for the course", it's noticeable that the Tour Championship is often contended for by players ranked in the mid-teens when it comes to FEC standing.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

After a good start to the season and a solid performance last year, Snedeker looks a good shout here. Pat Perez 45/1  The American is playing great golf at present with a win and two top 10’s in his last four starts. He started the season with a respectable T33 at The CIMB Classic and followed that with an impressive T7 at The Shriners Open in Vegas where he shot rounds of 66,66,69,68 to finish 15 under par in total.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. This week’s OWGR chart has some very interesting standouts this week, one of whom is Wesley Bryan who’s official world golf ranking is 40th in the world despite his sub $7k price tag. Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place.
Wesley Bryan  ->  positive

Cantlay  ->  positive

Early in the season, I like to go with a player who has started hot. Kevin Kisner had a great weekend at the Sony Open and when he gets hot, he can go low. This week the winner will need to go low.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Slight preference is for Leishman as the Aussie has a T4 here from 2013 while Hadwin is a first-timer. Bill Haas is another at a big-looking 100/1 while, at 110s, I've always felt Ryan Moore has a big Masters in him at some point. At opposite ends of the age scale, it wouldn't surprise me at all if three-time winner Phil Mickelson and Spanish sensation Jon Rahm are part of a Sunday showdown.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls. People are moving off of Reed at a point in the season he is playing his best golf. Four of his last five events have resulted in a T20 or better finish.
Reed  ->  positive

The UK and Ireland challenge is both historically and recently strong so I thought I'd look at the various nationality markets, starting with the Top English. The Olympic Champion and 2013 US Open winner, Justin Rose, is the strong and rightful favourite to finish the week as the Top English player at Erin Hills and after his incredibly sporting reaction to his defeat at the US Masters in a playoff to Sergio Garcia, few would begrudge the understated and charming 36-year-old. Rose knows what's required - plenty of patience and a calm demeanour - and he should love the course.
Justin Rose,  ->  positive

Count on him to tear it up here even at this price with plenty of shots at those nice FantasyDraft birdie streak bonuses. Hudson Swafford ($15,300, Cash or GPP) – The Swafficer has been one of my absolute favorites over the past year. Why?
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

At this price point, Kisner makes for a quality core play. Also Consider: Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, J.B. Holmes  Dark Horse:  Lucas Glover ($8,600) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact.
Glover  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  3. Pat Perez  MY PICK : Rickie Fowler ($10,700)  Fowler hasn’t played poorly in the first two events of the postseason, it’s just seemed that way because he’s been badly outshone by a couple of his peers. The truth is, Fowler has actually had one of the most consistent seasons of his career, statistically speaking, but he’s just had only one win to show for it.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.
Reed  ->  positive

Ancer should be comfortable with the culture and language spoke on the property this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

USA TODAY Sports  Here are some golfers to consider for this weeks card. Jason Dufner - Jason Dufner has three straight top-25 finishes and enters this week ranked 14th in driving accuracy percentage and sand save percentage. Dufner is hitting a good ball right now and enters an event where he’s finished top-30 in each of his last eight appearances.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68. As only the ninth most expensive player in the field this week I think Chappell represents good/great DraftKings value and like an NBA player banking in his 3-pointer at the buzzer I am even calling for him to pick up his first PGA Tour victory here, too. MY SLEEPER : John Peterson ($6,900)  John Peterson has proven himself to an interesting character in his few years out on tour.
Chappell  ->  positive

Jonathan Randolph ($6900) – A better putter than his SG: Putting rank of 100 would suggest, Randolph is very good at one-putting (40.9%) and is nails from 4-8’ (7 th in 148 attempts) which isn’t listed as a “key” stat, but is encompassed in the 5-10’ putting range that has some importance. Randolph is great from short distances and like Vaughn is known for his accuracy. He missed the cut in 2015 (only attempt) but has shown better form in making seven of his last ten events, including a T8.
Randolph  ->  positive

Selections  Brian Harman 16/1 (UniBet & 888 – 6 places 1/5 odds) 2 pts e/w:  He may be the second favourite in the field, and it may not be the most original pick but Harman looks almost impossible to leave out this week. Twelve months ago Harman finished 3rd here, a year after finishing 11th, so it is clear he has found a liking for this event. Adding to his recent event form, Harman also finished 8th at Q-School when it was hosted here in 2011 so it is fair to say he has an affinity with the setup here.
Harman  ->  positive

Spieth is certainly in that camp and despite all of the top 6 in the FedEx Cup standings having legitimate chances in Georgia this week, I think the World Number 2 has all of the tools he needs at his disposal to capture the FEC title for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. When asked in Chicago what he likes about East Lake, Spieth replied: "East Lake and Augusta remind me a lot of each other. You have a really well designed golf course where the fairways slope against the ball flight that you need off the tee and then the greens remind me of each other with the slope, the speed and the bunkering around them.
Spieth  ->  positive

Load up and don’t look back. Paul Casey ($9,900) – Casey is coming into the Wells Fargo Championship in great form. He has played excellent golf lately and it should continue this week.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

I mean, it doesn’t hurt. But most of it has to do with Hadwin’s elite iron play the past six weeks. Hadwin is averaging 5.3 strokes gained on his approaches over his last three starts, good for finishes of T6, T9 and T12.
Hadwin’s  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson 28/1 (General) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson has not won since the 2013 Open Championship and that is an obvious concern, but where better to get back on track than TPC Scottsdale. Mickelson is a three-time winner here and has shot the course record (60) twice, so it is clear he loves the place. Unlike Torrey Pines (where he had struggled in recent years), Mickelson has still kept up his form here.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price.
Leishman  ->  positive

I want DJ as my anchor. DraftKings Picks:    Dustin Johnson ($11,900): He's the defending champ here and playing well early in the year. Branden Grace ($7,700): Had a pair of podium finishes in alittude over the last four months.
DJ  ->  positive

He makes great salary relief for DJ, and could find himself with a top-25 this week. John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards).
DJ,  ->  positive

Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Brooks Koepka  He came agonizingly close to winning last year, eventually losing to Sergio Garcia in a playoff, but Koepka returns to a favored track with form in his favor. He's finished 16th or better in each of his last four starts, which means this week should be the perfect marriage of course experience and recent performance.
Koepka  ->  positive

More realistic are the claims of Luke List, Jason Kokrak and Jamie Lovemark, three big-hitting maidens who have all looked like winners-in-waiting for some time, and all have something to recommend them here. However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

There were some indications of possible functional impairments (Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed) continuing to rear their ugly heads, but otherwise, there’s a distinct possibility that some of these guys just played uber aggressively knowing that they wanted to get to Augusta early to start their preparation. Obviously, I have no concrete evidence to support that, but a Jordan Spieth 77 on a course that easy, for instance, is an utterly bizarre happening. Let’s review some key player performances:  Russell Henley: Henley was my “hold my nuts and hope” fade this week, and apparently it was rightfully so.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He has also played well at the US Open in the past finishing T10 in Merion in 2013 and a T2 in Pinehurst in 2014. Fowler also ticks a lot of statistical boxes here ranking 33rd in driving distance, 25th in driving accuracy, 29th in GIR, seventh in strokes gained putting and 22nd in scrambling. When you weigh it all up its hard not to fancy Rickie’s chances here in Erin Hills.
Fowler  ->  positive

Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri. Wont see high ownership but there are much better pivots on the board.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  negative

Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
Laird’s  ->  positive

Basically, I'm looking for a big hitter with a win this year who is coming in off a top 20 at Firestone. Step forward Kevin Chappell. The 31-year-old scored his maiden victory in April's Valero Texas Open and has since posted T4 at St. Jude, T8 in Canada two weeks ago and T13 in the WGC-Bridgestone where he carded 67-68-69 over the final three rounds.
Kevin Chappell.  ->  positive

Most of my lineups will have Casey on them. Adam Scott ($8,800) – Seriously, why is Adam Scott priced in the 8k range whenever there is a strong field. Scott has 3 top 15’s in his last 4 tries here to go with a win back in 2011.
Scott  ->  positive

Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
Johnson  ->  positive

According to his PGA TOUR profile, he also resides in Scottsdale. Ranking the Field I've been slow to jump on the Harkins train since his Web.com Tour results weren't anything to drool over. However, it's impossible to keep ignoring his torrid form.
Harkins  ->  positive

A fantastic long game has always been the Japanese sensation's biggest asset - 302 yards off the tee and Total Driving ranks of 21st in 2016 and 13th for the season-to-date doesn't tell a lie - however when Hideki is most dangerous is when the flat stick is cooperating too and he's in the middle of a purple patch in that respect right now which should spell danger to the rest of the field. 3rd for putting average at Erin Hills (1.63 putts per GIR), 15th at Portstewart (1.68) and 2nd at Birkdale (1.67) is the best prolonged spell we've seen from Matsuyama since he won an incredible 5 events in 9 global starts either side of Christmas. With confidence clearly growing once again with the putter it will only take a decent ball-striking week on a course which suits like Firestone for him to be knocking on the door once again.
Hideki  ->  positive

There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event. Even so, an $8,900 salary on FanDuel this week has a significant amount of value in it if Woods makes the cut and shows very capable top-25 upside. He won the event in 2013, but Woods is clearly a different golfer now in 2018.
Woods  ->  positive

Outright Bets to Win  Brian Harman 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  JJ Spaun 65/1  First Round Leader  Jon Rahm 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chez Reavie 50/1  Brian Stuard 75/1  Sam Saunders 120/1  Doubles  Jon Rahm 8/1  Brian Harman 15/1  Kevin Kisner 20/1  Patton Kizzire 30/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  Euro  Dustin Johnson 5/1  Rory Mcilroy 7/1  Justin Rose 8/1  Branden Grace 22/1  Tommy Fleetwood 40/1 We'll touch on those at the end. We'll just get right to it with the first tip, the La Quinta Course is the Easiest of the 3 so we should target guys that tee off early on this course first on Thurs for the First Round Leader bets.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
Bubba Watson,  ->  positive

The left-hander was a big eye-catcher in Boston, where the long game and the short game worked in harmony for sixth place - his best strokeplay finish since last year's second place at the Open Championship. Mickelson spoke afterwards of some real off-course struggles this year, including severe fatigue, but says he's on the right track now and relieved to finally get rewarded for his hard work. Statistically, Mickelson was really close to his absolute best last time and despite a stop-start season, he yet again ranks inside the PGA Tour's top 20 in birdie average.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Jack Nicklaus landed the inaugural edition in 1974, former World No.1s Greg Norman, Nick Price, David Duval, Kaymer and Jason Day have all triumphed as have countless other major winners. Rory can still get frustrated here but with a few doubts over some of his main rivals - DJ's poor record, Day's modest form, Spieth's two missed cuts here in 2015 and 2016 - the path could be clear for four-time major winner McIlroy to get his hands on the trophy. Fourth at Bay Hill on his last start in Florida and T7 at Augusta National, he should be fresh as a daisy after his layoff earlier in the year.
McIlroy  ->  positive

In 2015, Casey gained a massive 10 strokes to the field with the strength of his approach game, and that’s a repeatable skill that should help him this week. Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens. Unlike Spieth, Casey has actually found some success off the tee – albeit not to the point where he’s a top-10 player, but he’s been consistent enough not to lose strokes in that area.
Casey  ->  positive

Given the length of the course it is good to have a bigger hitter on board and Finau fits that bill, ranking 6th in Driving Distance on the PGA Tour. Anything in the three-figure mark about a player with Finau’s upside is worth a second look and I think he can go well here, especially if he finally gets the putter rolling. Even when finishing 5th in Canada last time out, Finau only ranked 55th in Strokes Gained: Putting, losing strokes on the field (-.405) and unfortunately this is definitely his Achilles Heel.
Finau  ->  positive

Should his putting revert to anything like normal this week, there’s a good chance Palmer has a good week at a course and event he clearly enjoys. Since 2006, Palmer has finished inside the top-10 on five occasions, including a 2nd in 2014 and a 4th in 2011. Palmer has also only missed the cut twice in that span, so he generally sticks around for the whole week here.
Palmer  ->  positive

Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

MY PICK : Russell Henley ($8,300)  There are a lot of interesting plays at the top this week in a stronger than expected field, but for DFS my main pick is going to be more of a value play. Russell Henley has played outstanding golf almost all season, with an early season equipment change doing wonders for his approach game specifically. Henley has always been good off the tee and on the greens, but his new found efficiency is pushing him towards the top of the tour in many other stats as well.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

If he can keep the pieces together and continue to play big boy golf on the big stages, he’s one of the best ball-strikers in the game. Adam Scott: It was a rather lethargic performance for Adam Scott, although he posted one of the better Sunday rounds to get himself up to a T14 finish despite a poor 71 on Saturday. The putter was a mess, and he most definitely did not pay off the gigantic price we were required to fork over for him.
Adam Scott:  ->  positive

He’s a great value this week. Wesley Bryan ($7,500) – Bryan’s exceptional performances recently at both Riviera and PGA National warrant some reasonable attention this week as he will be on a course where his particular skill set should very much come in handy regardless of his lack of length. If his tee-to-green game is on point, Bryan is dangerous around and on the greens, and he could be an excellent value pick this week.
Bryan  ->  positive

Indeed, he's no bigger for any of the four majors, yet here he does not have to beat the very best and nor does he have to prove that the course fits, because in six visits he's made five cuts, twice contending for the title, while even last year's 12th place included a third-round 65. Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson.
Fowler  ->  positive

Wesley Bryan at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  1pt e.w. Maverick McNealy at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Rookies, non-winners, the never-hads and probably-never-will-bes should all be on high alert this week at the John Deere Classic. When not being carved up by Steve Stricker or Zach Johnson, TPC Deere Run has proven a profitable venue for players to break their duck on the PGA Tour and a lack of real depth at the top of the betting could well open the door once again for a maiden success.
McNealy  ->  positive

Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
Rose  ->  positive

Last 50 starts? Casey has made the top 10 in 40% of them. Filter it down to top sevens (the number of payout places on offer) and it's 26%.
Casey  ->  positive

He has a great course history (runner-up last weekend, his third showing of T20 or better). His game is perfectly suited to putting up huge fantasy numbers (his 13 birdies last weekend for his T49 finish was only one birdie back of Adam Scott, who finished 38 spots higher on the leaderboard). He’s been inside the top 20 five times in his last six starts, the kind of consistency you like to see before you trust him in a cash game, which means he is now a viable candidate in any format contest.
Adam Scott,  ->  positive

Russell Knox ($7,800) might not be all that intriguing with the names surrounding him, but he is well suited for Harbour Town. Knox has shown that he can play here as he has made the cut in all four of his attempts here with two Top-10s and no finishes outside of the Top-20. It feels as though everyone has completely forgotten about Knox, but this course history cannot be ignored.
Knox  ->  positive

7th (2013) and 1st at East Lake (2014) across an elite-class field also shows that Horschel likes the rigours of a Donald Ross test. Success here at Sedgefield had been limited with a 30th, 46th, 47th and a MC from 4 appearances until 12 months ago when Horschel off of the back of some indifferent non-Bermuda form, very reminiscent to what we are seeing from him at the moment, finished 5th. Naturally with a Floridian upbringing, this Bermudagrass narrative makes plenty of sense and in this season alone, Horschel has finished 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and 4th at TPC Southwind, with Bermudagrass making up 3 of his 4 top 5 finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

Noren ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 48th in GIR, 16th in SGTTG, 17th in strokes gained putting, 26th in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. After a missed cut on his only appearance here last year, Noren arrives in much better form this time around. Kiradech Aphibarnrat 100/1  The in form Thai looks great value here this week given his current run of form.
Noren  ->  positive

Perez’s 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score is 16th, and his 14.2 LT Adj Bird Avg is tenth overall. Charley Hoffman: Hoffman has had some mixed results at Colonial, but he has three top-20 finishes — including a top-10 performance — and zero missed cuts in his last six appearances. He is tied for 23rd with his 69.5 LT Adj Rd Score.
Hoffman:  ->  positive

He’s also playing pretty well with two top 5’s in his last 4 starts. Rose loves playing here at Bay Hill. This will be his 11 appearance overall, and in his previous 10 starts 5 top 10’s.
Rose  ->  positive

When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend.
Fowler  ->  positive

Like Hoffman, Steven Bowditch, Martin Laird, Brendan Steele and Adam Scott are all capable of getting it out there off the tee, making the 2012 victory of Ben Curtis all the more hard to fathom and, for form study purposes, worth treating with caution. All of this serves to whittle down those at the head of the market, where Matt Kuchar is easy to oppose after a staying-on but never-threatening 11th on arguably more suitable terrain last week, and clear preference is for Brooks Koepka at anything around the 25/1 mark. Having signed off 2016 in the form of his life, which included an impressive Ryder Cup debut, it’s been a difficult start to 2017 for Koepka, one of the many Nike-branded players who now have licence to experiment with their equipment.
Brooks Koepka  ->  positive

Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B.

The other four either hadn’t played for at least three weeks or finished outside the top 30 the week prior.
2016—Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Who the Stats Like  Keegan Bradley  World Golf Ranking (#70)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,600)  FanDuel ($9,600)    For my first stats pick this week I wanted to not only find a player who stands out on my sheet(mix of this year and last year stats ranks) but also a player who has been trending recently. Enter Keegan Bradley who is #11 in my stats model as he ranks 2nd overall in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking(7th in OTT, 5th in APP), 16th in Good Drive %, 16th in Proximity, and 15th in Par 4 Scoring. His only knock with my key stats are Par 5 Scoring and Birdie or Better %(can be attributed to his brutal putting).
Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

He’s coming off a missed cut at the BMW PGA across the pond, but finished 2nd in China, 2nd in the WGC Mexico, and 1st back in January in Abu Dhabi; all of these events had strong fields, and his top-10 finish at the Arnold Palmer has shown he can compete in tough fields stateside as well. Phil Mickelson ($7700): On a course where scrambling and second shots matter, Phil is priced far too cheaply for his upside; it’s a given that he’ll end up in some odd spots off the tee from week to week, but Lefty is consistently one of the best around the greens (currently 25th in SG: ARG) and has been throughout his career. Mickelson has struggled to get through four full rounds this year, whether it’s from mental lapses or physical exhaustion (he’s old), so that will be a concern – but he’s also 24th in Approach shots, an elite putter who puts up a ton of DK points with his great birdie average, and he’s 10th in scoring on Par-5s.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

At 100/1 I really like Berger’s chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard, as he looks to add a second PGA Tour title in as many years. Branden Grace 100/1 (SkyBet 1/4 7 Places) 0.5pt e/w:  The South African is one of those players that you would have expected to have a much better record here at TPC Sawgrass, especially given his record on Pete Dye Courses. Grace has a great record at Harbour Town with a win, a 7th and an 11th place finish to his name there, and also finished 3rd at the 2015 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

The course record at the South Course still remains 62 which was shot by Woods in 1999. The record at the old North Course was 61, shot by both Mark Brooks (1990) and Snedeker (2007). If the North Course, as expected plays slightly tougher, the 61 may remain intact, whilst the 62 from Tiger on the South Course has already stood the test of time.
Snedeker  ->  positive

After a solid performance in Sedgefield last week Sneds is certainly worth a second look here. Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend.
Grace  ->  positive

English has recovered from his midseason missed cut stretch with 4/5 straight made cuts. Looking at his Vegas odds English stands out in his price range and I think he does without a crazy high level of ownership. Much like Finau the weakest part of his game is minimized at this course.
English  ->  positive

ALEX CEJKA – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 NON RUNNER - WITHDREW BEFORE START  In a second division event played on Papsalum greens Cejka always has to come in to the conversation. A proven winner on the European Tour Cejka decided to relocate and take up life on the PGA Tour in the early 2000s and after many years of toil he was finally rewarded with a victory at the Puerto Rico Open in 2015. This victory of course makes Cejka of interest in this event due to the obvious course correlations previously noted.
ALEX CEJKA  ->  positive

Last year it averaged 4.31. Market Leaders  Justin Rose has been knocking at the door of late, with a fifth-place finish at the Valspar Championship and a third in the Arnold Palmer, but his form here is only ordinary, reading 52-14-37-15 and I suspect his participation is based on how good a prep the event has been for him for the US Masters. He didn't play here in 2016 when he finished only 10th at Augusta but after his 37th in 2015 and his 15th last year, he went on to finish second in the Masters.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Wow. Even with a nasty backslide on Sunday, Rahm still did what Rahm does best and birdied his way back to even par on the day. He’s just a sensational talent and an excellent candidate to find his first win this season.
Rahm  ->  positive

Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back. Jones played in his first event of 2017 last week in Phoenix, saving his best round until last. A final-round 66 saw Jones climb the leaderboard, finishing T36.
Jones  ->  positive

This time he has been much more consistent, finishing T14 at Torrey before his T16 last week, so I am full of confidence once again, that Mickelson can get his first win since the 2013 Open Championship. Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here.
Reed  ->  positive

Lovemark hasn’t had the best of seasons but he doesn’t look far away, and playing alongside a partner who can get up and down from anywhere and is so easy to get along with should guarantee that he’s fully focused for this return to the scene of his standout PGA Tour performance. Seung-hul Noh impressed when winning the Zurich Classic three years ago and is interesting alongside An, who was second on his sole visit, beaten in the same play-off as Lovemark. You can rest assured An in particular will be fired up given his recent war-of-words with two less-able American players concerning the world rankings, but Noh will take some carrying on recent form and that’s enough to put me off.
Lovemark.  ->  positive

This will be the third stroke-play event in a row I have gone for “Alligator Billy”, so I hope he repays the faith this week. Another player that fits the same mould as Horschel is Russell Henley, who is also somewhat of a course specialist. Henley has finished 5-4-7 here on his last three starts and ranks 13th in Par-4 Efficiency 450-500 yards and 20th in Greens in Regulation.
Billy”,  ->  positive

Given his ranking of 16th in Strokes Gained: Putting in the early going this year, he’s a good bet to be in the mix Sunday afternoon. Russell Henley, $9,800 – Henley out-birdied Tim Clark for his first PGA Tour win at Waialae back in 2013, and since has notched a couple more top-17s, proving his win wasn’t a fluke. Henley is a strong fit for this venue given his strong balance of distance and accuracy off the tee combined with solid putting.
Russell Henley,  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour. Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar.
Grillo  ->  positive

The ownership projections you see here are my initial projections and will be updated as the week goes on so be sure to follow me on twitter to find out where you can get all the most updated ownership information. While it’s still early, this week Patrick Reed looks to be a good candidate if you’re looking for low ownership. While it’s clear he isn’t playing great now, his price has continued to drop and at some point you can expect Patrick Reed to bounce back.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Staking Plan  Rickie Fowler 1pt 16/1 each way (33/1 antepost)  Jon Rahm 1pt 18/1 each way (66/1 antepost)  Tommy Fleetwood 1pt 25/1 each way (66/1 antepost)  Padraig Harrington 1pt 66/1 each way (129/1 antepost)  Alex Noren 1pt 50/1 each way  Marc Leishman 1pt 50/1 each way Leishman, who is fourth for scoring average on the PGA Tour, merits strong consideration at 50/1 each way. His last start was a tie for fifth at the Quicken Loans National and has finished no worse than 34th in his last six tournaments.
Noren  ->  positive

The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee. This play is all ownership dependent, currently, we are projecting Thomas at around 14% in GPP’s but that could all change throughout the week before we do a final update for VIP members. Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event.
Thomas  ->  positive

With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices.
Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7 Justin Rose  ->  positive

After being on 309/1 winner @SmylieKaufman10 here 2 years ago I'm backing him again at 66/1 in @ShrinersOpen. Kaufman was tied 4th on Sunday
@SmylieKaufman10  ->  positive

4. Patrick Reed, United States -- The new FedEx Cup points leader after his fifth career victory last week in The Barclays, Reed will make his fourth start in the Deutsche Bank Championship and last year's was his best. He played the middle rounds in 67-67 and finished in a tie for fourth, although he was seven strokes behind winner Rickie Fowler.
Reed,  ->  positive

However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
Hatton  ->  negative

England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years.
Ian Poulter,  ->  positive

Russell Henley ($7100) : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor.
Henley  ->  positive

The very early 80/1 in the market has rightfully been snapped up, but with the price history of this event 66/1 with HV3 is not a bad place to be this week. A European Tour winner back in December at the Australian PGA Championship, played on Bermudagrass greens at RACV Royal Pines Resort on the Gold Coast, Varner has had a slow start to 2017, but that changed at Bay Hill where the Jacksonville Beach, Florida resident contended for 54 holes - he was 8th after Round 1 and 11th after Round 3 - before understandably going backwards in the final round when paired with Paul Casey who shot 78 to Varner's 77. That final round aside, Harold only leaked 5 bogeys over the opening 54 holes and that's a green light for me as he has the power-bomber game to really compete on his debut at Coco Beach (I really wanted him to play here last year).
Varner  ->  positive

The Spaniard shot to worldwide fame at Oakland Hills in 1999 and among his other major championship near-misses came third place at Pinehurst, perhaps the most famous entry in the Donald Ross portfolio. Given that he probably putts best on bermuda greens and has shown definite improvement across the last two FedEx Cup events, Garcia is both playing well enough and suitably under-the-radar to put his experience to use at a course which is always capable of catching out the fearless aggression of youth. Since his last start here in 2014, Garcia has really stepped up a level and he's been winning in high-class company.
Garcia  ->  positive

Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well.
Henley  ->  positive

Where immediate course form is not a must to win The Players, course experience is still an advantage, but one that seems to be waning just a little in recent times. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Ben Martin and David Lingmerth (a Sawgrass member) have contended and placed across the last 4 renewals and Henrik Stenson finished 3rd on course debut back in 2006. Hal Sutton (1983) and Craig Perks (2002) won here on course debut, but that was in an age when The Players was scheduled a couple of weeks before Augusta.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential. He’s a lock.
Rahm  ->  positive

Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 2: Jimmy Walker ($9.9m); 3: Brandt Snedeker ($9.7m); 4: Jason Dufner ($7.7m); 5: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 6: Justin Thomas ($10.5m); 7: Russell Henley ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($8.5m); 9: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.7m). Predictor Positives: Jordan Spieth dominates the Predictor model this week with a virtual 500 point gap to 'course horse' Jimmy Walker.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

The latter is a better player who has won more titles both this year and all told, who knows how to close out majors, and Fowler's links preparation shouldn't see them priced next to each other. We are talking here about an exceptional player in Fowler, but an all-time great in the making in Spieth. Players like him don't come along often.
Spieth.  ->  positive

Scott has always been a player who, once confident, can perform at a high level for a prolonged period of time. Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best.
Scott  ->  positive

He also won consecutively in 2014 where he was victorious at Congressional on the PGA Tour then again a fortnight later at Royal Aberdeen on the European Tour. 2nd (Liberty National) and 6th (Plainfield) at The Barclays since 2011, an in-form Rose should give those who are shorter in the market a run for their money at the very least. RESULT: T31  Hideki Matsuyama 1.25pts EW 30/1 with  I wasn't expecting to see 30/1 about Hideki Matsuyama but I'm happy to take it.
Rose  ->  positive

Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
Horschel  ->  positive

Perhaps it simply took him a while to figure things out at TPC Boston, as he tied for 70th in 2013 and tied for 74th the following year in his first two starts on the course. For those who were playing attention, it was no real surprise that Reed claimed his fifth PGA Tour victory at Bethpage Black because he finished second in the Valero Texas Open and the Hyundai Tournament of Champions earlier this year, two of his 10 finishes in the top 10. 5.
Reed  ->  positive

I also like his tournament history, where he is riding three consecutive Top 20s with a sixth place here last year. Kokrak ranks well in several of the tools on our website, which usually means good things. At $7,700 I think he presents us value in cash games, but also will be a lower owned GPP play as well this week.
Kokrak  ->  positive

Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

He's also the defending champ at Firestone, a course that suits him. -- Bob Harig  Adam Scott  Adam has been playing this event since 2003 and hasn't missed one since that first start! The good news; Scott is coming off a reasonable showing at the Open (T-22) and last year he finished T-10 at this event.
Scott  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay  Ben Coley provides a group-by-group guide to the WGC-Match Play Championship, with three each-way bets recommended. Group 1 Dustin Johnson  Kevin Kisner  Adam Hadwin  Bernd Wiesberger The draw for the defending champion could hardly have been kinder. Of the players in Pool B, few have been struggling as badly as Kevin Kisner of late - the fact that these struggles have taken place on courses so well suited to his game is particularly disconcerting.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He certainly had higher hopes for a season that started pretty strongly. • • •  Adam Schupak  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. The player who most reminds me of Long John Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA at Crooked Stick, is my pick.
Dustin Johnson.  ->  positive

Lots of guys who show up in Houston show up at Wells Fargo and DBC leaderboards... i'm defintely putting a few $$$ on Castro at 275-1
Castro  ->  positive

He doesn’t make as many birdies as one would like for DK scoring, but on a course where there aren’t that many birdies to go around, he’s a fine play – he also checks off the Par-4 Scoring box, with an average of 3.99 (22nd). Huh also missed the cut last week, but had fine finishes at Valero (T22) and Valspar (T9). He’s had an 8th and 16th place finish here (2013 and 2014 respectively), but missed the cut last year.
Huh  ->  positive

At this price, that kind of performance would do me just fine. Vaughn Taylor ($6,300) – Expect this play to be hugely contrarian. Another player who relies on his ball striking which should suit the course.
Vaughn Taylor  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama won in Phoenix for the second year running, Jordan Spieth justified favouritism with a dominant victory at Pebble Beach and the trend could continue with another short-priced winner at Riviera. Having watched two of his rivals in the world's top five post a win, Dustin Johnson may feel it's his turn and this looks a perfect venue for the big-hitting American to join the party. DJ had a 10-footer at 18 to win this tournament two years ago.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

He made the cut in his only appearance at the Valero Texas Open. While he's struggled with his normally steady putting this year, Poulter is 10th on Tour in strokes gained: around the green. But again, it's the qualitative elements that make Poults a must play.
Poulter  ->  positive

He has a very solid Tee to Green game and likes the course. Alex Cejka ($6,700) – I have dabbled with success in taking Cejka throughout this year and last weekend was his best start of the year finishing T9. Cejka has had two appearances at the JDC making the cut in both.
Alex  ->  positive

RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices. My mind goes back to Augusta Sunday when Justin Rose was in the middle of the 13th fairway with a 2-shot lead and Sergio Garcia was taking a penalty drop.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

I also like Moore's Donald Ross record which includes his win here, 2nd at East Lake last term, 3rd at East Lake (2012) and 2nd at Aronimink behind Justin Rose in 2010. 13th last week on a course which was far too long, Moore tied Louis Oosthuizen for least bogeys (10), and was 5th for Greens in Regulation so he's ready for a title challenge. Number 1 selection in this week's Published Predictor Model.
Moore's  ->  positive

He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events. Unlike Campbell, List is a bomber: His 309.8-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) ranks seventh in this field, and he made the cut here in his only appearance (2013). List has missed four of his last five cuts, but he finished 17th at the St. Jude Classic.
List  ->  positive

Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday. Martin Kaymer – $7,300  Martin Kaymer will be the most popular player this week and he is still a staple for me in cash and GPP lineups.
Scott  ->  positive

DFS Army Pricing  Picks  Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $11600 FD: $12600  The disappointment of last week for the top end looks to be a great GPP this week as he should see suppressed ownership. Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success.
Thomas  ->  positive

In two previous starts at PGA National he has finished 17th or better. -- Zach Turcotte  Brian Gay  Between his poor course history and not being a household name, Gay is going to be off most people's radar this week. Couple those things with a missed cut at last week's Genesis Open, and you might think I'm crazy.
Gay  ->  positive

He's the odds-on favorite to win this week and I can understand why. Statistically, Fowler has looked superb this year, ranking 4th in scrambling and gaining almost a stroke per round (over the last six weeks) from the strokes gained around the green. As we highlighted above, that metric combined with a hot putter will inevitably put Fowler in the top 10, with a chance to win come Sunday.
Fowler  ->  positive

3. Kyle Stanley  Stanley was both the hero and anti-hero to so many PGA DFSers last year, choking away insanely good performances with some of the most biblically bad putting you’ll ever see out of anyone. However, if there’s one thing yours truly loves to see, it’s consistency, and Kyle Stanley was an absolute monster in that department, carding an average of 1.259 SG:T2G per round despite playing a very busy 29 event schedule.
Stanley  ->  positive

Rose’s 2017 stats aren’t quite as sharp as always but he still sits prominently in many of the key ones for this week. Rose is 25th in driving distance, 14th in GIR, 13th in strokes gained: tee to green and 10th in scoring relative to par for approaches over 200 yards. Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong.
Rose  ->  positive

I think he picks up his second PGA title this week, and biggest win of his career. MY SLEEPER : Ian Poulter ($6,600)  Poulter is an easy person to overlook this week in DFS given the quality of THE PLAYERS field, but at $6,600 he makes for the perfect likely low-owned tournament target. The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

2 years ago he also led this tournament after 54 holes at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club which is only an hour's drive up Interstate 66. A final round 77 did for him that day as Troy Merritt took the victory, but with a Presidents Cup spot his if he finishes 2017 strongly and with plenty of top-level finishes across big tournaments under his belt since then, I think Chappell makes plenty of sense this week. Result: MC  David Lingmerth 1.5pts EW 33/1 with NEW OFFER!
Chappell  ->  positive

CAVEAT: putting is so variable week to week that it’s never good to rely on that, but with such a strong game in getting to the green, even if Rickie putts poorly this week he’ll still be in contention. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Thomas Pieters ($7500): Unfortunately this won’t be a week where Pieters gets overlooked at an excellent price like at Augusta or the Open, after his excellent performance at the WGC Bridgestone (sitting in first place at the time of writing) – as an aside, Firestone CC is a decent comparable course for Quail Hollow. Pieters still gets his feature in this space for the second week in a row thanks to his excellent iron play which will be so crucial this week, and his ability to absolutely smash the ball off the tee when needed.
Pieters  ->  positive

All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event. Matt Kuchar – All Formats – DK: $7200 FD: $7500  Every Major Kuchar finds himself with a mid 7k price tag on DraftKings and every Major he seems incredibly underpriced.
Stenson  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned. Spieth has played Pebble Beach five times, finishing 22nd, 4th, 7th, 21st, and 1st a year ago.
Spieth  ->  positive

He’ll be lower than 5% owned easily in GPP’s. Player to avoid:  Dustin Johnson $12,200 – Dustin Johnson is our fade due to price, value, and recent form to an extent. DJ’s losing strokes on the field in his last 3 events and at $800 more than Kuchar…it’s the percentage play to us.
Dustin Johnson  ->  negative

His switch back to a Scotty Cameron flat stick already seems to be paying dividends. Along with the improved putting, McIlroy ranks first on tour in both P5S and BoB, with ranks of fourth in PROX and 10th in DD. He has struggled with consistency this year but the small field allows owners to pay up for his tier-topping salary.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Scott is sniffing close to another win and has a chance to become the fifth golfer to win this event twice. Brian Harman - If you’re looking for a real longshot, you can find Brian Harman with odds of +8000. Harman wasn’t great last week at the Genesis Open, but he does have five top-25 finishes in 10 events and has made the cut seven times.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have. It’s easy to eat his salary this week with the players below, so here’s how DJ fares in the crucial categories:  Bogey Avoidance – 3 rd  Birdie or Better % – 6 th  SG: Tee to Green – 1 st  Par-4 Scoring – 2nd  Johnson has also finished no worse than T12 in his last three years here, and has never missed a cut at TPC Four Seasons. Zac Blair ($6600): The second-best scrambler on Tour (and best in the field), Blair also sits in an elite group in the Bogey Avoidance category (9th).
DJ  ->  positive

He is nice play on both sites but especially on FanDuel under $8K. Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports Peter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY SportsPeter Casey-USA TODAY Sports  Nick Watney (DK - $7,900, FD - $7,000)  Watney had some spotty history here early in his career but rebounded nicely with a T13 and T27 finishes in 2012 and 2013. He returns in 2017 with some nice form having made seven straight cuts.
Watney  ->  positive

Francesco Molinari - $6,800 (80-1)    As a member of the PGA Tour this season, the Italian has 12 top-25s in 17 starts and sits an impressive second in strokes gained approach, third in tee to green. Molinari is eighth in driving accuracy, and usually you have to be a real short hitter to rank so high. But he's middle of the pack at 104th in distance off the tee.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

For the record, Kapalua on Maui features TifEagle Bermudagrass. Thomas' Florida record isn't too bad either. 10th (2015) on course debut at Copperhead, 3rd (2016) at TPC Sawgrass and 3rd (2016) here were all achieved in Justin's first 7 tournaments in the Sunshine State and before he became the winning machine he is today.
Thomas'  ->  positive

Some guys are consistent, some are not, Pieters falls into the second category and he could see suppressed ownership because of recent results. Wesley Bryan – DK: $6800 FD: $5200  He is not much of a birdie maker but Bryan is underpriced based on ability and is a sneaky course fit. In his short PGA career, Bryan has found success on short, easy golf courses.
Wesley  ->  positive

Before withdrawing from the WGC-Bridgestone, Koepka was 13th at Oakmont, second at the FedEx St. Jude at TPC Southwind, and second in the AT&T Byron Nelson. JB Holmes ($7,700) – When you think about long courses, you think about JB Holmes. Baltusrol features two 500-yard par 4s on the front nine and 17 and 18 are both par 5s measuring over 550 yards.
Holmes  ->  positive

And despite not closing out the win last week, Lingmerth has been hot lately: He is tied for third in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score. Humpnostication  Another highly-rated player in Levitan’s model, Johnson Wagner, has made five straight cuts here and has a second-place finish on his resume from 2013. Further, Wagner is fresh off a T5 finish at another Par 70 TPC course last week, where he posted 78.0 DraftKings points.
Johnson Wagner,  ->  positive

Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well. While he’s more of a GPP play, Ogilvy is a player you can target given his improved recent form (13th overall in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green at the Valero) and affinity for this event/region. He’ll likely be extremely low owned in tournaments and could be a difference maker on a difficult looking course that may not yield many low scores.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

His form reads 7,19,11,8 since last October and comes to Riviera on the back of a top 10 finish last week in Pebble Beach. Casey started the season with a T7 at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia. He started with a disappointing 77 in round one but bounced back with an impressive 63 in round two followed by a 69,65 over the weekend.
Casey  ->  positive

People will be hesitant to play Spieth, despite being the third highest priced player, because of his poor recent form and with Augusta looming right around the corner. There is no doubt Spieth needs a huge week to gain momentum for the next week to throw his name in the ring as the betting favorites alongside Tiger and Rory. This is the last week he has to make a splash, and no one would be shocked if in two weeks time, Spieth has won back-to-back events.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Although there is a chance he could come in above five percent this week, I’m calling for a surprising under five percent from Branden this week. Grace is tied for 16th in the field with his 68.5 Recent Adj Rd Score, he has five top-15 finishes in his last eight events, and he has performed well in the last two PGA Championships, producing an average of 103.75 DraftKings points. Double S  As always, the first way we can use FantasyLabs to find potentially low-owned yet talented golfers in our Models is to leverage our Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) metric.
Grace  ->  positive

The trend has been cemented by a pair of top 10s at TPC Kuala Lumpur, coincidentally in each of the first odd-numbered years it hosted. Cameron Smith … TPC Kuala Lumpur is where the Aussie laid the foundation in earnest for his future on the PGA TOUR. It was three years ago that he tied for fifth in what was his first-ever start on the circuit.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

The 34-year-old has taken his game to a new level and there aren’t many better iron players in the world. Molinari is ranked second in strokes gained with approaches to the green and is fifth for adjusting scoring average on the PGA Tour. Erin Hills is said to be a ‘second shot’ course and that plays to his strengths.
Molinari  ->  positive

It could then go the other way, a little spell in a trough before the good stuff comes back. Brian Harman had it going from April to June when winning the Wells Fargo Championship and making a big challenge at the US Open. He managed only two top 20s in nine starts after that but he's found a real purple patch over the last few months with a run of five straight top 10s.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

The 44-year-old registered ten top-25 finishes and finished the season ranked fourth in strokes gained with approaches to the tee, that is one place above Dustin Johnson! Cink’s issue has been converting his good play into a high finish, he never bettered a T10 but if he keeps knocking eventually a top-5 or more might fall his way. With a couple of top-20 finishes at Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club under his belt.
Cink’s  ->  positive

Nothing else really takes my fancy so, instead, I'm going to switch markets and back Stewart Cink for a top 10. Cink is 60/1 in the outrights but a couple of things temper expectations. First, this is his tournament debut and, second, he's not won since the 2009 Open Championship.
Cink  ->  positive

If you're betting in-running on Sunday, be very wary of the par five 14th hole, as it's far from a certain birdie hole. It had a big say in the outcome yet again 12 months ago with Mickelson, Johan Blixt and Freddie Jacobson, who finished second, third and fourth, all making bogey there. There were only seven birdies there in round four last year and it ranked as the fourth hardest hole on the course and in the 2010 renewal it caused absolute carnage.
Mickelson,  ->  positive

Other: Webb Simpson, Joel Dahmen  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Russell Henley, Bill Haas, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Si Woo Kim, Gary Woodland, Ollie Schienderjans, Nick Taylor, Joel Dahmen  Bets:  Russell Henley 40-1  Sean O’Hair 75-1 EW  Robert Garrigus 200-1 EW and top 20 at 8-1 He’s a good gpp target on DraftKings this week and is riding a hot putter ahead of this year’s tournament. Even with his inconsistency Garrigus is still ranked top 50 in both Birdie or Better and Par 4 scoring, making him look like a nice statistical fit for this course as well.
Harris English,  ->  positive

It will behoove players to stay accurate here. A:  Jason Day - He's getting hot at the right time, 2nd in FedEx rankings, Jason has 7 top ten finishes in his last 10 starts. Add to that his great record of play here: 12th (2015), 7th (2014), 13th (2013).
Jason  ->  positive

Hadwin recently got married, but he's put off the honeymoon to keep his momentum going by riding a hot putter that has him eighth in strokes gained/putting on tour. Luke Donald: Poor, Luke. He didn't qualify for the Masters and then Sergio Garcia abandoned their game of Worlds With Friends over the weekend.
Luke  ->  positive

With both golfers projected to be in the Top 5 of ownership, I won't have a whole lot of exposure this week as a GPP player. Top Current Form Targets  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (12/1)  Draftkings ($11,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    Since turning pro after the US Open last year, Rahm has vaulted up the world rankings all the way from 551st to 13th. Wow!
Rahm  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($7200): For whatever reason, Kyle Stanley has been consistently under-priced on DraftKings event after event – all he’s done this season is average 68.25DK points, make 10 of 12 cuts, and finish in the top-25 six times (50%). He’s coming off a T8 at the Shell Houston Open where he hit 79.17% of his greens, which is an example of just one reason to use Stanley this week, his GIR%. Stanley is 5th on Tour in that category which goes along with his 12th ranking in SG: Approach, 6th in SG: Tee to Green, and 7th in Proximity to the Hole.
Stanley  ->  positive

Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
Hughes  ->  positive

Play him with absolute confidence. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Kyle Stanley ($6700) : Stanley finally picked up his first win in years at the Quicken Loans National, and he managed to pull it off while losing strokes to the field with his putter. That speaks to just how talented a golfer he is getting from tee to green, and at an incredible value of only $6700, Stanley is almost a must-play.
Stanley  ->  positive

Si Woo Kim showed showed some life at the Valero with a T22. If he's healthy, he and Kang could be a formidable duo at 70/1 in the Zurich.
Si Woo Kim  ->  positive

Russell Henley ($8200): 16th in Bogey Avoidance is a good place to start for the Georgia native, who’s been having an excellent year on Tour – 1st at the Shell Houston Open, and top-10s at Valspar and the RSM – and should easily continue that here. Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour.
Thomas,  ->  positive

That being said, Perez has been excellent this year out of the rough (40’2” to the pin, 22nd) and is great with a short iron in his hand, and like Ollie is better (relatively) outside 10’ than inside. On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG. Perez has consistently been a great play on DraftKings, because he’s one of the best in the field at putting up birdies.
Perez  ->  positive

Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

With several bookmakers paying 8 places, we can make a healthy profit from another good finish. 1pt each-way Francesco Molinari at 80/1 Sky Bet (8 places; 1/5 odds)  For my final selection i’m going with an old favourite – Paul Dunne. There is a danger I follow him off a cliff but at crazy odds a top-8 finish stills land a healthy return and that isn’t a mad proposition.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

He plays comfortably in Florida and comes off a nice T4 finish at the Honda Classic two weeks ago. Horschel leads the PGA Tour in GIR with DJ and Spieth just behind him in that category. He also finished 2nd in tee to green at Honda Classic.
Horschel  ->  positive

On the other hand, our continued faith in the Church of Rahm once again rewarded us with a rock-solid top-ten finish that gained us numerous points on the field since, as usual, the field continues to doubt him at their own peril. We also got solid finishes from Reed, Hadwin, Lowry, and Stricker to help buoy the hits our cash lines took from Kuchar, Furyk, and Webb as well as a lackluster performance by the uber-chalky Justin Rose for his price. For those reasons – and a sound strategy of building more than one hedge cash lineup – most of our subscribers managed to take down a modest cash game ROI with 5/6 lines, so I’m rather content about that.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

His full form there: 1-MC-2-10-8-1-4. After the lows of the Irish and Scottish Opens (MC in both) and slumping to 5-over at Royal Birkdale, McIlroy has turned a corner with back-to-back top fives at the Open and WGC-Bridgestone. Quite simply, he looks Europe’s standout this week and must have a huge chance of winning this tournament for a third time after lifting the hefty Wanamaker trophy in 2012 and 2014.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Don’t care. Rose has been in REALLY strong form basically all year, he’s just lacking a win. He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old.
Rose  ->  positive

I hope I can keep that going and continue to post a steady stream of top 20s. Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

In three starts at Riviera his form reads 23-4-11, so it is hard to not see him better each of those results this week and win again. Simply put, 10/1 is too big and if Spieth hadn’t of won last week, Matsuyama would have been favourite. When finishing 11th last year he had flu early on in the week, failing to practice at all on the Tuesday and was also limited to 9 holes on the Wednesday.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

There doesn’t appear to be any rain in the forecast for Memphis throughout the tournament, but temperatures are expected to heat up on Saturday and Sunday. Past Champions    2016 - Daniel Berger  2015 - Fabian Gomez  2014 - Ben Crane  2013 - Harris English  2012 - Dustin Johnson  2011 - Harrison Frazar  2010 - Lee Westwood  2009 - Brian Gay    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Brooks Koepka - $18,000  Adam Scott - $17,600  Francesco Molinari - $17,100  Phil Mickelson - $16,900    Cash-game Target (50/50s, Double-Ups): Despite earning headlines for his decision to skip next week’s U.S. Open in order to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, Mickelson is a safe deployment at the top of cash-game lineups this week. He hasn’t missed a single cut all season and has produced four consecutive quality results at this event with finishes of T2-T11-T3-T2 since 2013.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Creme de la creme  Jordan Spieth: $11,500  Here's the thought: The caddie-player pairing of Greller and Spieth > (Austin) Johnson and (Dustin) Johnson at a new track featuring an abundance of elevation-related calculations. A winner at Pebble Beach, Spieth is currently the tour leader in strokes gained: approach-the-green. DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish.
Jordan Spieth:  ->  positive

We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas. That's some turnaround, especially as he led the field in greens hit last time out, and on balance has to be considered an overreaction.
Fowler  ->  positive

When breaking down ownership and trying to come up with popularity, I love the tools over at FanShareSports as they break down every piece of information on articles and social media mentions to provide us with Tag COunts, Sentiment Ratings, Subject Tags, Salary Differential week to week and much more. Top Course History Targets  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#7)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($11,700)  FanDuel ($12,300)  Rickie missed the cut here at the Honda Classic in his first two trips in 2010 and 2011 but has been enjoying success here ever since. He struggled a bit in 2015 but rebounded with a T6 in 2016 and won the event last year and will now try to go back to back at PGA National.

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
Reed  ->  positive

With great current form so far this season and I expect him to have a decent week especially with his record here. Chesson Hadley 45/1  I like the look of the in-form Chesson Hadley on a course he has expressed his liking for in the past. Hadley has been playing well over the last couple of months with four top 5’s and a top 25 in his last eight starts.
Hadley  ->  positive

The Aussie hasn’t cracked the top-10 yet in 2017 but he has played solid in spots, especially of late, suggesting a big week may be coming soon. Ogilvy comes into North Carolina on the back of three top-30 finishes in his last four starts and he’s had success when he’s made the trek to North Carolina in the past, having made the cut in 10 out of 11 appearances at this event. Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well.
Ogilvy  ->  positive

With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years. Since the introduction of the new format, the last three winners have won all three of their group stage matches, confirming the elite level of play needed to get the job done here.
Day  ->  positive

The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

His win at the Tour Championship, where he held off Player of the Year, Justin Thomas was especially impressive and whilst this season has not yet lived up to expectations, a slight lull in form had to be expected. Just one missed cut this season suggests that, despite a struggle to reach the heights of last year, Schauffele can still grind out results without bringing his best stuff and with top-9 finishes at both the CIMB Classic (3rd) and the Genesis Open (T9) on the PGA Tour, as well as a T2 finish at the Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan, he is clearly still capable of flashing brilliance week-to-week. This event will be right up Xander’s street, with his distance off the tee a huge weapon when looking to overcome the long par 4’s and 5’s here.
Xander’s  ->  positive

75. Ryan Fox - $6,600 (250-1)    Fox is a 30-year-old New Zealander who plays on the European Tour. And lately, he's played quite well, with twin T4s at the Irish and Scottish Opens the past two weeks, and a solo sixth the week before at the French Open.
Ryan Fox  ->  positive

So, next for me is William McGirt, who gained his first PGA Tour title just over a year ago by beating a similar field and is capable of doubling up here. At 39th in greens hit, McGirt continues to strike the ball nicely and while he wasn't a factor last weekend, he showed up nicely enough for a couple of rounds on a golf course he admitted was just a little too long for him in the conditions. It may prove to be a positive that McGirt didn't contend at the US Open as he should arrive here relatively fresh and it's his ability to perform on the back of a major which he's either not played in or not contended for which really piques my interest.
McGirt,  ->  positive

Rory value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings again this week. His $/pt better than ave (line) on handy GP chart for… https://t.co/aAFKO8CfgR
Rory  ->  positive

Martin might not have the greatest course history at this event (MC-T34-MC), but he comes into this year’s edition in solid form and with the ability to put up a lot of birdies on a venue that favors iron play and putting over pure power. Martin also has played well in the desert before, too, winning the Las Vegas-based Shriners Hospital event back in 2015 at 20-under par. At under $7K this week, he brings serious upside for a low price.
Martin  ->  positive

I think a Top 25 is his floor this week and I will be using him in all formats. Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#45)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($10,200)  FanDuel ($9,300)  Looking at that same Strokes Gained: Ball Striking stat, Tony Finau ranks #2 behind Stanley and sits ahead of him in the overall model. This is due to his 3rd rank in Par 4 Scoring, 2nd rank in Par 5 Scoring, 4th rank in Birdie or Better %, and 10th rank in Bogey Avoidance.
Stanley  ->  positive

Hitting greens in regulation won’t be an issue for most of the field, placing an emphasis on more specific statistics such as average proximity to the hole and SG: putting. Past Champions    2017- Justin Thomas  2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth - $15,900    Spieth is the most expensive player on the board this week thanks to his brilliant combination of course history and recent form. The No.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

And like last year, the wind is forecast to be fairly benign, especially for an oceanside course, so scoring could approach Spieth's near-record of 30-under. Key Stats to Winning at Kapalua    • Driving distance  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling  • One-putt percentage (putts per GIR)    Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy  2009 - Geoff Ogilvy  2008 - Daniel Chopra  2007 - Vijay Singh    Champion's Profile    When we see 400-plus-yard drives, it's only natural to think this course favors the biggest hitters. But other than Dustin Johnson four years ago, the champions have been of standard length -- or in the case of Zach Johnson in 2014 and Steve Stricker in 2012, even sub-standard.
Spieth's  ->  positive

A win here would further elevate his status in the game, and it looks to be a great event for him to do so. Luke List 80/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Luke List looks exceptional value this week, as he looks to build on his 3rd place finish in Houston two weeks ago. List ranks above average in both Greens in Regulation (33rd) and Scrambling (36th) on the PGA Tour this season and has some very good finishes as a result.
List  ->  positive

Plus in truth, it will be an enormous shock were Martin Flores to challenge for the title, and it will be hard to get his odds to shorten up sufficiently to cash out. Though a winner on last year's Web.com Tour, Flores has rarely even contended at this level. Nevertheless, his credentials point to a respectable finish at least.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

Much like Chez Reavie with solid recent performances I would expect Bradley to be cash chalk and feel that this is well deserved. Chez Reavie – Cash – DK: $8900  Reavie finished the PGA season on a high note making 11 straight cuts. In those 11 tournaments, Reavie finishes inside of the top 25 six times.
Reavie  ->  positive

Add it all up and the risk is much too high for the projected ownership but if you are wanting to get some of that local knowledge in your lineup, roster Webb on FanDuel in the mid $7K range. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage.
Haas  ->  positive

Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
Day  ->  positive

However regarding this plan to restrict one market for each pick, the highest possible target makes sense. I rate Chappell a genuine contender this week and reckon he will thrive in this major over time. Last year's seventh suggested that, as does his skill-set and record on tough courses.
Chappell  ->  positive

The strength of Rose's game, tee to green, would appear to suit the Club de Golf Chapultepec layout. Wildcard: Alex Noren  View player profile  With four European Tour wins in the last seven months Alex Noren is always a threat, wherever he tees it up. Whilst the Swede is yet to perform at that same level in Majors and WGCs, just one top ten in 25 combined starts, he does arrive in Mexico on the back of his best WGC finish of T12th at last year's WGC HSBC Champions.
Noren  ->  positive

We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas. That's some turnaround, especially as he led the field in greens hit last time out, and on balance has to be considered an overreaction.
Fowler  ->  positive

And yet, this course has plenty of attributes that he'll be familiar with and which can bring the best out of him. As with Garcia, a course that runs firm and fast and is framed by trees suits Schwartzel's game and eye while the fairways are Kikuya - just as they are in his native South Africa where the 2011 Masters champ has captured eight of his 11 European Tour wins. His poor start to 2017 has been curious.
Schwartzel's  ->  positive

Instead, I'll take a player at double the odds and make Luke List my 50/1 headline bet. For this lengthy Greg Norman layout where the par fives need two huge bashes, I want a big hitter on board and List is definitely that man. The American is 3rd in Driving Distance this year and, although he's not the most accurate, his power helps rank him 17th in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee.
List  ->  positive

Going into the BMW, Leishman is a very healthy seventh in the FedEx Cup standings after he took another big leap with third place at TPC Boston last time. Leishman got himself in a great position to win the tournament before a poor tee-shot at 10 set him off on the wrong path coming home but it's hard to be too down about a top three. "Game is in a good spot, playing well," Leishman said later.
Leishman  ->  positive

Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
Stricker  ->  positive

In our VIP Spreadsheet, we can see Danny Lee is third in the entire field in field adjusted Greens in Regulation. As a guy who traditionally performs better to the field on par threes and fours then par fives I like Lee a lot this week. Adam Hadwin – Cash – DK: $6900 FD: $7600  Hadwin has cooled off from his great form we saw earlier in the season but he still lines up great for the course and does so at an affordable price.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

I will point out a few golfers I think are overvalued in the raw rankings and a few that are undervalued in the raw rankings. UNDERRATED GOLFERS    Nate Lashley (29.95 Projected Pts): Lashley won't impress you with his cuts-made ratio on the PGA TOUR so far (3-for-10 this season). However, when we realize he is top 50 on TOUR in bogey avoidance, we can assume a correction is in order.
Lashley  ->  positive

Granted, he has since missed another weekend but that came alongside Harold Varner at the Zurich, where they at least fared better in the second round with a combined 65. Kaufman is a big-hitting youngster who should find this test to his liking and with the above in mind might just be able to throw his name into the mix at the same price James Hahn was sent off prior to winning this a year ago. Daniel Berger is attracting money and I can see why - this appears to be a good course for him, signs have been largely positive of late, and he's easily forgiven a missed cut alongside Thomas Pieters in the Zurich where perhaps their similar styles left them vulnerable.
Kaufman  ->  positive

Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast. Reavie has a habit of holding his form, he's currently inside the top-25 ranked players on poa annua and he ranks third for Par 4 performance on the PGA Tour and 12th for GIR, so he looks like a great statistical fit.
Reavie  ->  positive

He’s got a great blend of recent form and course history to bank on here. After him, there are some good values in the $9K range including Russell Henley (see below), Danny Lee and Tony Finau who are all cash game worthy targets. Other players I would consider for this format would be Kevin Streelman, Gary Woodland, Harris English, Nick Taylor and Robert Streb.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th). His putting will need to improve this week, but Augusta greens are a different challenge than anything the South African has faced this season and he knows exactly what to expect of them, after eight starts here.

@BrandenGrace  ->  positive

Aggressive (3rd in Going for the Green) and potent on the par-5s (2nd in par-5 Birdie or Better), Koepka won at Erin Hills which played pretty-much to a PGA Championship format back in June. 5th at Whistling Straits in 2015 and 4th at Baltusrol last year summarise perfectly that Koepka's power-packed game is ideal for the PGA of America's premier title. What really sells his chances to me this week though are a few results on his CV that jump from off the page and his red-hot putter of late.
Koepka  ->  positive

Hard to see him not winning at some point soon and could easily catch everyone off-guard here. I see only upside with Kaymer who was one of only a few players who managed to shoot par or better in all four rounds last week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7,200): Maybe the strangest price of anyone, Oosthuizen put together his third straight solid start last week and also had four rounds of par or better at the Honda—and also lead the field in Greens in Regulation percentage.
Kaymer  ->  positive

DEAN & DELUCA Invitational, May 25th to 28th 2017  Tournament Intro:  Recent DEAN & DELUCA Invitational Winners: 2016 - Jordan Spieth (-17) 2015 - Chris Kirk (-12) 2014 - Adam Scott (-9) 2013 - Boo Weekley (-14) 2012 - Zach Johnson (-12) 2011 - David Toms (-15) 2010 - Zach Johnson (-21) 2009 - Steve Stricker (-17) 2008 - Phil Mickelson (-14) 2007 - Rory Sabbatini (-14) 2006 - Tim Herron (-12) 2005 - Kenny Penny (-19) 2004 - Steve Flesch (-11) 2003 - Kenny Perry (-19) 2002 - Nick Price (-13) 2001 - Sergio García (-13) 2000 - Phil Mickelson (-12)  Top Selections:  Other Picks: Kevin Kisner  Webb Simpson  Graeme McDowell  Harris English    The PGA Tour stays in Texas this week making the short thirty minute journey from Irving to Fort Worth for the 71st DEAN & DELUCA Invitational at Colonial Country Club. Formerly known as the Crowne Plaza Invitational, the PGA Tour announced in February 2016 that Dean & DeLuca had agreed a six-year sponsorship deal to host the longest-tenured tour event at a single venue. Dean & DeLuca retailers operate a chain of upscale grocery stores and with their expansion into Texas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, they will be title sponsors throughout the 2021 season.
Graeme McDowell  ->  positive

Curtis Luck ($6,300): *write-up coming*  Others: Danny Lee, Harold Varner III  High-upside GPP Picks  Billy Horschel ($8,900): Not a play I’m admittedly super confident in but a player whose upside at this course I still respect (much like Luke Donald last week). Horschel is coming off a terrible Friday round at Hilton Head but after a week to recharge (his family just welcomed another child to the world as well) I think he can rebound nicely here. Horschel has always liked tougher tracks and is -13 with no rounds worse than par at TPC San Antonio over his last eight rounds played there.
Horschel  ->  positive

With that being said, lets hop into some of the picks. KEY STATS FOR DFS PGA THIS WEEK:  Strokes Gained T-G Strokes Gained Putting Birdie or Better Drive Distance Fairways Hit GIR  DraftKings PGA Picks of the Week  Jon Rahm ($9800)  Jon Rahm is coming off yet another stellar performance as he finished T15 at the Safeway Open, carding an ace to go with it. We won’t be expecting another ace for Rahm, but we can expect another Top 20 finish.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Marc Leishman did us a huge favour when winning at 45/1 last week but he led from gun to tape and I fancy that would have taken a lot out of him. I'll stay in the 'without Spieth' market and finish off with a punt on Webb Simpson at 33s (he's 40s with). As the each-way terms are still 1/5 1,2,3,4,5 with Spieth taken out, a top six finish for Simpson gets us in the money.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Finally, I can’t resist a small play on Louisiana locals John Peterson and Andrew Loupe. Peterson is a brilliant ball-striker who has rededicated himself and with some results this season, while Loupe is long, aggressive and volatile. It could make for a disaster, but if Loupe is on a going week he can make birdies with the best of them and I can see him being given the opportunity to shine in fourballs in particular, with Peterson likely to stay out of trouble even after a couple of disappointing weeks.
Loupe.  ->  positive

Sweden's Henrik Stenson prepares to putt on the 5th hole on day three of the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links, Troon, Scotland, Saturday July 15, 2017. (Mark Runnacles/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)  IRVINE, Scotland (AP) — Henrik Stenson is pessimistic about his chances of successfully defending the British Open title at Royal Birkdale next week. The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again.
Henrik Stenson  ->  negative

10th at the Sanderson Farms and 7th at the Shriners shows what kind of talent we're dealing with here. Beau was 3rd after 54 holes in Jackson, and in Las Vegas he shot a field-leading -5/66 in the teeth of the Saturday wind to take a step further and lead after 54 holes. 2nd at the Air Capital Classic at Crestview CC in Wichita appeals - PGA West champions Dufner, Vegas, Perez and Swafford have all performed well there, and despite missing the cut on his 2018 debut last week, Hossler was still hitting 80.6% Greens in Regulation.
Vegas  ->  positive

He ranks 12th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and third in Strokes Gained: Around the Green on the year, suggesting he’s on top of pretty much every facet of his game, outside of his putter. Casey hit the ball brilliantly at the Honda Classic but was near dead last in putting for the week (and still finished 11th). He may have found something in Mexico though as he gained strokes on the field putting in the final two rounds.
Casey  ->  positive

Importantly, two of those top-15’s have come in his last two starts, finishing T10 at both The Northern Trust and the Dell Technologies Championship, getting hot at the very best time. Tee-to-green, Rose has stood out in the last couple starts, particularly at The Northern Trust, where he ranked 4th in that department. He also led the field in SG: Approach that week and although he struggled with his approaches on his last start (48th), he still looked superb Tee-to-Green ranking inside the top-10 (9th) once again.
Rose  ->  positive

And while glowing praise around his achievements doesn't mean much in relation to this event, Cantlay would be a top-40 player in birdie average terms had he played enough rounds to qualify, and his no-weakness, all-round game seems ideally suited to a course which has thrown up all kinds of players. Cantlay shot 60 when playing in the Travelers Championship as an amateur back in 2011 so his adaptability and scoring prowess is not in question and he does actually have some experience of Conway Farms, having played in the Western Amateur here back in 2009. Video element not supported Cantlay's tee on No.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Even though we haven’t seen his best golf for a while, Lovemark is still ranked 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and has accumulated seven top-10s in the past year and a half on tour. With this sort of pedigree, and a game possibly on the upswing, this is a great time to buy low on Lovemark, as he has plenty of upside for the price we are getting this week on DraftKings. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Justin Rose,  ->  positive

As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
Reed  ->  positive

A veteran now of 2 FedEx Cup Playoff campaigns, he was 13th last year at the Plainfield-hosted Barclays when entering the tournament with indifferent form and was 7th at Conway Farms - an event where Nick Watney finished 2nd in 2013. Matsuyama is clearly warming to the PlayOff task and it's worth remembering that his first PGA Tour win came 'Up-State' at Jack's Tournament in Ohio. Very much a form horse who thrives on Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and whose tee-to-green game - and scrambling - is top notch right now.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He’s a great play in all formats. Adam Scott ($9,200) – Greens, you say? How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world?
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler finished T-3 with Marc Leishman contributing a T-5, but Patrick Reed was the only other top 20 in the professor's picks . Our expert did slightly better, picking Fowler and runner-up Charles Howell III, along with Reed and Bill Haas (T-13). It wasn't pretty -- our version of a 7-6 football game -- but man beats machine for the second straight week, jumping ahead on the season scoreboard.
Reed  ->  positive

Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
Spieth  ->  positive

Far from it in fact. Walker sat second turning for home in round four last year before a dreadful back-nine saw him find water on both 15 and 17 and he showed up in his two previous visits too. He sat second at halfway two years ago and he sat fifth at halfway in 2012.
Walker  ->  positive

Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Chris Kirk - $9,600  2. Harris English - $9,500  3.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Plus, with so much talent and Tiger at the top of this field, it’s likely many will instantly give him a hard pass. Adam Scott  We’ve seen Bubba, Casey and Gary Woodland win over the past two months — the era of bad-putting, supreme ball strikers is upon us. And Scott is the poster boy for that skill set.
Scott  ->  positive

His rankings in SG:T2G (fourth) and scrambling (second) this season on Tour are elite, and it doesn’t hurt that he won this event in the past.Jason Day – $16,900Hideki Matsuyama – $16,900Justin Thomas – $16,500Henrik Stenson – $16,200The Pick: Everyone in this group could conceivably be listed in “The Names” category, as they all have notable victories and elite potential.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Similarly, Brendan Steele and Keegan Bradley are two pals with course form, they too have combined to win the FT Shootout, and their putting issues aren’t too much of a worry here. Clearly, there are options galore at bigger prices but I’ll return towards the top of the market where Justin Thomas and Bud Cauley get the vote at 22/1. Cauley frustrated his backers – of whom few are more loyal than me – with a stop-start T10 last week, but that’s back-to-back top-10 finishes from a seriously-talented player whose career is firmly back on track.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Oosthuizen completed a career grand slam of runner-up finishes in the majors as he shared second with Reed at Quail Hollow, and that's further proof of how big-time he is despite so often proving frustrating. Indeed, his other runner-up finish this year came at the PLAYERS Championship, so while it's 18 months since he last won and seven years since his sole success at the very highest level, Oosthuizen has continued to be a factor in elite company. That much is demonstrated by his record in the FedEx Cup Playoffs.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Suri nearly won his group in the WGC-Matchplay at Austin Country Club, but he finished behind eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Suri was the only one of seven opponents that Bubba didn’t destroy, as he was able to halve his match. A week later, Suri entered the Houston Open and finished eighth with three rounds in the 60s.
Suri  ->  positive

Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him. Cauley ranks 8th in approaches and had some success earlier in 2017 at corollary courses like Hilton Head and the TPC Stadium course.
Cauley  ->  positive

Justin Thomas;  ->  positive

Each of the other three guys had been performing with some degree of promise in advance of their victories. Yet, Donald, who sits 196th in the Official World Golf Ranking and surrendered the title of "low Luke" to Luke List (currently 67th) at the conclusion of 2017, shapes up strongest among the foursome in consumer confidence entering their respective tournaments. There isn't a better test to determine if, when you paint your broad strokes, you prefer course history over recent form.
Luke"  ->  positive

It's a sizable concern that he hasn't won anywhere since the US Open two years ago but I'll be very disappointed if he doesn't at least contend. I've laid out my argument for Ross Fisher in this week's each-way column here and I'm following Paul Krishnamurty in with Alex Levy at a triple-figure price. Selections:  Martin Kaymer [44.0]  Ross Fisher @ [80.0]  Alex levy @ [100.0]    I'll be back later with my Sanderson Farms Championship preview later today.
Ross Fisher  ->  positive

I don't think he will win but I can definitely see a third straight Top 10 finish which would be more than enough to make value. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#39)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,200)  FanDuel ($7,100)    Haas, like Casey, is also one of the six players that ranks Top 20 in stats, history, and form. To be honest, if I blacked out their names on my sheet I would almost not be able to tell the difference between them statistically.
Haas  ->  positive

Selections  Back Rickie Fowler each-way at 18/1 (eight places) Rickie gets the nod but the stats are certainly with anyone backing Matsuyama also. He's also got good course form with T11 on his last visit but Fowler's previous win at Quail Hollow suggests he's the most powerful stats fit.
Fowler  ->  positive

Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
Stenson:  ->  positive

At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

Third on the list is Jordan Spieth who has played here twice and finished Top 10 both times. Spieth's issues over his last three tournaments have been the putting as he has lost strokes to the field in each tournament(Sony, ToC, Tour Champ). I think he figures out this week and of the three, is my favorite play in this tier.
Spieth  ->  positive

Casey has two top-20 finishes at TPC River Highlands in the past two years, including a second-place finish in 2015 when he lost in a playoff. Casey’s 67.9 Course Adjusted Round Score ranks first among golfers with more than one start at this track. Moreover, Casey has been playing well lately: Prior to his 26th-place finish at the U.S. Open, Casey had finished 12th or better in three of four tournaments and hadn’t finished worse than 22nd.
Casey’s  ->  positive

This is also very much his time of year. Poulter has won eight times from October to December versus just two titles across the preceding three months and while that's in part due to field strength, it's also a reflection of the fact he so often has had more to play for than others as the campaign draws to a close. At 54th in the world rankings that's very much the case once more and Poulter will know that gaining access to next year's majors and World Golf Championships is his best route back into the Ryder Cup side.
Poulter  ->  positive

He hasn’t been in the best form, but has played TPC Boston seven times and only once missed the cut, and is simply too good to be offered at this price. Fade: We give you Bubba Watson. Some places fit him, and some don’t.
Bubba Watson.  ->  negative

8th for Greens in Regulation, 2nd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green, 6th for Proximity to Hole and 8th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green show an approach game which is in rude health and Leishman is a proven Bermudagrass green winner who shot -23/261 to win the BMW Championship last August. Brian Harman 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Brian Harman is undoubtedly the form man of the new PGA Tour season and I love his chances here at Waialae this week following on from a stellar third place at Kapalua where he was only beaten by Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

This time, he comes to the Open with links preparation in the bag courtesy of a top-15 finish in the Irish Open and as one of the most reliable drivers in world golf, there's every hope that he can keep out of trouble and allow his deadly iron play to pick apart the golf course. As with every player in the field, there is a negative and that's his putting, but Matsuyama can get away with an average week in that regard if at his best from tee-to-green. Five major top-10s in limited opportunities demonstrate that he's on the brink of a breakthrough and it could well come here.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

This section is going to detail a few of the players who have the best fantasy value comparative to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Marc Leishman 50-1 $6,900 DA Points $6,900 and 200-1  Grayson Murray $7,000 and 300-1  Stewart Cink $7,000 and 125-1 Kevin Tway 90-1 $6,500 Bubba Watson $6,600 and 100-1  K.J. Choi $6,600 and 250-1  Smylie Kaufman $6,600 and 100-1  Course Horses  Ryan Moore has been a great horse at Muirfield Village.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Although he is not really considered salary relief, Ryan should find a way into your lineup as he offers a very high ceiling this week. Notables  Chez Reavie – Ranks 3rd in 400-450 Scoring, 4th in Bogey Avoidance, and 13th in Scrambling. T8 here last year.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

With those injury doubts, I'm willing to let him go there. The other player with a hat-trick of top 10s is Bud Cauley. Okay, they're of a different variety and one was even in a pairs event last week when he finished T5 alongside Justin Thomas in New Orleans.
Bud Cauley.  ->  positive

If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament. A justifiable concern.
Kevin Streelman  ->  positive

His odds have been cut after his form in Scotland but the veteran still looks a dangerous outsider at 66/1 to challenge for the Claret Jug. Alex Noren has surged up the world rankings over the last year with a brilliant run of five victories since last summer. The Swede landed the BMW PGA Championship in May at Wentworth with a stunning final round of 62.
Noren  ->  positive

Studs  *In order of my rankings  Graham DeLaet ($10,600) – DeLaet MC last week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, but had strung together five strong weeks before last. It was a tough track and a tough field, so I’ll give DeLaet a pass. He’s still searching for that first win, and hopefully, the recent win by fellow Canadian Adam Hadwin provides the extra motivation DeLaet needs to break into the winner’s circle.
DeLaet  ->  positive

I think he's a great GPP play and could see using him in cash, but there are some better "on the surface" plays at cheaper price tags for cash games. -- Taras Pitra  Matt Kuchar  This is one of those guys I lock into my rosters every year at Augusta regardless of form. Before last week, it had been a rough season for the veteran, having only recorded one top-25.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Looking at recent play, he's finished top 5 in four of his last six worldwide starts. Cameron Smith ($7,600): The Aussie is red-hot, worldwide. Going to ride the hot hand and play this youngster.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Not sure I could think of a worse course for Thomas Pieters than PGA National.
Thomas Pieters  ->  negative

He’s not as long off the tee as some of the bigger names (only 295 yards on average), but he hits the fairway consistently. Sitting 7th in Ball-Striking (combination of Total Driving and GIR), Casey has been great on Approach (3rd in SG:App), although a little lacking outside 200 yards which could mean some trouble. Between 150-17 and 175-200 however, Casey is 9th and 4th respectively and overall ranks 23rd in Proximity to the Hole which has helped him find 70.68% of Greens in Regulation.
Casey  ->  positive

Players that have good recent form over the last three or four events tend to go well here. Ryan Moore 18/1  Local Ryan Moore has had a fairly steady start to the season with a T17 at The CIMB Classic in Malaysia and a T23 at The WGC HSBC Champions last week which would have been a lot better if it weren’t for a final round 75. He had a great week in Hazeltine winning two points from three for his US team.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Chesson Hadley 45/1  I like the look of the in-form Chesson Hadley on a course he has expressed his liking for in the past. Hadley has been playing well over the last couple of months with four top 5’s and a top 25 in his last eight starts. He began the season in style with a T3 at the Safeway Open, a solo second at the Sanderson Farms which included four rounds of 70 or better and a T4 at the Shriners Open in Vegas, which included a 65,68,69 over the weekend to post eight under par for the tournament.
Hadley  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth. Look, if he didn’t have to compare his season to the monster one he put together a year ago, Spieth would be just fine. He’s won twice and has eight top 10s.
Spieth.  ->  positive

Sure, making two of his past six cuts isn’t all that great, but he finally got all his irons clicking again in Orlando, gaining a tournament-high eight strokes on approaches. Hoge ranks tops in the field in proximity from beyond 200 yards over the past 24 rounds and 10th from 175-200 yards. Of course, like most players on this list, his weekend status will rest on his flat stick.
Hoge  ->  positive

Errant drives are captured by tough Bermudagrass rough with most fairways on the property being tree-lined ensuring plenty of blocked approach shots for those that deviate. Slashing the ball from the tee was a real negative until both Jordan Spieth's and Chris Kirk's victories here across the past 2 renewals. Both only hit 50% of fairways but from there miraculous scrambling and red-hot putters across both players delivered a new way of conquering Colonial.
Chris Kirk's  ->  positive

Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us. His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s.
Casey  ->  positive

Zach has always been known for his short-game and in particular his putting, but so far this season he currently ranks just 81st in Strokes Gained: Putting, and should he find his touch on the greens, a win could be on the horizon. In his four starts on Bermuda greens so far this season, Johnson has ranked 33rd, 40th, 65th and 29th in SG: Putting and whilst it is encouraging that his best effort came last week, there is clearly scope for improvement. Should he find something on the greens this week, that he has struggled to so far this season, Johnson could well be in contention come Sunday.
Johnson  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Matt Kuchar  Vegas Odds - 15/1  Draftkings - $11,500  FantasyAces - $6,000  Kuch went a second straight season without a win but recorded 11 Top 10's, his third highest total of his career. He once again proved to be one of the most consistent talents we have on Tour missing just two cuts in 26 events.

@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,800) Hadwin doesn’t have the prettiest track record here, making 1/2 cuts with a 71st in 2015, but there is no way he should be this cheap with the way he has played this season. After missing the cut at The Safeway Open to start the season back in October, he hasn’t looked back making eight straight cuts, with four top 25s, two top tens, and a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

Using the Strokes Gained stats, he was ranked 1st in Approach-The-Green last week, gaining 8.652 shots on the field. Scrambling is another key at Augusta National and Spieth was 9th in Houston with 78.6%. One other hugely underrated stat at the US Masters is Bogey Avoidance.
Spieth  ->  positive

Leishman ranked sixth and fifth in Greens in Regulation Percentage in his appearances at the DEAN & DELUCA and the Byron Nelson, and he was also second in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee last week at the Memorial. For the season, Leishman ranks 25th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee stats and has nice major championship experience to fall back on this week, too, with a T4 at Augusta from back in 2011 and a famous playoff loss at the Open Championship in 2015. Leishman is also coming off his best finish ever at a U.S. Open (T18) from last season and is a known wind player who has thrived at open-style venues in the past; including the ultimate links test at St. Andrews.
Leishman  ->  positive

Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town. He is a safe cash game play but does not provide much upside in tournaments.
Molinari  ->  positive

Situated on the outskirts of Jack’s hometown Columbus, the par-72 layout is best described as long but forgiving off the tee with plenty of short-game challenge around the greens. Despite Rory McIlroy’s withdrawal from the event Monday, the 120-player field will showcase six of the world’s top 10 including Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, and 2014 champion Hideki Matsuyama. As the highest purse behind only the four majors, THE PLAYERS, and the four WGC events, there’s plenty to get excited about in Columbus this week.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.
Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

Tony Finau is coached by Daniel Summerhays’ brother and they rate an interesting team at 50/1 – they’re another twosome with very different skills and perhaps the consistency of Summerhays will work nicely with Finau’s undoubted scoring prowess. However, at similar odds and with similar make-ups I much prefer the course credentials of Luke Donald and Jamie Lovemark. Donald loves a Dye layout, even if he must be growing fed up of finishing second at Harbour Town, and he was inside the top 10 on both visits here in 2011 and 2012.
Donald  ->  positive

A better case for Finau is his skill set and recent form. One of the PGA Tour’s premier bombers, Finau actually has been better with his irons and short game lately. In his past five starts, he’s gaining an average of three strokes per tournament with approaches, and he has only bled strokes to the field around the greens in one of his past seven measured events.
Finau  ->  positive

High Cost Players - Fantasy Golf Lineup Picks for DraftKings (PGA DFS)  Build a lineup with either: Justin Thomas ($11,900) or Bill Haas ($9,200)  Two different types of players but both come back to the Copperhead with some nice course history. Thomas finished T18 last season and T10 the year before in his first trip while Haas finished runner-up last season after a playoff loss to Charl Schwartzel and T14 back in 2014. Thomas comes into this week with the FedEx Cup points lead after picking up three wins in his first nine events this season.
Haas  ->  positive

Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Barclays:4 win D Johnson(10), 1ew Oosthuizen (60), 1ew Horschel (100), 1ew Matsuyama (30), 0.5ew Woodland (125)
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He has twice been inside the top five of the Open including at Hoylake in 2014 – a course which is a short distance from Birkdale. Fowler is third for strokes gained putting this season and first for scoring average on the PGA Tour. This looks another huge opportunity for Fowler to join the growing list of first-time major champions and should be backed even though generous odds of 33/1 are long gone.
Fowler  ->  positive

Has had success in past WGC events as well as he was runner-up to Rory McIlory in the match-play event in 2015. Other: Paul Casey (first in strokes gained: tee to green last week)  Value Picks  Martin Kaymer ($7,500): Kaymer was great last week and now his price has come down past some people he was priced in front of last week in a weaker field. He hasn’t missed a cut in over a year which may not matter much since there’s no cut this week, but it speaks to his consistency which is unmatched at the moment.
Martin Kaymer  ->  positive

2. Dustin Johnson  This article has been easy so far as I cannot possibly think of any other golfer who will have an absolute boom – again – than the straightest, longest player on the PGA Tour. Ever since DJ learned how to master his wedge game, he’s been an absolute force.
DJ  ->  positive

Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course. Hadwin is playable in all formats this week. Jason Rouslin: Cameron Smith ($6,900)  Smith made it in as an alternate last week in Scottsdale, and he turned that opportunity into a decent 42nd place finish.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance. What makes Scott an elite golfer and always in contention is his game on the way to the greens, as he’s a longer hitter off the tee with an average drive of 302, and hits good drives 84.4% of the time.
Scott  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR. It was therefore with some amusement that those of us on this side of the pond watched the US lead coverage from Torrey Pines 3 weeks ago, during which we were treated to interviews and commentary that portrayed Alex as a complete rookie, who would potentially react like a rabbit in the headlights when faced with the possibility of winning on US soil!
Noren.  ->  positive

U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka must be licking his lips when it comes to Quail Hollow. Aggressive (3rd in Going for the Green) and potent on the par-5s (2nd in par-5 Birdie or Better), Koepka won at Erin Hills which played pretty-much to a PGA Championship format back in June. 5th at Whistling Straits in 2015 and 4th at Baltusrol last year summarise perfectly that Koepka's power-packed game is ideal for the PGA of America's premier title.
Koepka  ->  positive

Tommy Fleetwood at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) – the best ball-striker in Europe lately can demonstrate that he is firmly on the rise  1pt e.w. Matt Fitzpatrick at 125/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – three wins already and accuracy from the tee could take him a long way  1pt Kevin Na in top-five and top-10 markets at 25/1 and 10/1 respectively – should go well on the back of fourth last time out  When the PGA Tour decided that Trump National Doral was no longer for them, they meant it, because the contrast between Doral and Club de Golf Chapultepec, home of the revamped WGC-Mexico Championship, looks to be a stark one. Post-revamp, Doral had become a long-ball paradise unlike any other.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 31st  The mention of Bozzelli above leads me on nicely to my last selection of the week. Regular readers will know that I was on Bozzelli a couple of weeks ago at the Honda at the massive odds of 350-1. Whilst we got no return on that investment his finish of 13th place more than justified my view that he is a player to keep an eye on and one who could well reward backers at a big price in the near future.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

This week you can expect things to be a bit unique in that it’s a short field WGC event with no cut and there always tends to be a few surprises that get thrown into the mix on weeks like this. That being said the Salary Vs. Vegas Odds chart brings us the likes of Jimmy Walker who at roughly 60:1 odds is only $7,000 and on the surface seems underpriced. I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Rickie Fowler 1pt EW 20/1  Jon Rahm 1pt EW 20/1  Thomas Pieters 0.5pts EW 40/1  Branden Grace 0.5pts EW 40/1  Kevin Kisner 0.5pts EW 55/1  Total staked = 7 pts  *Paddypower paying 8 places*  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6/ Kisner is another proven wind specialist and could be another one to keep an eye on here. The American also ticks a few key statistical boxes here ranking 12th in driving accuracy, 23rd in strokes gained putting and 28th in scrambling.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Rahm is a serious talent and its only a matter of time before he wins not one, but multiple major championships in the future. Thomas Pieters 40/1  Pieters has had a good season so far and could be another player that could suit a long, tricky test like Erin Hills. He played well at the Dubai Desert Classic back in February finishing T23 and followed that with a T5 at the WGC Mexico Championship and a T4 in Augusta, which included two 68’s.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

He is a bomber who putts well and although he can be a little wild, we get a huge break in pricing versus his odds to win the event allowing us to use him early this week. Erik Dantoft: Brandon Hagy ($8,300) (FanDuel, rounds 1 and 2)  Hagy is an ideal round 1-2 golfer this week on FanDuel. His inexpensive salary allows you to spend up for a top tier round 3-4 golfer, but more importantly, Hagy is in a great position to score you some early round 1-2 fantasy points with the likelihood of adding some finishing points at the end of the tournament as well.
Hagy  ->  positive

With Ryan Moore at a premium price, Kirk is as good an option to anchor your lineup as any. His form will be his main calling card this week — the Georgia product is currently riding a wave of top 10s, including a tie for second at last week’s Sanderson Farms Championship. While Kirk has finished no better than a tie for 36th in either of his two appearances at the Shriners, the relatively poor caliber of this week’s field helps him to stand out.
Kirk  ->  positive

This contest has a large number of entries, with guaranteed prize payouts, which means we can't play it safe if we want to see our name at the top! DraftKings Picks:    Chris Kirk ($11,300): s the Vegas favorite, he also gets the billing of highest-priced DK golfer. The hope is the deters some ownership away from him, since he's not usually the top dog on the board.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Ride the wave of hot irons, and hope the short game falls into place. Cameron Smith  After an amazing run in Australia late last year, Smith came into 2018 with a ton of hype. People even were putting him in the conversation to win at both events in Hawaii.
Smith  ->  positive

Like Steele, Finau has had some weight behind him this week in the DFS community and will be fairly highly owned. Greg Owen ($6400): Although he’s been around since before the Earth was formed (turned pro in 1992), Greg Owen has been fantastic in every sense of the word this year in getting from tee to green. He’s T14 in Total Driving, has been absolutely nails in finding greens (73.06%, 8th on Tour), and has an outstanding birdie average of 4.25.
Greg Owen  ->  positive

However thrilling it was to see Tiger in contention, he didn't quite win and while I don't hold that against him, we are talking about a different player and a different sport now. When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite.
Fowler  ->  positive

While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts. Statistically, Chappell also seems to suit the TPC San Antonio course well as he ranks inside the top-40 in both Driving Distance and par 5 scoring, even after his poor start to the year. To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68.
Chappell  ->  positive

With news breaking that he could miss the US Open for his daughter’s graduation, Phil will have extra incentive to win this week. Russell Henley ($9,800)  In most weeks we would advise against paying this much for Henley. But in a weak field where he placed seventh last season, we are advising it.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Current form, course form and motivation could be converging nicely. RESULT: T35  Matt Kuchar 1.25pts EW 40/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places EW, 1/5):  I also like Matt Kuchar this week on a course where he's finished 6th across both the National Pro-Am and the 2010 U.S. Open. Yes he doesn't win enough, but a 40/1 shot this week has a little juice within it and as Gary Woodland proved last week, short-term momentum can sometimes get these kind of players over the line.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Chasing another achievable double this week with Frittelli (45/1) into Rose/Stenson (7/1). Those prices won't last
Rose/Stenson  ->  positive

Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
Horschel  ->  positive

We surely need - and require - something better from the top price in the field. Spieth has been playing well for months, with five straight top-10s going back to autumn. This format is not for everyone, but Spieth says he likes it, and that counts for a lot (plus he said they give him "great food").
Spieth  ->  positive

Hadwin ranks T5 alongside Steele in Par 5 Performance and 18th in Strokes Gained: Putting (down from 7th last week), so statistically he ticks the boxes for this event. Billy Horschel ($8,900) – Horschel loves this course and once again if he can get hot with the putter, he will contend. He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

High-Priced  UPDATE: Dustin Johnson (back) took a serious fall in his Augusta Rental home and is now QUESTIONABLE to compete at the Masters. Dustin Johnson ($11,300) – I suppose it is strictly by virtue of the lack of a green jacket that he is not the top-priced option on the board, but no matter how good Spieth has been at Augusta, it doesn’t seem right that DJ costs less right now. He rested after his win at the Match Play Championship, so he should be relaxed and focused for the year’s first major.
DJ  ->  positive

Given the very minimum price tag, the tee to green ability, the close calls this season and the scoring upside, he’s in play for GPPs this week. Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should.
Tony  ->  negative

Harman ranked 2nd in Strokes Gained: Putting in Mexico, but just 31st in Par 5 Performance, so should he improve on the long holes here, he should be bang in contention. Adam Scott 40/1 (UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Adam Scott has made a strong return to form during the Florida Swing, after struggling for much of last season and the start of this one, so he will hope that can continue that here at Bay Hill this week. The Australian had a strong record here, before missing the cut in 2006 and 2009 and a lenghty absence from 2010-2013.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

But before that he played a starring role alongside Scott Brown to reach a play-off at the Zurich Classic after holing out for eagle at the 72nd and wind back a little further and he was T11 at Hilton Head and runner-up at Bay Hill. Kisner can have a pattern of peaks and troughs in his results and his second place at The Heritage in 2015 was on the back of a missed cut in Houston on his previous start. Go back further and his Web.com win in Chile in 2013 came after he'd had a string of five weekends off.
Kisner  ->  positive

He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions. Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Reed’s  ->  positive

Ross Fisher – $6,900  Ross Fisher was a late addition to The Masters field, so he will definitely be overlooked and less hyped up than other golfers. His pricing fell into a crowded range with Adam Hadwin and Kevin Kisner. Fisher is a lesser known player on the PGA Tour as he is a predominately a Euro Tour golfer, which will help suppress his ownership further.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Fire up Steele in all formats. Jimmy Walker  World Golf Ranking (#25)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($10,500)  FanDuel ($9,700)  After a rough start to the season where he missed three of his first five cuts and a near dead last finish at the HSBC Champions, Walker is starting to pick up steam. He has made seven straight cuts including a T18 most recently at the Masters.
Walker  ->  positive

Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required. An undoubted talent, Na might not trouble the winner's interviewer nearly enough, but at 64th in the OWGR and 40th in the FedEx Cup series, the Las Vegas man will be gunning for a top 5 finish this week to grab a coveted East Lake spot. He has previous with this back in 2015 when he travelled to Chicago in 34th spot in the FEC standings.
Na  ->  positive

296 yards (64th), 64.3% fairways (18th), 81.9% greens in regulation (4th), 34"3" proximity to hole (21st), 30.8 % scrambling (71st), 1.58 putts per GIR (1st). 2013, Webb Simpson (-24). 300 yards (55th), 64.3% fairways (13th), 86.1% greens in regulation (4th), 31"1" proximity to hole (4th), 62.5% scrambling (10th), 1.65 putts per GIR (5th).
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

I think he has a real chance this week to win and cement his Presidents Cup spot. RESULT: T17  Zach Johnson 1pt EW 70/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Zach Johnson is another who I like this week. 42nd in the FedEx Cup standings and as lowly as 28th in the Presidents Cup standings, Johnson will want to perform at Glen Oaks this week to continue the end-of-season momentum he's generated across recent up-state appearances.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

I am looking for him to continue his success this week with another top 10. Jimmy Walker-  Walker has owned this course in recent years with 3 top 12 finishes in the last 4 years, with a T-50 finish last year due to a final round 78, otherwise it could have been another nice result. Last season Walker finished top 25 in par 4 birdie or better scoring, T-17 in birdie average and 46th in strokes gained putting.
Walker-  ->  positive

He'll make his debut in this event with ranks of 19th in BP and 49th in DD. Fade - Anirban Lahiri (59K): Lahiri ranks ninth in BP, which is the best rank in the field, but he ranks outside the top 100 in DD and SGA. He'll also be making his tournament debut, following up a 44th-placed finish at the RBC Heritage.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  negative

He’s one of my favorite targets this week on DraftKings and a player you shouldn’t overlook based his sub-par results from earlier in the year. My Value: Marc Leishman ($6,700)  Leishman has had a strong season by any standard thus far as the Aussie picked up his second career win on the PGA this year at the tough Bay Hill CC, and has also amassed a total of seven top-25 finishes in 13 starts so far. The former rookie of the year may finally be ready to reach his full potential this season and has looked solid over his last few starts.
Leishman  ->  positive

You decide! Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course. It's no wonder he has a stellar track record in major championships.
Spieth  ->  positive

Don’t overthink Rahm GOAT this week. Rickie Fowler ($10,000) – Rickie is a different player in 2017. He is bringing it week to week and his stats backing it up.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Now when it comes to the longer holes (200-225) Hadley is not as impressive, ranking 60th and averaging a touch over-par, but most will here this week anyway so that doesn’t put me off too much. Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past. At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago).
Hadley  ->  positive

Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play. The other standout is probably one that you’ve heard mentioned elsewhere in Charley Hoffman. It seems fairly obvious that Hoffman is under priced this week, which is in agreement with the charts.
Hoffman.  ->  positive

Rose, Snedeker, Kuchar, Furyk, and Lowry come to mind (see below). Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Cameron Smith; 3) Marc Leishman; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Wesley Bryan; 7) Ollie Schniederjans; 8) Daniel Berger / Zach Johnson; 10) Kyle Stanley; 11) Chris Stroud; 12) Kevin Na / Peter Uihlein; 14) Brian Gay; 15) Luke Donald; 16) Tony Finau / Ben Martin; 18) Russell Henley / Chez Reavie; 20) Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices : 2017: Justin Thomas 14/1 ; 2016: Gomez 100/1 ; 2015: Walker 18/1 ; 2014: Walker 40/1 ; 2013: Henley 100/1 ; 2012: Wagner 125/1 ; 2011: Wilson 80/1 ; 2010: Palmer 250/1 ;. Average: 91/1.
Walker  ->  positive

Had Harman have just shot level par on the opening day (he broke par in each of the last three rounds), he would have finish in a tie for 2nd. It was a similar story in 2016, when Harman finished T17, as Harman finished two shots shy of the three players who were tied for 9th. This time around though, he had no horrific rounds, he was just steady all week long (69-71-70-70).
Harman  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Puerto Rico Open - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Luke List 1.5pt EW 28/1 with bet £5 get £20 free via this link:  Luke List is definitely the sort of player who wins the Puerto Rico Open. Powerful (2nd in Driving Distance), a great second-shot player (38th in Strokes Gained Approach to the Green), who can score heavily (9th Birdie Average, 19th Scoring Average).
Luke List  ->  positive

For cash games rostering two of Rahm, Stenson, Rose, Rickie, Scott, over jamming Spieth in, seems more optimal. Of the higher priced plays I prefer Fowler ($10,000), Rose ($9,700) and Stenson ($10,400) who are all rested after skipping the match play. Some solid lower tier values could be Billy Horschel ($7,700), Tony Finau ($7,100) and Ollie Schniederjans ($6,700).
Fowler  ->  positive

He's definitely become a little more conservative to avoid those ghastly big numbers we were always accustomed to seeing, but 3 eagles over his last 7 rounds highlight that he can still cause damage on the par-5s. A 3-time PGA Tour winner, Vegas has won both the 2016 and 2017 RBC Canadian Opens held at Glen Abbey. The 2016 win featured Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and 3rd at Glen Oaks last August, in addition to his 3rd here in 2011, highlights that Jhonattan is comfortable on Poa Annua.
Jhonattan  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Patrick Reed – $9,700  Patrick Reed has been on the struggle bus all season long. His last top 15 finish was at the CareerBuilder in January and has yet to finish inside the top 20 since.
Patrick Reed  ->  negative

His game is dialed in, and I expect it to continue on this coastal course. Kisner ranks 12th in SG: Approach, 41st in Scrambling, 42nd in SG: Off the Tee, and 37th in Birdie or Better %. At this price point, Kisner makes for a quality core play.
Kisner  ->  positive

PGA Tour Fantasy Golf DraftKings Picks – The Puerto Rico Open  Lock of the week:  Luke List $9,900 – Luke is in solid form coming off his T17 at the API. He’s played this event twice without a missed cut, including a T15 last year. We’ve heard from sources on site that the rough is basically non existent.
Luke List  ->  positive

This week, we head to TPC River Highlands for the Travelers Championship. This year’s field has a few headliners in Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, and Rory McIlroy, but is fairly weak after the top 20-25 players. Last year, the Travelers was held after the PGA Championship, but it’s been bumped up in the ever-changing schedule.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

It may be wise not to overthink it so I'm looking for a player with a strong record in NC which includes big finishes at the Wells Fargo. Step forward Webb Simpson. Back in 2011, I had a 20/1 'win only' punt on Simpson landing the Wyndham Championship and he obliged, shooting 66-65-64-67 to secure his maiden PGA Tour title.
Simpson.  ->  positive

And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday.
Chris Stroud,  ->  positive

Instead, head has to rule the heart and therefore it's time to take advantage of the slightly inflated odds on Justin Rose. Tiger's 6/1 means Rose is a couple of points bigger than he would have been without the great man's revival and 14/1 looks very acceptable indeed. The Englishman admitted he'd found the WGC-Mexico a hard event to make his comeback after more than a month off due to the altitude and pulling of funky clubs.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

If you do use Phil make sure you check for any late breaking news on his status. My Pick: Jamie Lovemark ($9,600)  Lovemark is off to a fantastic start to the 2017 season, and one has to think his first win can’t be far away. With a T6 and a T4 in his last two starts, Lovemark will again tee it up at PGA West where he was in the mix last year before bombing with a one-over final round.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Also like: Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70. Sounds a bit like TPC River Highlands, where he just won.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

The T5 came in the US Open, the T20 in the Open Championship, the T13 in the WGC-Bridgestone and the T17 in The Northern Trust. Any ideas that his top five in the US Open was a one-week-only tale of little guy did good is simply wrong; Schauffele keeps going up against the world's best and performing with credit. His excellent effort at Erin Hills in the year's second major was the turning point though.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Don’t care. Rose has been in REALLY strong form basically all year, he’s just lacking a win. He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old.
Rose  ->  positive

Spieth ranks 22nd on tour in that range and was 10th before struggling with the new greens at the Players. Backing up his putting, Spieth ranks 2nd in BA and BoB% and he comes in 6th in Par 4 Scoring. Coming off missed cuts in two of his last three events, we may get Spieth at reduced ownership this week, which makes him a great play in GPPs.
Spieth  ->  positive

Recommended bets: The Northern Trust 1pt e.w. Patrick Reed at 40/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - defending champion is close to another win after best major finish 1pt e.w. Louis Oosthuizen at 45/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - superbly consistent Playoff record and arrives after T2 in the PGA 1pt e.w.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week. Xander Schauffele, $8800 – Probably the best value of the week, Schauffele will get his first look at Club de Golf Chapultepec in competition.
Pieters,  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Cantlay.  ->  positive

It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
Fathauer  ->  positive

I see only upside with Kaymer who was one of only a few players who managed to shoot par or better in all four rounds last week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7,200): Maybe the strangest price of anyone, Oosthuizen put together his third straight solid start last week and also had four rounds of par or better at the Honda—and also lead the field in Greens in Regulation percentage. Oosthuizen has been uber-solid off the tee in his last two starts ranking 8th and 11th for Driving accuracy respectively.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

He has been owned by an average of 33.3 percent of lineups in those tournaments. Last year, with a salary $500 lower, Johnson tipped the scales at 42.8 percent average ownership on his way to 123.5 DraftKings points and a +49.09 Plus/Minus. You can check out player exposure and much more with our PGA Contests Dashboard.
Johnson  ->  positive

Greenbrier Classic Picks! Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9100 FD: $8900  All season watching Finau play I have been waiting for the inevitable breakout win and where better than this weak field. Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory.
Finau  ->  positive

His price is a little high over at FanDuel making him GPP only but on DraftKings under $9K, I will be using him in all formats. Bud Cauley  World Golf Ranking (#107)  Vegas Odds (33/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($9,500)  Bud Cauley is another player who has trended in the right direction here at the CareerBuilder Challenge over the past few years with finishes of T14 in 2016 and T3 last year after a missed cut in 2014, T37 in 2013, and T30 in his first trip in 2012. Form was definitely not an issue over the two years as he came into the 2016 event with two missed cuts and went into last years event with four missed cuts and a T50.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Ranked No. 1 in the world, Day should also benefit from a three-week break following his runner-up finish at the PGA Championship. David Jayne -- Keegan Bradley ($7,600)  Bradley is in solid form coming in with six consecutive made cuts with three top-25 finishes, and needs to play well to improve his current 106th place standing in the FedEx Cup.
Day  ->  positive

J.B Holmes -$6,800  J.B. Holmes is still underpriced, even with DraftKings reverting back to their old pricing system. $6,800 for Holmes is just way too cheap, especially when we are (almost) guaranteed 72 holes from him. Holmes is one of the best birdie makers in the field and will be flipping wedges into these greens all week long.
Holmes  ->  positive

He played well at the OHL Classic at the starts of the season finishing solo second and followed that with a T6 at The Sony Open in Hawaii and a T20 at The Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines. Most recently Woodland had a super performance at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am shooting 67,65 over the weekend to finish T5 on 12 under. He followed that with another solid performance last week at The Honda shooting rounds of 71,66,66,69 to finish eight under and T2 for the tournament.
Woodland  ->  positive

Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price. Finally, I want to side with Kevin Na in some way and the top-five and top-10 markets look best. In essence, Na is another accurate type, with form at altitude and at some of the PGA Tour’s tighter courses, such as Harbour Town and Silverado.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

Let’s jump into the picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama ($11,500/$11,400) – Look, I understand Jordan Spieth played out of his dome last week, and I have no doubt he could ship this week too. But to put DJ and Hideki at $1,100 and $1,200 below him this week is simply blasphemous.
Johnson/Hideki  ->  positive

This preview will look at all those available for the official European Tour fantasy game. Open champion Jordan Spieth is amongst a raft of players, writers, oddsmakers and gamers to have pencilled in the Northern Irishman as the man to beat this week and McIlroy is likely to form the bedrock of most fantasy teams. The North Carolina track has staged the regular-season Wells Fargo Championship (previously Quail Hollow Championship and Wachovia Championship) on 13 occasions and Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015.
Rory  ->  positive

I am willing to go with the field on this one and play Harman within my lineups. Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week.
Harman  ->  positive

By PGA standards this is very short and the scores reflect this. Last year Pat Perez won the event at -21 and the weekend cut was -2. With a lot of scoring opportunity for players, this event tends to turn into a birdie fest as long as the weather cooperates (which it looks like it will).
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Few darts on the machine this week for the #SentryTournamentofChampions Kisner 42.0 Berger 65.0 Kim 170.0
Kim  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with five players this week as follows;  MARTIN PILLER – 200-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED MC  For my first and if you like my headline selection this week I am going to actually start with by far the biggest priced player in my team in the form of a Lone Star State guy Martin Piller. The reason to be Piller heads the list this week is basically his price. I really don’t get it and would say 100s is as big as he should be and certainly not 200s.
Piller.  ->  positive

In 17 starts, Sergio has missed the cut twice! If there's one guy who could be called the horse for this course, it would be Sergio Garcia.. -- Michael Collins  Rickie Fowler  In 2015, Fowler played world-class golf down the closing stretch at TPC Sawgrass to win the Players Championship and plant his flag in the fairway as a world class player, following the "overrated" narrative that started in the media. Now a year removed from the hype of repeating, Fowler has the game to win again at the newly renovated course.
Fowler  ->  positive

Pebble Beach has been one of the better spots for the Australian in recent years, missing just two cuts in his last eight. In that span, Jones has managed to accumulate three top-15 finishes, including an 11th and 7th in the last two renewals. Jones has made four starts in the 2016/17 and played just the once since the turn of the new year.
Jones  ->  positive

In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats. Paul Casey ($9,000): I have been using Casey in every tournament this year so why stop now.
Molinari  ->  positive

Market Leaders  Rory McIlroy (11/1)  Justin Thomas (11/1)  Jordan Spieth (11/1)  Dustin Johnson (12/1)  Tiger Woods (14/1)  Justin Rose (14/1)  Selections  Justin Rose 14/1 (General) 2pts e/w:  Whilst I have umm’d and ahh’d over whether the 14/1 is big enough, I simply can’t get away from the fact that I think Justin Rose is the most likely winner of the 2018 Masters. With two 2nd’s and a 10th place finish in his last three starts here, Rose has done all but win the Green Jacket and probably should have won it last year. He has never missed a cut at Augusta and has finished inside the top-10 five times in 12 starts here, so he looks destined to win one in his career.
Justin Thomas (11/1) Jordan Spieth (11/1) Dustin Johnson (12/1) Tiger Woods (14/1) Justin Rose  ->  positive

He’s playing the absolute best golf of his career, and you’d be crazy to not start almost every GPP lineup you create with him this week. Jason Day ($10,100) – Day fell apart on Sunday (as did many bombers) at Sawgrass, but that shouldn’t take away from the positives we’ve been seeing out of him lately now that he is seemingly healthy. This is a golf course where Jason Day can open up and hulk smash the golf ball with very little concern over whether he’s in the fairway or the rough.
Day  ->  positive

. Course Adj Rd Score (count of at least two): 67.7, Paul Casey ($9,500)  Casey has been on an absolute tear recently. His back-to-back second-place finishes and triple-digit DraftKings scores are sure to make him a popular pick going forward.
Casey  ->  positive

The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
Rory  ->  positive

Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Patton Kizzire already has two wins this season including last week’s win at the Sony Open. Kizzire’s confidence is sky high and the field is one that shouldn’t daunt him. He sits in the top quarter on Tour in all the key stats for the week (strokes gained: approach, Par 5 scoring, birdie or better %), and is now using these events to get ready for The Masters.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

The PGA Tour stays in Texas for this week's Houston Open and Dave Tindall has three each-way bets lined up...  "Ranked 10th in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green this season and 14th in Scoring Average, a good putting week and Finau is a big contender here in my book." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Tony Finau e.w. @ 30/1  With the US Masters a week away, several of the likely Green Jacket contenders are warming up at this week's Shell Houston Open.
Finau  ->  positive

All the time Kirk is three-figures he is worth keeping an eye on in current form, and given his play here in 2013 I thought this could be another chance for him to finish inside the top-5. Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts.
Vaughn Taylor  ->  positive

With the wind set to blow this week I am looking to stick with players who are proven in the wind or/and are renowned ‘ball strikers’ and Knox certainly ticks those boxes. Knox’s renowned ball striking strengths had dipped over the 2016/17 period but his 2018 stats show that he is back on track as he currently lies 38th in Driving Accuracy and 6th in GIR. All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.
Knox  ->  positive

ALEX NOREN – 30-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 36th  No prizes for me for originality I’m afraid as my third pick this week goes to another player who was in our team at the Honda three weeks ago in the form of the inform Alex Noren. For want of copying and pasting my thoughts on Noren back at the Honda I shall simply say the obvious in that the Swede’s start to his first full season on the PGA tour has been hugely impressive. Based on current form there is every argument for his price to be as short, if not shorter than Rickie, Rory, Henrik and a returning Hideki and it is only a lack of course form I’m assuming which has sees him priced up as 30-1 shot.
Noren.  ->  positive

Currently, Reed is looking like a cash game lock and a solid core player in my GPP grouping. Kevin Streelman – FanDuel Value – DK: $7300 FD: $8700  Streelman has been solid lately relying on gaining strokes off of the tee and approaching the green. Although he has been losing strokes putting that can easily turn around week to week and I like the way he has been playing recently.
Kevin Streelman  ->  positive

DJ’s 67.8 LT Adj Rd Score is tied atop this week’s elite field, his 16.6 LT Adj Bird Avg is fifth, and his massive 314.2-yard LT Driving Distance (DD) leads all competitors. Johnson played well in WGC events last season, winning the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and finishing T5, T14, and T5 in three other tournaments. He has three WGC wins in his career.
DJ’s  ->  positive

He is primed for another, as Pat likes to say, “great fantastic” week in Mexico. Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week.
Finau  ->  positive

When the latter dips, he can't really compete so it's been encouraging to see an upturn recently, ranking seventh and eighth in strokes-gained: tee-to-green and inside the top-10 for greens hit in both the Farmers (12th) and Phoenix (26th). Luke List should go well at a big price  List showed up well here on his debut two years ago, sitting second after round one and seventh at halfway only for a third-round 75 to see him fall all the way down to 50th. To his credit, he responded with a best-of-the-day 67 to climb to 20th and with last year's 72-72 seeing him just miss out on the weekend, there's plenty of encouragement when it comes to his course record.
List  ->  positive

Pick to Click: 4 guys above 10k this week. I’m picking Spieth to win until he wins. So, he’s gonna win this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead. While he’s only four for six in cuts made at this event, three of those finishes have been 25th or better and they include a third place from back in 2013.
Tringale  ->  positive

I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts. With Adam, you can always take that his long game is going to be good, so for me, and I don’t know what the betting is, but if there’s value in the price of Adam Scott, that’s who I’d go with.
Scott  ->  positive

This week the winner will need to go low. Bob Harig: Haas ($10,500)  Two of Haas' six career PGA Tour victories have come at this tournament, and while the courses might be different, the same basic principle applies: this is almost like stadium golf in the desert, with perfect weather and conditions. Haas is coming off a tie for 13th in Hawaii and he's shot every round he's played at this tournament under par going back to 2008.
Haas  ->  positive

As luck would have it though his next start happens to be at a venue he has had some good success at in the past in the form of the Oaks Course. Horschel has played this event for the past seven consecutive years and it has been a somewhat bizarre case of ‘feast or famine’ for him with three top four finishes, two missed cuts and a 74th & 75th place finish to his name! Interestingly Hilton Head has never been a particularly happy hunting ground for Billy and on only one occasion has he arrived in San Antonio on the back of a top 10 finish at Harbour Town and he went on to finish 3rd that week.
Billy  ->  positive

Favourites for the event are Rory McIlroy (6/1), Open Champion Jordan Spieth (9/1) and Dustin Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama (Both 12/1)  The last chance to win a Major in 2017 is here, who can take the pressure and claim the Wanamaker Trophy? The Golf Monthly Tipster is having another good season, check out how he has been getting on with our Golf Betting Tips homepage  [collection name=”small” accordion=”mobile” excerpt=8  USPGA Championship Golf Betting Tips Advised Bets – Pre Tournament  Rory McIlroy 10 points to win at 6/1 with sportnation.bet – My biggest bet of the season so far – The Northern Irishman has won here twice – holds the course record, had had two top fives in his last two starts and seems relaxed with his new caddie. Brooks Koepka 4 points each way at 25/1 with sportnation.bet – The US Open Champ feels very long at these odds, the course looks a perfect match for his power game and great putting.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

With all this taken into consideration, here are my picks for the 2017 Shell Houston Open. Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week.
Horschel  ->  positive

The latter was particularly noteworthy in that Leishman at last grabbed an opportunity with both hands, making clutch par saves on the final two holes to win by one in an important, poignant renewal of a high-profile event, securing a win which had in truth been long overdue. All of which sets him up for another big major run, and that's something Leishman is very familiar with. He's only played in 21 of them, but on three occasions has finished inside the top-five, most notably when part of a three-way play-off for the Open Championship which ultimately went to Zach Johnson in 2015.
Leishman  ->  positive

The fact the greens are large this week will help negate his relatively poor chipping as a large percentage of greens will be hit by the field. Molinari can thrive on any course where proximity to the hole is paramount and that can be seen by his last two appearances at TPC Sawgrass where he finished 7th and 6th in elite company. As you would expect for one of the straightest drivers in the game, only Stenson sits above him in driving accuracy for the European Tour season.
Molinari  ->  positive

(60th and 51st in his last two starts) However, he’s placed well both times here in the Bahamas so I expect that to continue. Rickie Fowler- $7,900 Returning to the form reminiscent of what we saw two seasons ago, Fowler’s game is headed in the right direction. Two good showings both times here in the Bahamas and at $7900 I like a top 5 in his future.
Rickie Fowler-  ->  positive

PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
Patrick Cantlay.  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Graham DeLaet  This very talented ball striker can drive fantasy owners crazy by missing cuts when he looks like a great pick, but we need to have a selective memory when it comes to daily fantasy golf. DeLaet makes for an exciting GPP play as he has enormous upside with two top 10s in his last five starts this season and two top-5 finishes in his last three starts at TPC Highlands. He's priced too low this week on FanDuel based upon his odds so there is plenty of value in this pick.-- Zach Turcotte  Brendan Steele  Brendan Steele did his usual thing at the U.S. Open last week -- make the cut and score a bunch of fantasy points.
Graham DeLaet  ->  positive

The average driving distance at Colonial is about 275 yards, largely because longer shots may be penalized. Even though Spieth and Kirk won while ranking down the list in fairways hit, others on the leaderboard and many past champions were highly accurate. Both of them won with terrific putting, while Spieth also was the No.
Kirk  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

The World Number 5 is in a rich vein of form and he continued that last week with 5th place at Copperhead. Despite grabbing the lead at the start of the final round, Rose struggled on Sunday, but if there's one thing we have learnt about the Englishman, it's to keep faith with him when he's playing well. Going back to 2012, here are Rose's performances in the tournament prior to the win: 5th, 8th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 22nd, 10th, 1st, 10th.
Rose  ->  positive

We like this sneaky GPP play. Player to avoid  Brooks Koepka $10,200 – This pains us because we have such a man crush on Brooks. We’ve also been on him heavily since the end of March where he was finding form again.
Brooks Koepka  ->  negative

Paul Stankowski recorded that remarkable achievement in late March and early April of 1996. Hadley can join him at the John Deere Classic where he gained entry as an alternate via Past Champion status. With his path back to the big leagues secure after prevailing at the LECOM Health Challenge on Sunday (to rise to fourth in Web.com earnings), the PGA TOUR's 2013-14 Rookie of the Year was able to accept the spot in the field at TPC Deere Run.
Hadley  ->  positive

He even held the 36-hole lead at Firestone last week before settling for a 28th-place finish at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. Kevin Chappell (+7,500)  Looking for a worthy sleeper this week? How about Kevin Chappell?
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

In 2014, Moore successfully defended the title he first won in 2013. Last year, Justin Thomas made it two double wins in a row in the CIMB Classic. He won in 2015 and 2016.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Putting 10'-15', BoB% (Birdie or Better), Bogey Avoidance, Scrambling, Rough Proximity. Top-Tier Plays  Dustin Johnson ($11,100)  Dustin Johnson is "Taylor Made" for this course. He ranked sixth or better in three of our key stats from 2016 (1stt in BoB%, 4th in Par 5 Scoring, and 6th in Rough Proximity).
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

After winning the Masters last year, Sergio appears to be a much more relaxed player who is more likely to raise a trophy come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton, $10600 – A European Tour staple, Hatton will make his first PGA Tour start this season at the course he finished fourth at last year. Hatton is a great putter who recently finished third at the Dubai Desert Classic, making him worth strong consideration this week.
Hatton,  ->  positive

Capitalize on the field’s reluctance to deploy him on account of his price and recency bias and you may end up finding that he helps you dominate this week. Luke List ($16,500, Mostly GPP) – List has been absolutely red hot since the Fall season began, and his performance last week suggests he’s not stopping now. He has carded nothing worse than a 26th place finish thus far this season, and his combination of absurd power and a surprisingly strong putter (he’s gained 16.34 strokes on the field thus far this season) has put him squarely in our consideration set, particularly on high-scoring tracks.
List  ->  positive

He is also a TCU grad so he has a nice local narrative playing in his favor this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Bud Cauley  Cauley returns to competition this week and has been showing some really good form as of late. If you include the team effort at the Zurich Classic, he has finished in the top-10 in three straight events.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

I don't think he will win but I can definitely see a third straight Top 10 finish which would be more than enough to make value. Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#39)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,200)  FanDuel ($7,100)    Haas, like Casey, is also one of the six players that ranks Top 20 in stats, history, and form. To be honest, if I blacked out their names on my sheet I would almost not be able to tell the difference between them statistically.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Arnold Palmer Invitational Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Jason Day & Rickie Fowler – Any time you’re gifted the ability to stack two Top 10 players into your lineup, you do it. Rickie has already won this season, enters in scotching form (T16, 1st, T4), and sits Top 45 in all facets of the strokes gained metric – Off the Tee (23rd), Approach (6th), Around the Green (43rd), and Putting (5th).
Rickie  ->  positive

Last season, Spieth led the PGA Tour in SG: Approach and ranked 10th in terms of proximity. Hideki Matsuyama - $15,400    Despite his putting struggles, Matsuyama has notched a pair of top-three finishes in two appearances at the Tournament of Champions due to his elite ball-striking. During the 2016-17 season he ranked fifth on Tour in proximity on approaches from 150-175 yards and eighth in proximity from 175-200 yards.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Fade - Zach Johnson (77K): Like Taylor, Johnson doesn't match the course at all. The key difference: Johnson costs triple the salary. He is the fourth-most expensive player in this tier and has failed to crack the top 20 in each of his past two attempts.
Johnson  ->  negative

He came T7 here last season after his T17 finish in his debut. Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds.
Chappell  ->  positive

All 6 winners here since 2012 finished in the top 10 for Strokes Gained Putting on the week. My selections are as follows:  Marc Leishman 2pts EW 16/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  "Well, confidence is pretty high, game's in a good spot.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

It’s the inaugural version of this event, so not much to talk about in the way of past winners. The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

The next piece of the puzzle is his form at Quail Hollow. Chappell has been a regular there and in two of the last three years he's made an impression with T11 in 2014 and T16 in 2015. Last year he opened with a 67 before fading.
Chappell  ->  positive

Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Par 4 Scoring, Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:App), Approaches 150-175 Yards, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G)  Top-Tier Plays  Patrick Reed ($9,300)  The American Ryder Cup star, dubbed the "American Eagle" by many, is back on the right track after losing it for a little bit. From Week 7 to Week 16 (six events), Reed had three missed cuts and did not finish better than 38th. He has turned that around, finishing in the top 20 three times in his last five starts and also posting a 22nd in that span.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Thanks largely to his Mayakoba win, the runner-up finish at the Wells Fargo and a 3rd at this event last season, Perez finished 15th in the FedEx Cup standings which is by far and away his best performance since its inauguration in 2007. Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign.
Perez  ->  positive

Very few signs of life lately and tough to forget the opening-round 79 at the U.S. Open last month. Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
Day  ->  negative

Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut. 12 months on from a switch to PXG, Zach has established what seems a comfortable relationship with his clubs, and the putter really clicked at Waialae last week.
Haas.  ->  positive

Casey,  ->  positive

In 2016 Kevin was in poor form when he arrived at Hilton Head and a disappointing week ensued, however last year he was back in the groove with an 11th place finish, which would have been a lot better but for a poor Sunday. It’s been a slow start to 2018 for Kisner but everything clicked in to place at the Matchplay 3 weeks ago where he finished runner up to Bubba Watson. Last week he backed that up to produce his best finish at Augusta posting a 28th place and I am confident he can continue his good form this week at one of his favourite venues on tour.
Kisner  ->  positive

Horschel finished 11th at the Tournament of Champions to start 2018, before finishing 54th at Torrey Pines and 43rd in Phoenix, so nothing to particularly shout about so far but that doesn’t concern me too much. Horschel tends to play better as the calendar goes on, perhaps taking a while to get into the swing of things (excuse the pun), with all of his wins coming in April or later, and the majority of his top-5 finishes coming in March or later, so I am not too concerned by his average form so far. He is also a better Bermuda putter than he is on other surfaces, ranking 20th in Bermuda Specialists on Futureoffantasy.com  With such strong ties to the Florida area, the only surprise so far at this event is how long it took him to find form here, but now he has, I expect it to be a favourite stop of his for years to come.
Horschel  ->  positive

Should be awesome. Berhow: Dustin Johnson wins at five under, Justin Rose is the runner-up for the second straight major and Mr. Lee Westwood is third. Zak: I've convinced myself that Jason Day will continue his recent solid form and that Erin Hills will play very similar to Whistling Straits (at least for him).
Justin Rose  ->  positive

With all this taken into consideration, here are my picks for the 2017 Shell Houston Open. Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week.
Horschel  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Charley Hoffman 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Charley Hoffman leads the way for me this week and his fifth PGA Tour title can't be too far away as he's playing some exceptional stuff in 2017. 22nd at Augusta, when he went into the final round in 4th spot, 8th at Erin Hills when in the mix all week and 20th last week at Royal Birkdale highlight a player who's having a stellar year.

This week is very different from others.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Kuchar has finished outside the top 15 just once in seven trips here since 2009, with a win and three additional top-five finishes — including a fourth-place finish last year — during that stretch. Unsurprisingly, Kuchar’s 67.2 Course Adj Rd Score leads the field this week. Kuchar’s LT Adj Bird Avg (13.7), LT GIR percentage (67.3), and LT SC percentage (60.4) all rank inside the top 25 of this field.
Kuchar’s  ->  positive

Five Under Five  Mr. Miyagi  As discussed in this week’s Course Breakdown, Ben Crane has had success at some similar TPC courses. In five events at TPC Southwind and The Old White TPC since 2014, Crane has exceeded his salary-based expectations four times (80.0 percent), averaging a strong +16.20 Plus/Minus on DraftKings:  Moreover, Crane dropped 74.50 DraftKings points at TPC Southwind earlier this month, good for a whopping +25.73 Plus/Minus. Additionally, it’s likely that Crane will keep his tee shots out of trouble this week: Crane is tied for 12th in the field with his 65.6 Driving Accuracy (DA) percentage.
Crane  ->  positive

Eventually he’ll get back to putting 4 rounds together and while I don’t see him contending for a win quite yet, I do expect him to notch his first top 20 finish since the Honda Classic in February, at a venue that should fit him well. Also adding Jason Kokrak as a second Semi-Flier this week. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Padraig MC)    Charley Hoffman– This lucky duck nearly hit his first tee ball OB on Thursday at last week’s British Open, then walked off the hole carding an eagle two.
Jason Kokrak  ->  positive

Welp guess Phil and PU may be my highest owned this week. With Rickie.
Phil  ->  positive

Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best. 5th at the 2015 PGA Championship at Oak Hill, 2nd at the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont and 2nd at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational are results that jump from his CV.
Scott  ->  positive

He brings good upside for a cheaper price tag and is a solid target this week in DFS. My Sleeper: Ben Martin ($6,900)  Martin quietly put together four solid rounds last week, finishing his week off with a 65 and a T7 finish. This was the second solid finish in a row for Martin, who also finished T22 in his penultimate start at the RSM Classic.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

Zac Blair at $6500 is like stealing. Great Par 4 scorer.Driving accuracy, bogey avoidance and scrambling rank top 10 on tour.8th two wks ago
Zac Blair  ->  positive

So far this season has been a painful disappointment for Rory however, as he’s battled injury and generally been searching for his best form. The good news is after two consecutive missed cuts there’s nowhere to go but up for McIlroy. The bad news is there’s nothing to suggest the frustration surrounding his game will disappear this week just because it’s a major.
Rory  ->  negative

Longshots:  Wesley Bryan (150-1 to win, 12-1 top 10, 7-1 top 20)  Wesley Bryan enters this week on the back of two missed cuts, so his odds have dropped significantly. Bryan held the 36-hole lead last year en route to a fourth place finish. PGA National brings back good memories for him.
Bryan  ->  positive

John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards). Again like Blair, John Huh is also very accurate off the tee, and this is a course where a lack of distance won’t hurt and it’s a key to put the ball at the right yardage.
Blair,  ->  positive

Having gained strokes on the field with it on three of his five starts here, there can be some hope that Molinari will improve for a return to Bay Hill where he'd desperately like to win - not least because his brother was runner-up here at the start of the decade. At third in strokes-gained off-the-tee so far this season, Molinari junior is exuding control from the tee as usual and that formula is a good one here. Molinari's form figures don't look altogether inspiring, but I don't believe he's played in a truly suitable event so far this season.
Molinari  ->  positive

From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play. Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G. That being said, Murray is one of the best in the field this week with his mid-to-long irons and should be able to find the green in scoring position relatively easily.

Patrick Reed.  ->  negative

There is a correlation between the Bridgestone and the PGA: Every PGA winner since 2007 had been at least T22 at the Bridgestone. Take that for what it's worth, and most of the usual suspects to win this week -- Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Hideki Matsuyama -- were in the top-22 at Firestone. Weather-wise, there was some rain during practice rounds.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

With the likes of Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler all absent this week, this may well be Casey’s best chance of his 18th professional title for the foreseeable future, should he continue his stand-off with the European Tour. The number of European Tour starts Casey needs to make has been in order to be eligible for the 2018 Ryder Cup has been reduced to four, and he is pleased with that decision. In an interview with Yahoo Casey said “Pelley (European Tour CEO Keith Pelley) is changing it down to four next year and that’s a decent change”.
Casey’s  ->  positive

Going by this course and previous US Opens, the main areas of focus are GIR, driving accuracy, driving distance, putting average and scrambling. You can view Erin Hills hole by hole guide by clicking here  Rickie Fowler 20/1  It could be Rickie’s time to bag his first major and who would begrudge him? He arrives in Erin Hills in the best form of his career with a win and six top 10’s so far this season.
Rickie  ->  positive

Moore bounced back with a 69 on the Sunday and finished a very respectable T13. Again last week it was one bad round that cost Moore, with a final round 70 which saw him fall short at the Wyndham Championship, finishing T24. Opening with rounds of 67-65-68 last week suggests he’s showing some form and should the putter get warm this week, he can contend at a course similar to those he’s enjoyed in the past.
Moore,  ->  positive

Most of the field will shy away from challenging the water, however, and that leads to a lot of long irons. Over 33 percent of approach shots come from beyond 200 yards, so it’s no surprise that players such as Tiger, Stenson, Rose, Keegan, Rory and Scott all have experienced success at this event over the years. Quality long irons will help mitigate the difficulty of the long Par 3s (three over 200 yards), the lengthier Par 4s (six over 450 yards), make the Par 5s slightly easier, and potentially open up an eagle opportunity on the 16th hole.
Scott  ->  positive

However, he arrives with -31.1 strokes gained total in his last eight starts. One thing you can usually rely on with Varner is a heap of birdies but those have gone missing as well. He's posted a lower birdie rate than the field in 8 of his last 10 starts.
Varner  ->  positive

It is still hard at this point to predict the winning score this week, given the series of changes made to the course but he has had the goods here in the past and the majority of the course will be the same as it has been in the past. A 4th here last year suggests the change to Bermuda greens did not bother Fowler, and I struggle to see this week panning out without him involved over the weekend. With Matsuyama, McIlroy and Spieth looking so strong, it is hard for anyone to topple them but Fowler is one player that is certainly capable of doing just that.
Fowler,  ->  positive

Bob Harig: Haas ($10,500)  Two of Haas' six career PGA Tour victories have come at this tournament, and while the courses might be different, the same basic principle applies: this is almost like stadium golf in the desert, with perfect weather and conditions. Haas is coming off a tie for 13th in Hawaii and he's shot every round he's played at this tournament under par going back to 2008. Michael Collins: Haas ($10,500)  One-third of his PGA Tour wins have come at this event where he's the all-time leading money winner at almost $3 million earned!
Haas  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

Either way Day has five top-tens in six US Opens and has proven he can peak for this event, I think he’s close and has my vote this week in DFS. Brooks Koepka ($9,000): While the lack of top salaried players on my selections may seem strange, Brooks Koepka, to me, really does bring just as much DraftKings upside this week as the top three salaried players. Brooks has been all over the place in terms of results lately, but even with the inconsistency he’s still managed to produce over 70 DK points in four of his last five starts.
Brooks  ->  positive

High dunes provide great vantage points for spectators of what is widely regarded as one of the truest tests of links golf. It's a tough but fair links and when the wind blows it's a brute - Padraig Harrington won the last renewal staged here in three-over-par! Only the par five 17th hole averaged below par and that's the only time this century that the tournament has been won with an over-par total.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him. Cauley ranks 8th in approaches and had some success earlier in 2017 at corollary courses like Hilton Head and the TPC Stadium course.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Other: Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Francesco Molinari, Phil Mickelson, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Russell Henley, Russell Knox, Stewart Cink, Ricky Barnes  – Charl Schwartzel, Harold Varner III, Peter Uihlein, Sam Saunders, Chez Reavie, Danny Lee, Smylie Kaufman  Bets:  Kyle Stanley 40-1  Peter Uihlein 60-1 ew  Stewart Cink 70-1 ew  Harold Varner III 80-1 ew  Ricky Barnes 200-1 ew  Chez Reavie 160-1 ew  San Saunders 200-1 ew He should be able to bounce back here and is capable of taking advantage of a weaker field to post a top ten finish. Last week he gained strokes on the field in approaches over three rounds, but had a terrible back nine on Sunday.
Ricky Barnes  ->  positive

It's a week for speculative plays in Houston: Reifers 200/1, Cauley 200/1, Flores 225/1, Castro 250/1, Stefani 275/1.
Cauley  ->  positive

My main fancy in Mexico is a fairly speculative one on first look but yet given he won his last tournament, Joost Luiten perhaps shouldn’t be the outsider that the market makes him at 125/1*. Luiten was last seen getting the better of Ryder Cup player Chris Wood in Oman two weeks ago and unusually he putted very well. It is normally tee-to-green supremacy that we associate with Luiten and it was that part of his game that was on show at Chapultepec last year as he ranked 1st in drving accuracy and 1st in GIR.
Luiten  ->  positive

The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
Rory  ->  positive

1pt Lucas Glover top-20 finish at 9/2 BetVictor Glover is still a dicey win proposition because I’m not sure his putting can stand-up to the pressure but his ball-striking alone can get him a top-20 finish. The story seems to be repeating itself in the 2016-17 season but he went close at both the Sanderson Farms Championship and the Shriners.
Glover  ->  positive

Here’s to a great 2018. Thank you to all sponsors @unisyscorp @RBC @United_Rentals @Columbia1938 @Titleist @JaniKingClean”  Whilst we don’t know the full extent, it appears Palmer is in a much better place off the course and if that is the case, then there is every chance the 3-time PGA Tour winner goes well here, on a course he has done everything but win at. At 125/1 I am more than happy to take a chance that his happiness off the course coupled with an improved putting performance, can see Palmer go low here and get the win his form in this event deserves.
Palmer  ->  positive

Valero Texas Open Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Brendan Steele & Branden Grace – On the heels of an impressive Sunday at The Heritage, Grace seems to have finally righted his game. As will be the theme with many of the picks this week, the South African dominates off the tee and with his irons, but is lost on the greens.
Grace  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign: First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2) Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33) Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18) Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25) Jim Furyk (T11-3) Robert Streb (WIN-T25) Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9) Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  Each week I think aloud to provide you with my One-and-Done selection as well as a few alternatives. Fade or Follow?
Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

GMac now moves on to a course where he has had a great amount of success with 5 top 15 finishes in his last 7 visits and at 80-1 I’m happy to take a chance that he can build on last week’s good work. DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016.
Bozzelli.  ->  positive

Bubba Watson also fits this narrative, as he will be fresh from the weekend and ready to attack a course which he’s demolished over his career. Other decent GPP targets include Anirban Lahiri (see below), Bud Cauley ($7,500), Harris English ($6,900) and Derek Fathauer ($6,500). Top Recent Form  1.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

At his peak Rory is a better DFS play than Spieth, regardless of venue, and I’d look for a bounce-back and possibly his first win of the year here after a very disappointing second major. Paul Casey ($9,700): Casey bombed on the weekend at the US Open, but there’s no knee high fescue at TPC River Highlands, and while Casey can sometimes struggle off the tee he’ll be penalised far less for that transgression here. He now ranks third in SG: Approaches and looked in fine form in that regards last week.
Casey  ->  positive

Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now. • • •  Alistair Tait  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

The winner typically finishes in the mid to upper teens under par in ideal conditions. Back in 2015 Alex Cejka finished -7 when the wind was howling as compared to Chesson Hadley coming in at -21 back in 2014. Since the tournament usually features plenty of scoring, we are going to target players with a strong Birdie or Better %.
Cejka  ->  positive

If we ignore Kaufman and Martin then the previous 4 winners all played poorly in Vegas the year before but owned a Top 15 finish from earlier in their careers. Huh fits that profile nicely as he missed the cut last year but had form figures of 28-30-13 from his first three efforts at TPC Summerlin. That on its own wouldn’t be enough but it was actually his total accuracy ranking of 10th over the last 3 months that alerted me to a possible turnaround.
Huh  ->  positive

He was runner-up on his very first Tour Championship appearance in 2013 and so far during the 2017 Playoffs he's finished second at both The Northern Trust and Dell Technologies Championship before closing with a 65 for tied seventh in last week's BMW Championship. Pacing himself is huge and Spieth admits he didn't get it right 12 months ago, the self-mismanagement revealing itself in a rather lacklustre T17 here at East Lake. Reflecting on that at the BMW, he said: "It's a grind physically and mentally.
Spieth  ->  positive

A third round 75 here last year in some very windy conditions ultimately proved his undoing but he battled back on the final day (65) to finish in a tie for third and has excellent claims to improve on that further. He is ranked 12th since 2014 for Strokes Gained on Dye-designed courses if you are a stats boffin and Thomas can confirm he really is among the elite with victory here. Jon Rahm continues to tackle every challenge with some gusto and it doesn’t seem to bother him what venue is in front of him ahead of his Sawgrass debut.
Thomas  ->  positive

After missing the cut last week, Horschel comes at a nice discount, and in a field this soft, he's a strong bounce-back play this week. Jason Rouslin -- Stewart Cink ($6,900)  Stewart comes home to Sea Island Resort course off back-to-back 15th-place finishes. I'm sure spending time at home with his wife, who is battling cancer, and coming in with some great recent form will give him all the extra motivation he needs.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

In his third appearance at the AT&T last year, he placed T10, ranked T2 in par-5 scoring and led the field with four eagles. Matt Jones … The only consistency of his last two seasons has been inconsistency, but the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am has been a sanctuary. Appearing for the 11th consecutive year (and second straight on this page), the 37-year-old Aussie has registered two top 10s and another three top 25s, including in each of the last three editions.
Matt Jones  ->  positive

A great option in all fantasy formats this week. Rickie Fowler  Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff. The brightly-dressed California native returned last year to finish T4.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

He's 4th for Par 4 Birdie or Better Leaders and 33rd in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green while 8th for Driving Accuracy and 21st in Strokes Gained: Putting also bode well. Kaymer has finished in the top 16 for Greens In Regulation in five of his eight Sawgrass appearances so if he can pepper them again and cash in on his currently hot putter, a big title challenge beckons. I've been all around the houses trying to settle on a third pick.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Steve Rawlings takes a look at the local challengers at this week's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale...  “This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.“  Three of the first four in the Top GB & Ireland market are English - Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey - but it's now 25 years since an Englishman won the Open Championship so we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Rose, Casey, Fleetwood and their fellow compatriots, even if one of them, Fleetwood, is playing very close to home. Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose.
Rose,  ->  positive

My final selection is 23 year old world number 211 Michael Kim. A former amateur standout, Kim was voted the best collegiate golfer in America in 2013, generally a decent guide to future success as a pro if previous winners Justin Thomas, Russell Henley, Bill Haas, Ryan Moore and Kevin Chappell are anything to go by. Kim is a PGA Tour sophomore so his body of work is largely incomplete but on debut here last year, he fired a third round 66 on route to a 47th place finish, demonstrating an affinity for the course.
Kim.  ->  positive

With eight places on offer this week, he looks solid each-way value. Back Brendan Steele 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [10.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [5.0]    Next another chance for one of my US Open picks. Steele earned this column a profit at Erin Hills by hitting the lay target when briefly contending during the third round before falling back to 13th.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

While I don't think we need to pay up for List in cash games, I do think we need exposure in GPP formats and we should probably be overweight to the field. Jamie Lovemark  World Golf Ranking (#91)  Vegas Odds (45/1)  Draftkings ($7,700)  FanDuel ($10,000)  Lovemark's form has trended very similarily to List's in that he has bounced back in a big way after some early season struggles where he missed four straight cuts from November to January. Since then, he has made six straight cuts with a Top 10 at the Honda Classic and over his last five events is averaging 68 DraftKings points(5th in the field).
Jamie Lovemark  ->  positive

Possibly, but he's just 13/2, only performing in patches and, whilst acknowledging that he could win this by five, I'd rather have a punt on some bigger prices. One that I'm keen on is Daniel Berger at 55s. There's a well-quoted stat that every time the US PGA has followed the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, records show that the Wanamaker trophy had been in the top 22 at Firestone seven days earlier.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season. After a slow start at Firestone last week, Fowler fired rounds of 67/66 to climb inside the top-10 (9th), continuing his good form and hopefully taking momentum to Charlotte this week.
Fowler  ->  positive

Perhaps it’s a big the reason why Royal Birkdale has produced so many classy winners. By country it reads five Americans - Arnold Palmer (1961), Lee Trevino (1971), Johnny Miller (1976), Tom Watson (1983) and Mark O'Meara (1998), three Australians - Peter Thomson (1954 & 1965) and Ian Baker-Finch (1991) and one Irishman - Padraig Harrington (2008). Every winner since the world rankings became a thing was a top 25 player; every winner before they existed would probably have been in the top 10.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

Jason Day is now the betting favorite to win his second major championship according to the recent Las Vegas betting line that came out on Monday. Day, the defending PGA Champion after his three-shot victory over Jordan Spieth at Whistling Straits last August, has had a solid 2016 season with three wins that include the Arnold Palmer Invitational, WGC-Dell Match Play and the Players Championship against a major-type field. According to Westgate LV Superbook, at 13-2, Day is a slight favorite over 2011 U.S. Open winner Rory McIlroy, who is at 7-1 and followed closely behind by Jordan Spieth at 15-2.
Jason Day  ->  positive

He finished 14th on debut here in 2012 after opening up with a 64 but he missed the cut in 2014 and again last year, so he's very much a chancy pick. Selections:  Chesson Hadley @ [110.0]  Scott Stallings [120.0]  Trey Mullinax @ [170.0] & 150/1 (Sportsbook)    I'll be back later with my European Tour previews. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

He is also a veteran on Tour who can win and score well almost any week and on any course so we’ll use that knowledge to our advantage to gain an edge picking the bargain plays. Player to Avoid:  Justin Rose $9,700 – DISCLAIMER! We know Justin is a world-class player and week in and week out should not be a fade.
Justin  ->  negative

Final card, E/W Henley 40/1 Bryson 66/1 Kim 70/1 Bryan 125/1 Shop around, those aren’t all the best numbers. Long… https://t.co/FBeLPhLDGD
Bryson  ->  positive

Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
@BrandenGrace  ->  positive

Selections    I've surprised myself and backed Adam Scott and I've taken a chance on four outsiders... I'm not convinced the venue's right for Smylie Kaufman but he's been catching the eye of late and he's one of few making his debut so I've had a small wager on him and I've also played Chris Kirk, D.A Points and John Huh. Kirk, who's a winner of the aforementioned RSM Classic, has played here only once before when he missed the cut in 2012 after a disastrous opening 78.
Kirk,  ->  positive

With 7 PGA Tour titles total in his first 4 seasons on the PGA Tour, Justin is undoubtedly a talented individual. To put Thomas' achievements in some form of context, Sergio Garcia has 10 PGA Tour titles to his name across a 16-year span. Others we see week in, week out at the top of the betting market include Justin Rose who has 8 PGA Tour titles, Hideki Matsuyama has 5 and Rickie Fowler has 4.
Thomas'  ->  positive

Bud Cauley is coming off two Top 10's in the fall and Webb Simpson is coming off his best finish(T4 at the Sony Open) since the Wyndham in August. All three will be popular this week and I will have a ton of exposure to Cauley and Reavie in cash games but feel there are some projected lower owned players in this range to help us separate ourselves in GPP formats. The first player I will be targeting is Chesson Hadley who I wrote up above.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Of the five Par-3’s two are 195 and 200 yards, and Hadley currently ranks 29th in Par-3 efficiency 175-200 yards. Now when it comes to the longer holes (200-225) Hadley is not as impressive, ranking 60th and averaging a touch over-par, but most will here this week anyway so that doesn’t put me off too much. Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past.
Hadley  ->  positive

Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
Reed  ->  positive

That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance." He's also among the game's elite scramblers.
Fowler  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70. Sounds a bit like TPC River Highlands, where he just won.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
Moore  ->  positive

1pt each-way Chez Reavie at 66/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) Well rested since, this is a great opportunity for Reavie to gain his second tour win. His last four tournaments have produced finishes of 48-4-16-43 and he was in the top-10 going into the final round of the Travelers.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Launch Angle – any time the wind can be a major factor, golfers that shoot low angle drives won’t be as impacted by the wind. The Golfers  Paul Casey ($8400) – Paul Casey has some a great mix of Off-The-Tee numbers that could help put him in great spots at Erin Hills, and has performed well at some of the comparison courses – a T30 and T10 at Whistling Straits, T7 at Royal Birkdale, and a T39 at Chambers Bay. He has the long and low drive that’s emblematic of English and South African golfers, which is so important to succeed at links courses, and he currently sits 15th in Good Drive percentage.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven’t guessed the name yet, I’m talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
Justin Thomas.  ->  negative

Tie that in with the aforementioned 5th at Harbour Town where he finished well in the worst of the Sunday conditions and Webb clearly has momentum. 21st here in 2011, 4th in 2012 and 2nd in 2015 on his home course, Simpson also finished a half-decent 33rd here at the PGA Championship after shooting a +5/76 to take himself right out of it on Thursday before producing -2/211 across his final 54 holes. All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays.
Webb  ->  positive

Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar. Pat Perez $7,600 – Can someone please tell us when Mr. Perez is going to get some DraftKings pricing credit for his play? The guy is on absolute fire recently with seven straight made cuts, including five top-25 finishes in that span.
Perez  ->  positive

This year he has been drawn in a group with his Ryder Cup buddy Jordan Spieth, Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel. As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through.
Reed  ->  positive

It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes. Over his past 24 events, Casey ranks first in SG:APP, SG: Par 4s, and 2nd in Bogey Avoidance. At $9,000 he is an extremely safe and reliable cash game cornerstone to build your lineup around.
Casey  ->  positive

If you make a tight tree-lined coastal course and then the winds whip up, rounds could get very ugly. The Top 10 Coastal Specialists:  Kelly Kraft (1.003 sg:coastal vs. 0.324 sg:total)  Patrick Rodgers (1.405 sg:coastal vs. 0.741 sg:total)  Rob Oppenheim (1.021 sg:coastal vs. 0.369 sg:total)  Martin Flores (1.357 sg:coastal vs. 0.727 sg:total)  John Daly (-0.867 sg:coastal vs. -1.426 sg:total)  Retief Goosen (1.228 sg:coastal vs. 0.705 sg:total)  Brendon Todd (0.516 sg:coastal vs. 0.115 sg:total)  Zac Blair (0.997 sg:coastal vs. 0.614 sg:total)  Brice Garnett (0.692 sg:coastal vs. 0.4 sg:total)  Fabian Gomez (0.686 sg:coastal vs. 0.425 sg:total)  Patrick Rodgers spent his college days at Stanford so perhaps that is where his love for coastal golf came to be. Kelly Kraft played at SMU, in windy Texas, which may tell us why he shines by the coast.
Retief  ->  positive

Poulter is among the elite in Shots Gained: Approach and Shots Gained: Scrambling this season which makes him a safe play and perfect for cash. Our VIP PGA Spreadsheet also shows that Poulter is gaining strokes on the field in Greens in Regulation, although it is great to have a good scrambler it is better if your players are hitting the greens in the first place and giving themselves birdie opportunities. I like Poulter for cash (especially on FanDuel) and think given his recent play he’s as close to a lock as we’ve got this week.
Poulter  ->  positive

I'm e/w on Rahm, Oosthuizen, Woodland &amp; Haas in WGC-MexicoChamp. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
Rahm,  ->  positive

McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts. We currently have Rory projected for 21-25 percent ownership in large-field guaranteed prize pools (GPPs), but I wouldn’t be shocked to see him break 30 percent in DraftKing’s Millionaire Maker.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Seven may have been enough picks but given how big the prices are on most of my original selections I'm going to bend the rules a little bit to get two more big outsiders in. Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

With the wind set to blow this week I am looking to stick with players who are proven in the wind or/and are renowned ‘ball strikers’ and Knox certainly ticks those boxes. Knox’s renowned ball striking strengths had dipped over the 2016/17 period but his 2018 stats show that he is back on track as he currently lies 38th in Driving Accuracy and 6th in GIR. All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.
Knox  ->  positive

When Kisner was second to Furyk here, he put on a ball-striking clinic and a similar display should see him go close once more, his focus no doubt fixed on atoning for Bay Hill and winning on what's home soil for the South Carolina man, who practices nearby at Kiawah Island. As for going win-only, again that's largely so he can share the load with Snedeker, but I'm a big believer in Kisner's ability to get it done. He just looks a winner and even last week at the Masters said, "I'm not out here to make cuts.
Kisner  ->  positive

A similar situation will likely occur this week as calm weather could see players approach the -25 Bubba Watson put up last season, while more wind will likely result in tamer scores. Last 5 winners  2015—Bubba Watson -25 (over Patrick Reed -22)  2014—Jordan Spieth -26 (over Henrik Stenson -16)  2013—Zach Johnson -13 (over Tiger Woods playoff)  2012—Graeme McDowell -17 (over Keegan Bradley -14)  2011—Tiger Woods -10 (over Zach Johnson -9)  Statistics  Driving Distance  Par 5 Scoring  This course is definitely a bit of an unknown in terms of how it will play, so I think being as simple as possible this week when looking at stats is a good idea. With the course set up as very wide open and pretty long Driving Distance will be a factor and would target those with length off the tee when possible.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Dufner-8100 way too much when Noren’s 7200  Molinari-8200 same reason as above. Names to know, or I had to look up-  Roberto Diaz ($6,500)- Playing his way via the highest ranked Mexican golfer in the world, Diaz has been tearing up the Web.Com tour this year posting a 4/4 record with 3 top 20’s. In a no cut event for the min price playing for the pride of his country, I like the narrative here.
Diaz  ->  positive

Obviously with Kenny on my man Roberto at 125/1. Good driver of the ball and led the field in GIR last week. 2 top… https://t.co/nT9HCVEKVs
Roberto  ->  positive

Brendan Steele, $9600 – A perfect history of 7-of-7 made cuts including three top-6 finishes at Scottsdale, Steele is a flat-out bargain in a top-weighted field this week. Call it intuition but given Steele’s recent trip to the winner’s circle last October, it would be no surprise to see him closely contend for victory this week. The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price.
Brendan Steele,  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($9,600): Won here in his 2010 debut so he could use this as a nice springboard to get back into contention. Charley Hoffman ($10,900): Remarkable SEVEN top 15s in eight starts here at TPC San Antonio. Abraham Ancer ($6,900): Has called Texas home for much of his life.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two. Click To Enlarge!
Thomas  ->  negative

I love him at this price. Gary Woodland ($8,400) – Despite his exceptional performances outside of one MC at Phoenix, Gary continues to get no love from either the field or DK’s pricing algorithm, and I expect much of the same this week. He’s got his tee-to-green game completely lined up, his putting is reasonably strong, and there’s no reason to believe he won’t consider his top-20 lock status this week even in this field.
Gary  ->  positive

But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor. If you are going to tell me Brown is likely going to be highly owned at $9,800 when there are numerous options priced above and below him that are in better form, I will gladly fade Brown.
Brown  ->  negative

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Travelers Championship - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Bubba Watson 1.5pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Bubba Watson makes a lot of sense this week and with Day, McIlroy and Spieth all in the field, it's great to see 33/1 about the 2-time Travelers champion. Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
Chappell  ->  positive

Finally Huh has some eye catching progressively improving form at Copperhead with finishes of 33rd, 22nd and then 9th over the past three years, which gives further cause for optimism of a good week ahead. DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 31st  The mention of Bozzelli above leads me on nicely to my last selection of the week. Regular readers will know that I was on Bozzelli a couple of weeks ago at the Honda at the massive odds of 350-1.
Bozzelli  ->  positive

His win at the Tour Championship, where he held off Player of the Year, Justin Thomas was especially impressive and whilst this season has not yet lived up to expectations, a slight lull in form had to be expected. Just one missed cut this season suggests that, despite a struggle to reach the heights of last year, Schauffele can still grind out results without bringing his best stuff and with top-9 finishes at both the CIMB Classic (3rd) and the Genesis Open (T9) on the PGA Tour, as well as a T2 finish at the Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan, he is clearly still capable of flashing brilliance week-to-week. This event will be right up Xander’s street, with his distance off the tee a huge weapon when looking to overcome the long par 4’s and 5’s here.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Still unfamiliar to most players in the field, Club de Golf Chapultepec should again provide a solid test and limit the winner to no lower than mid-teens under par despite the highly talented field. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Dustin Johnson  2016 – Adam Scott  2015 – Dustin Johnson  2014 – Patrick Reed  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Justin Rose  2011 – Nick Watney  2010 – Ernie Els  2009 – Phil Mickelson  2008 – Geoff Ogilvy    Key Stats to Winning this Week    • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green  • Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green  • Avg Proximity to the Hole    Champion’s Profile    With just one year of history of play on the PGA Tour, Club de Golf Chapultepec was a fan favorite in it’s first go last season. Taking a close look at 2017, DJ didn’t wow off the tee like he normally does, he simply kept the ball in play and made hay with his irons.
DJ  ->  positive

Reavie has been playing good golf as of late making seven straight cuts, all within the top 50 including two majors with finishes of T16 (US Open) and T22 (PGA Championship). Reavie’s success has been coming from his Approach game, where he has been gaining just under a stroke a round once field adjusted. I like Reavie’s affordable price tag and see the ownership low enough to be playable in GPP’s well the floor is high enough he makes a great cash game play.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

He is going to be popular(2nd most tagged on FanShare at this point) this week, especially on DraftKings under the $9K mark but makes a high upside play safe in all formats. Hideki Matsuyama  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,700)  FanDuel ($9,600)  Hideki has one more year of experience here at TPC Sawgrass but very similar form as Thomas and has also gotten better each year. Despite shooting no rounds under 70 in 2014, he was very consistent through four rounds and finished T23.
Hideki  ->  positive

This was his first major start and considering the huge strides he has made in the last decade there is every reason to expect a stronger challenge. Noren, who tied for ninth at Royal Lytham in 2012, should be capable of surpassing this in Southport and deserves support at 50/1 each way. Marc Leishman has already established an impressive record at the Open and the Australian looks well equipped to mount another challenge this weekend.
Noren,  ->  positive

I think the veteran has a good chance of making the cut, and at only $6,600, he is a nice GPP play that should come with a very low ownership this weekend. (5-8% via Fantasy Labs)  Matt Jones: (7,000) Jones is an inconsistent player, but he has been terrific here at Pebble Beach for his career, making 8/9 cuts with a T10 in 2010, a T15 in 2011, a T7 in 2015, and another T10 last season. He has had a decent start to this season making 2/4 cuts with a T36 last week at The Phoenix Open.
Matt Jones:  ->  positive

Byeong-hun An at 40/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - played well here for top-20 on debut; plenty of incentive to better it 1pt e.w. Ryan Palmer at 90/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - back-to-form top-10 last time; needs another big week to make Playoffs Click here for our transparent tipping record Henrik Stenson heads the betting for what looks a stock renewal of the Wyndham Championship, as many of the game's best take time out before the FedEx Cup Playoffs. Stenson is the chief exception and perhaps that's a nod to Sedgefield Country Club, the course which hosts this event for the 10th year in succession.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Cook won the RSM Classic, finished T18 at the Sony Open and also made the weekend at the Mayakoba (T50) after shooting an opening-round 66. All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley.
Cook’s  ->  positive

Granted, there's some guesswork required but at 80/1 he looks worth sticking with. Luke List: Ready to make his mark  One year older and with a similar enough profile, Gary Woodland is next on the list having been eased out despite playing perfectly well last week. Two bogey-free rounds at TPC Kuala Lumpur is some effort - while a low-scoring track, few players manage to avoid a hiccup over even 18 holes - and he closed out encouragingly to once again show that he's comfortable in Asia.
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

Again, I don't think we need to pay up at the top in cash games but he has a ton of upside and makes an excellent GPP play. Ryan Palmer  World Golf Ranking (#99)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($9,300)  It's been a long road for Palmer who not only had to deal with offseason surgery but personally had to deal with his wife's breast cancer diagnosis. He has been up and down in 2018 but has made three of fours cuts with the high being a T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
Palmer  ->  positive

He also ranked 30th in putting 4'-8' and 22nd in putting 15'-20'. With an emphasis on Par 4 scoring this week, Berger's rank of 14th last season should be very beneficial. He also ranked 46th in our top key stat this week: GIR.
Berger's  ->  positive

He missed the cut at the Career Builder Challenge but either side of that disappointing effort he's finished sixth in the Sony and 12th in Phoenix. Two-time Sony winner, Jimmy Walker's course form is similarly poor and his figures read 38-MC-40-43-67-43 but it's noticeable that he's back for more and if we dig a little deeper it makes sense. He sat second behind Rickie at halfway last year and in his previous visit, in 2012, he sat fifth at halfway.
Jimmy Walker's  ->  positive

Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
Chappell  ->  positive

He is going to be popular as he is currently the top tagged golfer on FanShare but with his distance and all-around game, he is a top play in all formats. Stewart Cink  World Golf Ranking (#156)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($6,900)  FanDuel ($7,200)    Dipping down into the sub $7K range, we find Stewart Cink who ranks quite high in my stats model this week. While his SG: OTT ranks outside the Top 50, he averages about 294 yards off the tee and ranks 4th overall on the sheet in SG: APP.
Stewart Cink  ->  positive

Jim Furyk – $9,100  This does not seem like Jim Furyk’s tournament to win, or even contend in. With all the bomber talk and Par 5 scoring requirements needed to compete, it’s shocking to see Furyk’s impressive course history. With that said, the Furyk we are seeing this year isn’t like years past.
Furyk  ->  negative

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.

Weather Forecast : The latest weather forecast for Atlanta, Georgia is here .
Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

What stands out is his recent performances on poa annua/bentgrass greens with a win and a third in Riviera and Pebble Beach so that could be a big box ticked here. Johnson could overpower this venue ranking second in driving distance, third in GIR, 31st in SGP, 12th in par 4 scoring and 16th in par 5 scoring. With excellent current form and a razor sharp game DJ looks like the man to beat here.
DJ  ->  positive

There is no doubt in my mind that if he can have even an average week on the greens with his long game he can get in to the hunt and at 60-1 for a top 7 place I am winning to take a gamble this happens. RYAN MOORE – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 28th  I’ll be finishing my Masters staking plan with three 3 figure priced players and I’ll start these with Ryan Moore. Moore frustrated me just a few weeks when having eulogised over him in my preview for the Valspar he promptly missed the cut, before duly popping up with a top 5 next time out at Bay Hill.
RYAN MOORE  ->  positive

Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well.
Henley  ->  positive

Of course he struggled over the weekend, shooting 74-72 to fall 24 places, however his play over the first two days here, after finishing T13 at the Honda Classic suggest he’s playing ok. PGA National is not a course you’d think would suit Pieters so that was a very promising result and whilst he disappointed at the Match Play last week, I think he can re-energise himself here. A T4 finish on debut at Augusta last year suggests Pieters could well like this test as well, and will be looking for confidence-building week as he returns to Augusta looking to emulate that success from 12 months ago. Even ahead of his debut at Augusta last year, Pieters’ form was up and down, finishing 2nd at the Genesis Open and 5th in Mexico either side of a MC at the Honda before also missing the weekend at Bay Hill.
Pieters  ->  positive

The $9,700 price tag means we can easily fit him into lineups without having to drop too deep in the $6K range. Thomas Pieters $7,300 – Pieters is one of our GPP favorites for DraftKings this week. He’s an absolute bomber that scores birdies and eagles at an extremely high rate.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

So make sure you are comfortable with the stands that you take. CASH: Hideki Matsuyama is the man again this week. His course history is elite, both before and after the renovation.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Danny Lee falls into the second category as a player that consistently shows form before his results. I felt given this form Lee provided cash game stability well simultaneously providing GPP upside. Lee’s performance provided both as his finished helped propel cash line-ups into the money and gave GPP lineups a solid shot at a higher payout.
Lee  ->  positive

Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring. Also Consider: Bill Haas, Adam Hadwin, Bud Cauley, Kevin Na  GPP Pivots  Grayson Murray ($6,800) – I am not a fan of Grayson off the course but since we are only worried about his life in the ropes lets get to it.
Finau  ->  positive

Par 4 Scoring has been really important here too. The first two home last year, Herman and Henrik Stenson, ranked tied second on the par fours, Holmes ranked number one for Par 4 Scoring two years ago and Spieth, who lost in the playoff, ranked second. In the last 11 years, since the event switched to this venue, ten of the 11 winners have ranked inside the top-10 for that stat and all 11 have ranked inside the top-10 for birdies made.
Holmes  ->  positive

Noren comes here in much better form this time around and could be a huge danger man here. Thomas Pieters 35/1  The big hitting Belgian is playing some decent golf lately and after a great performance here last year, Chapultepec looks like it could really suit his game. Pieters has had a mixed bag of form over the last few months but there has been some decent stand out performances.
Pieters  ->  positive

RESULT: T9  Kevin Na 0.75pt EW 70/1 with New customers: get up to £25 in free bets via this link, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  With form of 6(TPC Boston)-29(Glen Oaks)-4(Sedgefield), Kevin Na is playing some nice stuff and for an each-way cover bet he's ideal this week. Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required. An undoubted talent, Na might not trouble the winner's interviewer nearly enough, but at 64th in the OWGR and 40th in the FedEx Cup series, the Las Vegas man will be gunning for a top 5 finish this week to grab a coveted East Lake spot.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

At his low $7K price tag he is safe in all formats. Also Consider - Luke Donald  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Daniel Berger  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $6,900  FantasyAces - $4,900    A terrific stretch of golf that started back in March at the Cadillac Championship and saw Berger make 10 straight cuts and pick up his first career win at the St. Jude Classic. He was injured shortly after the win and was forced to withdraw from the Bridegestone Invitational which burnt a lot of people.
Berger  ->  positive

Still in the middle of his comeback after major back fusion surgery, Woods has looked like a potential winner in his recent TOUR stops. After opening 2018 with a T23 at the Farmers Insurance Open, Woods missed the cut at the Genesis Open, prompting many to suggest he needed more time to get back into the real swing of tournament action. But a 12th place finish at the Honda Classic was followed by a runner up effort at the Valspar Championship — keeping the hype alive and building.
Woods  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Brooks Koepka – $7,700  What in the world is going on with Brooks Koepka. He has played terrible in his last two events and has reverted to snapping drivers in half to help solve his problems.
Brooks Koepka  ->  negative

I’ll be on at 16s. The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail.
Rose  ->  positive

If you like longshots, you have to like Harrington’s history on this course. Branden Grace - One golfer who has been flying under the radar a bit is Branden Grace, who has back-to-back top-25 finishes and hasn’t missed the cut once in his last five events. Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

MY PICK : Alex Noren ($8,700)  Noren doesn’t necessarily have the easiest opening group (Tony Finau, Thomas Pieters, Kevin Na), but the Swede has been one of the world’s best players over the past few months and owns the experience angle over his competitors. Noren has an underrated match-play record, having reached the semifinal of the Paul Laurie Match Play event in Europe in 2016 — winning five matches in a row to achieve that feat. He went 3-0 in his Austin pod last year and gave eventual winner Dustin Johnson a good run before losing out to him.
Noren  ->  positive

Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
@K_Kisner  ->  positive

And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total. Roster the veteran in this weak field event.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Gotta give an some extra time looking into Bozzelli (55/1) and Spaun (45/1). I'm intrigued. Oh, if you want List at 33/1, get him now.
List  ->  positive

Aggressive (3rd in Going for the Green) and potent on the par-5s (2nd in par-5 Birdie or Better), Koepka won at Erin Hills which played pretty-much to a PGA Championship format back in June. 5th at Whistling Straits in 2015 and 4th at Baltusrol last year summarise perfectly that Koepka's power-packed game is ideal for the PGA of America's premier title. What really sells his chances to me this week though are a few results on his CV that jump from off the page and his red-hot putter of late.
Koepka  ->  positive

He was in contention last week at Kapalua before finishing tied for ninth, where he also had a top-10 a year ago. Michael Collins: Spieth ($11,500)  Seeing as he's never played the Sony Open before, the term "ignorance is bliss" comes to mind. This type of course is completely opposite to what he played last week at Kapalua.
Spieth  ->  positive

All six golfers in the upper tier are close in overall tags so it will be important to pay close attention as lineup lock approaches to help decide which golfers will be the most owned and which make the best GPP plays. $8K - $9K Range  Tony Finau currently leads all golfers in all ranges in total tags and start recommendations so I fully expect him to be one of the Top 3 highest owned plays this week. I talked about him above and won't let ownership sway me from using him.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

At only $7,200 this week on DraftKings and $7,900 on FanDuel, we are getting a great deal of value and hoping to get him at lower ownership in GPPs. -- Jeff Bergerson  Phil Mickelson  On a course where scrambling and second shots matter, Phil is priced far too cheaply for his upside; it's a given that he'll end up in some odd spots off the tee from week to week, but Lefty is consistently one of the best around the greens and has been throughout his career. Mickelson has struggled to get through four full rounds this year, whether it's from mental lapses or physical exhaustion (he's old), so that will be a concern -- but he's also excellent in approach shots, an elite putter who puts up a ton of daily fantasy points with his great birdie average, and he's near the top in scoring on par 5s.
Phil  ->  positive

Almost certain to have numerous birdie chances, he is one for whom the weekend will come and they drop. Having backed Jason Dufner for this in 2016 after watching his warm-up at the Sony, I am struggling to leave him out after a similar display last week. Yes, he was a bigger price but the horse hasn’t bolted after he ran up an impressive putting stat off an unusually average approach game and must be inspired returning to the venue of the victory over David Lingmerth in a memorable play-off here two years ago..
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

9. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar went to Georgia Tech and he plays pretty well in this college hometown event. However, his form has slipped in the playoffs.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

With that being said, lets talk about some picks. Previous 5 Winners:  2016: Rory McIlroy (-12)  2015: Jordan Spieth (-9)  2014: Billy Horschel (-11)  2013: Henrik Stenson (-13)  2012: Brandt Snedeker (-10)  NOTE: ONLY ONE PREVIOUS WINNERS IS IN THE FIELD (Jordan Spieth 2015)  KEY STATS FOR THIS WEEK:  SG Tee-Green SG Putting Birdie or Better Bogey Avoidance Par 4 Scoring GIR  – DFS PGA Plays of the Week –  Jordan Spieth ($11,600)  This weeks core will consist of just three names. Why am I doing that?
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

While it will be his first visit to TPC Scottsdale, Noren does have the advantage of having played some desert-style courses before on the Euro Tour, which should be comparable in style. Despite only winning once last year, Noren is a golfer with good win equity as well, as he’s recorded five wins worldwide over the past 19 months and is a proven competitor when in the mix. Even though he’s $1,500 more expensive this week than last, his recent form and record over the last couple of years make him a solid play in the $9K range, where his overall career record outclasses those who surround him in price.
Noren  ->  positive

The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail. The Olympic champion has returned from the back injury that dogged him at the back end of last season in decent form.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

WilliamHill 6 places 1/5 odds) 2pts e/w:  Jordan Spieth has not had his best season so far, but the fact we are saying that is a testament to the lofty expectations placed on him by both us and himself. Before winning at Pebble Beach in February, Spieth started the season T3-3-T9, but it his play since that has raised question marks. He has missed three cuts in the nine events since his win and also failed to make it out of his group at the WGC Match Play.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week. Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event. It wasn’t to be for Rose that week though as he limped to a disappointing 48th place finish, much below his usual high standards.
Rose  ->  positive

The Swede is looking for his first victory since winning The Open last summer. Taras Pitra: Kevin Kisner ($7,600)  When looking at Kisner's stats, it's amazing to me that he hasn't won yet. What's even more surprising to me is how he has managed only two top-10s in five events.
Kisner  ->  positive

Others: Luke List  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, JB Holmes, Patrick Cantlay, Gary Woodland, Kevin Tway, Ollie Schniederjans, Ricky Werenski  – Bubba Watson, Anirban Lahiri, Scott Stallings, Luke List, Robert Garrigus, Chad Campbell  Bets:  JB Holmes 45-1  Scott Stallings 80-1  Anirban Lahiri 80-1 EW  Kevin Tway 75-1 EW  Luke List 200-1 EW He was top five in both SG: Off the Tee and Approaches at the Barbasol, and with 41 birdies and three eagles over his last two starts is a great tournament target this week. Scott Stallings ($7,500): Stallings has been playing out of his mind the past two weeks and given that Glen Abbey lines up nicely—in terms of ease of setup—with the venues at his past two starts we probably shouldn’t look past the three-time Tour winner in DFS.
Matt Kuchar,  ->  positive

Reavie finished last season strong with six straight top 25’s and has shown decent course history with three straight made cuts including a top 10 last season. The course fits Reavie’s game as his lack of distance off of the tee won’t hurt him as much as it would on other layouts. According to our Research Station, Reavie is number 1 in field adjusted driving accuracy of any player priced over $9000 on FanDuel.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

On top of his excellent putting stats, Harman ranks 19th in both Scrambling and Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green which I feel are important this week. Harman also ranks 11th in Par 4 Scoring Average and T24 in Par 4 Performance, again impressive statistics ahead of this week. On top of this all Harman finished T5 at this event at Bethpage Black in 2012 and impressed again four years later, finishing T22 at the same course and event.
Harman  ->  positive

In summary, it’s not a difficult course tee-to-green and that relieves the pressure from his long game. Twelve months ago, Spieth won by 8 shots despite gaining just 0.3 strokes per round on the field with his putting. To win by that margin with only an average putting display (by his standards) bodes well.
Spieth  ->  positive

Statistically Fowler ranks 49th in Strokes Gained Off-The-Tee and 14th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green which are two of the key areas this week. Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season.
Fowler  ->  positive

People will be hesitant to play Spieth, despite being the third highest priced player, because of his poor recent form and with Augusta looming right around the corner. There is no doubt Spieth needs a huge week to gain momentum for the next week to throw his name in the ring as the betting favorites alongside Tiger and Rory. This is the last week he has to make a splash, and no one would be shocked if in two weeks time, Spieth has won back-to-back events.
Spieth,  ->  positive

It may be a week where you don’t need to take anyone in this range but if you do, there are a few to choose from. Ryan Blaum has taken to life on the PGA Tour well, finishing T26 and T11 in his first two events this season. He also finished T29 at the OHL Mayakoba Classic last year.
Ryan Blaum  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth is the defending champion at this week’s Dean & DeLuca Invitational. Can he make it back-to-back wins in Fort Worth? The Dean & DeLuca Invitational, an event that’s sponsored by a New York-founded chain of upscale grocery stores but held in the heart of Texas, starts an interesting little run of tournaments leading to the PGA TOUR‘s second major of the season.

Right now, it's hard to see an early or late advantage.

You will see me reference these in my articles and videos. Top Course History Targets  Bubba Watson  World Golf Ranking (#40)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,500)  Over the course of one's career, no one has dominated TPC River Highlands quite like Bubba. He missed the cut here in his first trip back in 2006, skipped the 2007 event and has not only made the cut in nine straight years since but has won twice('10/'15) with five total Top 10 finishes.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Johnson has finished inside the top-23 in six of his seven starts this season, with the T57 finish at the Phoenix Open the exception. This suggests Johnson’s game is in very good shape, and an improvement in one area could be the difference on any given week. Zach has always been known for his short-game and in particular his putting, but so far this season he currently ranks just 81st in Strokes Gained: Putting, and should he find his touch on the greens, a win could be on the horizon.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

QED! Exchange Betting  My pre-tournament strategy for this year is more or less unchanged and I’ve layed the following players:  All players priced 50/1 or shorter, with the exception of: Rose, Spieth, Bubba & Garcia;  All course rookies (eg Schauffele, Frittelli, Finau, Li);  All Augusta non-performers (eg Noren, Reed, Kaymer, Fleetwood, Hatton) and;  Most players with two or more missed cuts this year (eg Fowler, Poulter, Oosthuizen, DeChambeau, Kisner). Finally, if you like a bit of back-to-lay exchange action, my top two to poke their noses onto the leaderboard at some stage are:  Brendan Steele (330.00) who was 27th in his second Augusta start last year and who hasn’t missed a cut since August and;  Kiradech Aphibarnrat (160.00) who was 15th in his only Augusta start (2016) and who has been playing well in top company this year (5th WGC Mexico & quarter-finalist WGC Dell Matchplay.
Spieth,  ->  positive

The win still eludes him but his high-class consistency is appealing to fantasy managers. Tyrrell Hatton  Hatton was in the middle of a golden spell last year when a T10 here was the Mexican filling sandwiched between Florida T4s at the Honda and Bay Hill. He missed the cut at PGA National last week but prior to that was third in Abu Dhabi (3rd GIR) and let’s remember that he’s the World No.
Hatton  ->  negative

A T39 finish last week then looks extremely positive under the circumstances and he will be pleased to get through four rounds to start off 2018. Bozzelli is a natural winner, winning four times in in 2014 on the NGA (Hooters) Tour and winning Rookie and Player of the Year honours that season. In the same year he played four times on the Web.com Tour, finishing in the top-10 twice.
Bozzelli  ->  positive

Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse. Looking at my sheet, there are only two other golfers in the $7,500+ range who have scored less DraftKings points per tournament(41) than Rahm.
Rahm  ->  negative

Maybe he is looking for some guidance this week, whatever it is, I really do believe Horschel can bounce back from the missed cut last week, with a huge week here at Bay Hill. Brooks Koepka 100/1 (StanJames 6 places + Betway, William Hill and Ladbrokes) 0.5pt e/w:  From one golfer who needs some help to another, I also think Brooks Koepka is worth a bet at the same price as Horschel. Koepka has been in dismal form in 2017, finishing no better than his T42 at the Phoenix Open so far, so why am I backing him this week?
Koepka  ->  positive

I'm e/w on List, Lovemark &amp; Kaufman in Las Vegas this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips #golf
Kaufman  ->  positive

Fact is though that the freshly extended 7,297 yard (up 81 yards from 2014 and 55 yards from 2015) par 71 - which is an original Arnold Palmer design - yields birdies, but only for those who are aggressive and on their game. Winning totals of -15 (Fowler 2015), -15 (Kirk 2014), -22 (Stenson 2013), -20 (McIlroy 2012), -15 (Simpson 2011), -22 (Hoffman), -19 (Stricker), -22 (Singh) and -16 (Mickelson) across the past 9 renewals show that the pure Bentgrass greens can yield plenty of birdies. Scoring tends to be dictated by the firmness of the greens, so with a relatively dry August and another lengthening of course yardage, we should expect around the same level of scoring as we have seen in the past 2 years.
(Mickelson)  ->  positive

Right now, he only has 15 tags on FanShareSports, the fewest of any golfer priced above $9,500. In the past five Bridgestone Invitationals, Rose leads the entire field in total strokes gained. He has three top 5s in the past five years at Firestone.
Rose  ->  positive

Harman wasn’t great last week at the Genesis Open, but he does have five top-25 finishes in 10 events and has made the cut seven times. Harman has produced four of those top-25 finishes in his last five events overall. Also, Harman shot a 61 in the second round of the 2012 Honda Classic, which is a course record, so he does have some history on this course and a great feel for things.
Harman  ->  positive

Last year DJ beat Rahm in the final match to take the trophy. Other winners include Jason Day (2016 and 2014), Rory (2015), Kuchar (2013) and Ian Poulter (2010). I’m not harping too much on the course because this is match play.
Ian Poulter  ->  positive

Henry is fully exempt this season by virtue of the last spot via the FedExCup points list in 2016-17.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Rickie Fowler $10,500 – Fowler is the one guy out of the top four on DraftKings we just can’t roster. You can make great cases for the other three up top (all previous winners here), but Fowler’s inability to close in strong fields like this is concerning. We mentioned that you have to roster the winner this week.
Fowler  ->  negative

In 2017 he ranked 15th in par-four scoring, 17th in three-putt avoidance and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green. Pat Perez - $14,500    Much like Leishman, Perez is another veteran coming off a career year in 2017 after winning the CIMB Classic to go along with six total top-10s. The 41-year-old finished T3 at this past year’s Tournament of Champions, while he’s posted no finish worse than a T34 in his last nine starts.
Leishman,  ->  positive

Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win. He has made six straight cuts with five Top 25 finishes including a T5 last week at the Travelers Championship.
Reed  ->  positive

His form figures here read 43-73-2-31-14 and he caught the eye last week when a fast finishing 11th. Selections:  Jason Day @ [26.0]  Jhonattan Vegas [70.0]  Charley Hoffman @ [75.0]  Harris English @ [110.0]    I'm taking a bit of time off this weekend so Paul Krishnamurty is going to cover the In-Play Blog and De-brief and I'll be back with the previews again next week. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Jhonattan Vegas  ->  positive

They were paired together in one of the two pairs matches and won 3&2. Henley is having an excellent season and his last three starts show a win at the Houston Open, T11 at the Masters and T26 in The Heritage. He played the weather-shortened 2016 Zurich Classic and shot 69-73-68 for T36.
Henley  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Kyle Stanley; 2) Ryan Armour / Russell Henley / Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Chez Reavie; 7) Jordan Spieth; 8) Colt Knost / William McGirt; 10) Kevin Na; 11) Austin Cook; 12) Ben Martin; 13) Steve Wheatcroft; 14) Kevin Kisner; 15) Justin Thomas; 16) Tyler Duncan / J.J.

Marc Leishman;  ->  positive

He finished T4 and T6 in his two most recent trips to Augusta National. Vegas Odds  As you see, Johnson has been excellent with double-digit odds to win. Of the 18 tournaments with at least 10 percent odds, DJ posted 100 DraftKings points or more in eight.
DJ  ->  positive

As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
Reed  ->  positive

He’s one of the best ball strikers on tour as he’s currently 14th in Greens in Regulation. Honorable Mention: Adam Scott ($8,500) & Francesco Molinari ($7,300)  Could Sergio Garcia prove to be this weekend’s top option? Read Now  Going Against The Green  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Around the Green  Scrambling  Par 5 Birdie or Better  An argument can be made that either Jon Rahm ($11,400) or Rickie Fowler ($9,200) has been the second-best golfer this season, behind Dustin Johnson.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago. A 4-time PGA Tour winner, Kirk won his first ever title on the Nicklaus-designed Annandale track in 2011 shooting -22/266 and Chris in many ways reminds me of a Jason Dufner-sort, i.e. an experienced PGA Tour winner who slowly but surely is coming back from a barren time.
Chris  ->  positive

Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course. It's no wonder he has a stellar track record in major championships.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist. That's a potent combination for The Players Championship and Kisner seems the sort who could win this at a bulky price. 2nd at the Dell Matchplay in April, 2017 saw Kevin finish 3rd at the Tour Championship, lead the PGA Championship for 63 holes before finishing 7th, win the Invitational-status Dean & DeLuca Invitational at Colonial and finish 2nd at the Arnold Palmer invitational at Bay Hill.
Kevin  ->  positive

If he can just roll it at an average pace, like he did at this track last year, the reigning Masters champ will be near the top of the leaderboard. Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly.
Finau  ->  positive

If there's one guy who could be called the horse for this course, it would be Sergio Garcia.. -- Michael Collins  Rickie Fowler  In 2015, Fowler played world-class golf down the closing stretch at TPC Sawgrass to win the Players Championship and plant his flag in the fairway as a world class player, following the "overrated" narrative that started in the media. Now a year removed from the hype of repeating, Fowler has the game to win again at the newly renovated course. He has four top-10s already this year, was in contention at the Masters until falling off on Sunday, and leads the PGA Tour in adjusted scoring average.
Fowler  ->  positive

One thing for sure is that Olesen will be desperate to make the European Ryder Cup team, as his compatriot Bjorn is the captain this time around. Given the strength in depth for Team Europe, Olesen would have to do something dramatic to make the team, without being accused of getting preferential treatment from his fellow Dane. A win at this event would be a springboard in the right direction and will certainly peak Bjorn’s interest.
Olesen  ->  positive

Choi    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth, $19,800    It’s clear Spieth and Justin Thomas are the cream of this week’s crop, but Spieth comes with a higher salary due to his strong finish last week at Kapalua. Spieth possesses all the course management and iron game necessary to slay this course, and with a third-place effort last season, he’ll be hungry for more this time around. Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G. That being said, Murray is one of the best in the field this week with his mid-to-long irons and should be able to find the green in scoring position relatively easily. Although his putting numbers also don’t reflect well (154th), Murray still averages only 1.74 putts per hole which is T31, and his one-putt percentage of 40.7% is T50th.
Murray  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
Bryson DeChambeau  ->  positive

Whilst he finished 11th at Phoenix the week before this event last year, he had just missed the cut at Torrey Pines. This time he has been much more consistent, finishing T14 at Torrey before his T16 last week, so I am full of confidence once again, that Mickelson can get his first win since the 2013 Open Championship. Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events. He’s a great value buy.
Robert Garrigus  ->  positive

Check the bottom of the PGATour Launch Angle statistics. The Golfers  The Core  Ollie Schniederjans ($7700): The aforementioned Ollie Schniederjans, he of the low launch angle and ball height, makes a great play this week for many reasons beyond his play in the wind – he’s had good finishes this season at both RBC Heritage (T3) and the Valero Texas Open (T18) which are good comparable courses, and is coming in off four straight made cuts. Ollie sits 21st in Strokes Gained: Approach, and is excellent at getting close to the pin from both the fairway (14th) and the rough (17th); prox from the rough will have an impact this week given how tight the fairways are.
Ollie  ->  positive

This week he heads back to Mexico City where he gained 8 strokes on approach last year. Him and    Pat Perez  In the same mold as      Ranking the Field Imploded last week to miss the cut at the Honda. After the event, he was trying to hold back from talking about the conditions of the greens but you could tell he wasn't a fan.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Adam Scott; 4) Phil Mickelson; 5) Emiliano Grillo; 6) Rory McIlroy; 7) Jason Kokrak / Ryan Palmer; 9) Kevin Na; 10) Jhonattan Vegas / Bubba Watson; 12) Jerry Kelly / Russell Knox; 14) Martin Laird / Webb Simpson; 16) Jordan Spieth / Charl Schwartzel; 18) Jason Day / Jason Dufner; 20) Chad Campbell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Kevin Kisner; 2) Jason Day / Patrick Reed; 4) Brooks Koepka; 5) Brandt Snedeker / Bubba Watson; 7) Vijay Singh; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Zach Johnson / Kevin Na; 11) Kevin Chappell / David Lingmerth / Phil Mickelson; 14) Billy Hurley III; 15) Daniel Berger / Scott Brown / Ryan Palmer / Charl Schwartzel; 19) Si Woo Kim / Russell Knox. Winners & Prices : 2015: Fowler 40/1 ; 2014: Kirk 150/1 ; 2013: Stenson 28/1 ; 2012: McIlroy 12/1 ; 2011: Simpson 35/1 ; 2010: Hoffman 125/1 ; 2009: Stricker 22/1 .
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

This week’s OWGR chart has some very interesting standouts this week, one of whom is Wesley Bryan who’s official world golf ranking is 40th in the world despite his sub $7k price tag. Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place. At some point I expect Wes Bryan to bounce back, and why not this week on a course that plays to Bryan’s strengths?
Wesley Bryan  ->  positive

Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price.
Leishman  ->  positive

Deal with it. *  Bill Haas & James Hahn – Haas has two T10s in five career starts, with four straight finishes inside the T25 overall entering play… HHHAAAAAHHHHNNNNNNNNN’s upside will be dictated by his putter. Much like we said about Kyle Stanley all season.
Haas  ->  positive

There are six Par-4’s between 450-500 yards here at Riviera, and with Reavie averaging 290 yards off the tee this season, his approaches from 150-175 and 175-200 yards this week will be important. Reavie ranks 7th and 9th in approaches from the fairway in these two ranges respectively, further supporting his case this week. Whilst there are obvious question marks about whether Reavie can win, especially in this company, his game is in perfect shape to play this course.
Reavie  ->  positive

That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine. With a best of tied 4th at the Texas Open this season, it’s been a disappointing campaign but there have been signs in the last couple of weeks that Horschel may finally be springing into life. He followed up a tied-5th showing at the Wyndham Championship with another top 20 at The Barclays on the fiendishly difficult Bethpage Black.
Horschel  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
Tommy  ->  positive

7. Rickie Fowler -- Fowler was a third-place finisher here last year, and he's coming off a good effort with Jimmy Walker in the World Cup. T-6 in his last solo start at the WGC-HSBC Champions.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Fitzpatrick is first out on the 10th tee on Thursday, playing with Brandon Harkins and former winner of this event, Robert Gamez so he will get the best of the greens, making him an intriguing option as First Round Leader, an honour he shared with Emiliano Grillo last season. Tom Jacobs – Sam Horsfield to finish inside the top-20 (8/1)  Still just 21, it feels like Sam Horsfield’s name has been bounded around forever but that is because Ian Poulter has been gushing about the young Englishman’s ability for years. Horsfield was born in England but raised in Orlando, near Poulter’s home and educated at the University of Florida, so this is still somewhat of a home event for a man who has been plying his trade on the European Tour this season.
Sam Horsfield  ->  positive

Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned.
Spieth  ->  positive

CareerBuilder Challenge picks: Winner: The Chezsticle (Reavie) Top 10: Spaun, Mickelson, Howell DK Sleepers: Na, Laird, Power OAD: Reavie
Power  ->  positive

5. Bill Haas - Haas was outclassed in Mexico, but he's otherwise been great this season. This is a good track for him, and he should have won here last year.
Haas  ->  positive

As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact. Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out!
Glover’s  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy - $11,800 (7-1)    One way for Spieth to relieve some of that pressure was to say that McIlroy is the favorite. That's smart of Spieth, and calculating, but also probably true. McIlroy has won at Quail Hollow twice with six top-10s in seven career starts there.
Spieth  ->  positive

Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He also finished T5 at the Sanderson Farms Championship so there are plenty of positives if you go far enough back. 1pt each-way Xander Schauffele at 150/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds)  For my final selection, I’m going with another Web.com Tour graduate in the shape of JJ Spaun. The 26-year-old has been much more prominent on the PGA Tour this season.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Although the Tour is leaving many of the stars of last weekend in Las Vegas a few big names have made the trip down. Rickie Fowler will be making his season debut and is headlining the field and is joined by Patrick Reed, Charley Hoffman, Gary Woodland, Pat Perez and Zach Johnson. The event takes place at El Camaleon Golf Club, a par 71 measuring 7,031 yards.
Gary Woodland,  ->  positive

Also Consider - Harold Varner III  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Trey Mullinax  Vegas Odds - 200/1  Draftkings - $6,500  FantasyAces - $4,000    I love taking a rookie in this spot as he will most likely be extremely low owned. Oh ya and Mullinax has a tremendous amount of talent and through watching interviews, seems to have it together between the ears. PGA Tour pro Michael Thompson, who had the same college coach, went as far as to say Mullinax's raw power is best compared to Dustin Johnson.
Mullinax  ->  positive

His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first-round withdraws to his history, he hasn't missed the cut here going back to 2008. -- Adam Daly  Patrick Cantlay  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I am going to keep going back to Cantlay until his price rises to the point to where I have a decision to consider. At $7,800 on DraftKings, below the average salary, this is still an easy plug-and-play pick in the lower range for a player who has yet to miss a cut on the season, has shown elite ball striking ability and is not bad with the flat stick.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
Dufner  ->  positive

He also co-led in fairways hit and ranked T9 in greens in regulation and seventh in proximity to the hole. Chez Reavie … No shift in this narrative, really. He's 7-for-8 since New Orleans with a T4 in Memphis and a T16 at the U.S. Open.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

That’s strange behavior from someone who hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in Strokes Gained: Putting in each of the last two years (12th in 2016; 18th in 2017). Normally with Hadwin, it’s “I really hope his tee-to-green game can catch up to his putting.” Now, it’s the inverse. His lack of distance is worrisome, but he notched a T36 in his Augusta debut last year, and with some experience on these greens, plus an excellent track record at equally as lengthy Riviera (Hadwin gained the eighth-most strokes of any player in this field at the Genesis Open), pencil in Hadwin for the low, low price of $7,200 on DraftKings.
Hadwin,  ->  positive

Seven may have been enough picks but given how big the prices are on most of my original selections I'm going to bend the rules a little bit to get two more big outsiders in. Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

Kirk won this event in 2013 and has an average finishing position of 7.6 in his last three starts at this tournament. Kirk is in excellent form and has extremely good recent results at this track. He’s in play for all formats.
Kirk  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

That strong Sunshine State form spills over to other venues throughout the course of his career. The WGC at Doral has seen McDowell finish 6th (2010), 3rd (2013) and 9th (2014). Go back 13 years to 2005 and Graeme's breakout PGA Tour performance came at Bay Hill where he finished 2nd to Kenny Perry.
Graeme's  ->  positive

Salary Vs. Vegas Odds  While I don’t suggest making decision based purely on Vegas Odds when it comes to golf, I think it’s a useful way to determine where you might find golfers with unexpected value. The first standout this week comes in the form of Lucas Glover who’s odds are roughly 100:1 to win despite the fact that Glover will cost you only $6,600 towards the salary cap to get him in your lineups. Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play.
Glover  ->  positive

Masters 🔥 takes: Winner: Rory Top 10: Rose, Casey, 🍔, Leishman Sleepers: Pieters, Kisner, Molinari
Leishman  ->  positive

Julian Suri  When Suri came to the States at Torrey Pines, the “pay way too much attention to golf” crowd was properly excited. An American bomber, playing primary on the European Tour, people just assumed Suri was Brooks Koepka 2.0. Hasn’t really panned out that way.
Suri  ->  positive

After three great rounds last week in route to a seventh-place finish, Leishman is primed for success on a course where he’s a perfect 8-for-8 in made cuts. Brian Harman, $11,300 – Despite a huge increase in salary compared to last week, Harman still shakes out as a good value on a course tailor made for his game. Harman has finished no worse than T20 in the past three years, so expect the lefty precision player to convert plenty of birdies and continue his good form.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley 80/1 (Skybet 7 places 1/5, SportingBet 5 places 1/4) 1pt e/w:  Much like Reavie, Bradley is a great statistical fit for the event, what’s more, he has course form to boot. In seven starts at Riviera, Bradley has as many top-4 finishes as he does missed cuts (2), and also has two other top-20 finishes to add to the collection. Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup.

Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
Spieth  ->  positive

Put it all together and lineups that are heavy on the chalk (raising my hand) are not as likely to contend for the weekly title as gamers who blend surprise contenders with strong games off the tee. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Waste Management Phoenix Open (in alphabetical order):  Tony Finau  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  Webb Simpson  Jordan Spieth  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Zach Johnson; Marc Leishman; Phil Mickelson; Alex Noren; Cameron Smith; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Keegan Bradley; Emiliano Grillo; Alex Noren; Ryan Palmer; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas; Gary Woodland  Approach: Keegan Bradley; Zach Johnson; Patton Kizzire; Matt Kuchar; Alex Noren; Ryan Palmer; Brian Stuard  Short: Harris English; Adam Hadwin; J.B. Holmes; Zach Johnson; Patton Kizzire; Phil Mickelson; Patrick Reed; Gary Woodland  Power Rankings Wild Card  Harris English … He's poised to pay off draft leaguers invested in the rebound.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

-- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor. He has three top-25 finishes in his past five events played and finished T-32 last week at the Shriners.
Nick Taylor  ->  positive

He's 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National with four top-10s. Donald had missed three straight cuts until a T37 last week at Riviera, another track where birdies are scarce. John Huh - $7,100 (125-1)  Huh has already teed it up 10 times this season.
Donald  ->  positive

Henley gets it done in most of our key stats, ranking 13th in BA, 24th in BoB%, 13th in Par 4 Scoring, and 14th in Par 3 Scoring. If there was a course made to fit Henley's game, it would be this one. Henley also ranks 8th in putting 15-25' and 2nd in Round 1 Scoring.
Henley's  ->  positive

The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
Tiger  ->  positive

With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua. He can go lights out on and around the greens which is often crucial on a coastal course.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The winner in the desert in both 2010 and 2015, he obviously not only knows his way around these courses, but even as a quick player owns the patience necessary to play his best golf in the midst of a pro-am format. Jonathan Coachman: Kevin Kisner ($8,900)  Coming back on the mainland really makes the season feel like it is starting, unless you are Justin Thomas, who has already essentially qualified for the Tour Championship. Players seem motivated to step up their game.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips. He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events.
Campbell  ->  positive

On his promotion to the PGA Tour this autumn, Spaun acclimatised slowly to the higher level, but his best result by far came at El Camaleon where he finished 28th and he showed his liking for Paspalum greens by topping the Putts per GIR category that week. Harold Varner III 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  There's a massive difference of opinion over Harold Varner III this week with Paddy Power and Betfair pricing him as short as 35/1. The very early 80/1 in the market has rightfully been snapped up, but with the price history of this event 66/1 with HV3 is not a bad place to be this week.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

Jason Day loves this course and it really shows in his results as he’s landed finishes of 2nd, 3rd, 11th, 7th and 12th here in his last 6 visits. Day has been a birdie or better machine at this course over his career and is a great course horse this week. Sean O’Hair is an interesting addition to this list coming off his great week at the Barclays.
Day  ->  positive

PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Sentry Tournament of Champions (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jordan Spieth  Justin Thomas    You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Patrick Cantlay; Brooks Koepka; Jon Rahm; Cameron Smith  Driving: Patrick Cantlay; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley; Brendan Steele  Approach: Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley  Short: Brian Harman; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Brooks Koepka; Pat Perez    Power Rankings Wild Card  16. Cameron Smith … First-timer comin' in hot.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

All signs point to Cantlay being a great play on this course if the conditions are as good as predicted. However, if conditions deteriorate, I could see Cantlay struggling a bit on the small greens. Pat Perez ($8.6K) – Pat Perez just seems to love these shorter coastal tracks, almost like an American version of GMAC with a mullet.
Cantlay  ->  positive

The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Sometimes you don't have to be long to dominate Par 5s. Johnson is well above average with his irons, ranking 41st in approaches from 125-150 yards last year and 63rd from 150-175 yards. With higher elevated greens this week, scrambling will be a key stat; Johnson ranked 25th in 2016.
Johnson  ->  positive

The standouts on this chart are a bit less obvious this week which is interesting considering the pricing seems to have been adjusted a bit and is much less soft than we’ve seen over the past month or so. This week however, there seems to be some potential value in Brooks Koekpa, Danny Willett, and Soren Kjeldsen, all of whom find themselves seriously underpriced given their world rankings. Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR.
Soren Kjeldsen,  ->  positive

Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and has a 10th and 4th in his past 5 visits. Jason Dufner has a fantastic record at TPC Boston. Since 2009 Dufner has yet to miss the cut at this event in 6 visits and also has a 2nd and a 9th place finish to his name here.
Dufner  ->  positive

He has gained strokes on approach shots in six of his last seven events. There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it.
Reed  ->  positive

He’s clearly the best value amoung the top three players on DK and the stud worth owning to me. Paul Casey ($10,200): I feel like I am beating the drum week after week here with Casey but he really has been excellent over his past few starts. Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Marc Leishman is a Torrey Pines specialist who as we know is in cracking form right now. Talk of coastal golf, Kikuyugrass fairways and tough, technical scoring conditions on the South Course shouts Leishman from the rooftops and he certainly has the tools at his disposal to make a serious challenge this week, with no attention on him whatsoever. A tournament average score of 70.75 is only beaten by Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker and Charles Howell III amongst tournament regulars.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event. This time around, he’s up to a career-best 11th in the OWGR and has finished top-six five times in his last six starts.
Johnson  ->  positive

Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
Walker  ->  positive

He’s 23rd in the key 150-175 yard range though which will be a key range this week, and it makes it easy to ignore his overall Greens in Regulation number of 65.28% (109th). With a severe lack of distance off the tee, Poulter’s overall OTT numbers don’t seem appealing (142nd in SG: OTT, 168th in Distance), but Poulter is very accurate (64.03% of fairways hit). If Poulter struggles on approach, he’s currently 11th in Scrambling and 3rd in SG: Around the Green overall – with a cut line below E, Bogey Avoidance will be more important than normal, and Scrambling (as shown above) plays a huge part in avoiding squares.
Poulter’s  ->  positive

Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Fire him up at $7,000.
Castro:  ->  positive

Casey finished 16th in the WGC Mexico Championship and he placed 11th in this year’s Honda Championship played at Fazio-designed PGA National. Casey is rarely going to make the most birdies in the field for a week, but what he will do is prevent disaster as he ranks 14th in bogey avoidance. He has a great tee-to-green game, ranking 16th on tour, and also ranks 21st in SG:App.
Casey  ->  positive

He has averaged 17.0 birdies per tournament over his last three events, which is quite a bump up from his long-term mark of 13.6. Finau is an especially intriguing player given his length off the tee: He’s averaging a DD of 309.7 yards over the past year. He’s posted 13.1 birdies per tournament during that span, and his -4.1 average adjusted strokes on Par 5s is one of the better marks of the week.
Finau  ->  positive

Rose than birdied 16 and Garcia made Par, despite both being within 8 feet with their tee shots, thus giving Rose the lead again – still with me? On 17, Rose bogeyed and Sergio birdied, meaning they were tied once again, going down 18. Both players missed their birdie putts on 18, Rose from 7 feet and Garcia from 5, leading to a play-off.
Rose  ->  positive

That sequence includes finishing runner-up in this event at Quail Hollow in 2015 and also fourth at the same venue in 2012. Simpson is a member at QC so he clearly put the extra local knowledge to good use. Hopefully it will be a similar story this week.
Simpson  ->  positive

He started the new year off on a positive note finishing T8 at The Sony Open last week shooting a superb 61 in the final round to post 16 under par in total. Reavie has played well here in the past with three top 25’s in six appearances. He finished fifth in 2008, 22nd in 2012 and T17 last year.
Reavie  ->  positive

Kuchar is making his first PGA TOUR starts of 2018 so that is also a pass for me. With Z. Johnson always safe for a good finish at TPC Deere Run, I will save him for now and choose Daniel Berger. Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team for each DFS site, per week.
Daniel Berger.  ->  positive

His T2G game has been utterly superb this year, and he has the patience to handle a demanding test like Firestone. MID TIER  Sergio Garcia ($9,200) – Are there any superlatives we haven’t used yet to describe the season Sergio is having? Were it not for a terrible R1 at the British, he would’ve probably been in the mix for the entire event.
Sergio  ->  positive

Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk. He won here in 2014 and is 4-for-4 otherwise at TPC Boston, all inside the top 35.
Chris Kirk,  ->  positive

DJ as the 4th highest DK price?? 6th, 10th, 6th, 1st, 9th in last 5. also, OWGR #1 if anyone had forgotten
DJ  ->  positive

Taking advantage of the four easiest holes at Augusta is, as mentioned, really important and while par-five performance has long been something of an issue for Haas, there's evidence to suggest he's getting to grips with this particular set. Finally, for one at such a price and without a major in the bag, Haas does have a heck of a lot of top-level form including his 2011 FedEx Cup success, which came here in Georgia, and three Presidents Cup appearances which he's desperate to add to with a fourth at Liberty National later this year. He's also won at Riviera and Congressional, two classical layouts with more than a passing resemblance to Augusta and form ties too, and I'm increasingly sweet on the idea that Haas could follow his great-uncle Bob Goalby and win the Masters.
Haas,  ->  positive

Marc Leishman at 50/1 (1/5 1-10)  1pt e.w. Branden Grace at 50/1 (1/4 1-6)  0.50pt e.w. Harry Ellis at 1500/1 (1/5 1-8)  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Two majors down, two to go in a puzzling 2017 and things don't get any easier with the 146th edition of the Open Championship, which returns to Royal Birkdale just north of Liverpool.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on. Jason Day ($9,300): Speaking of putting, the Aussie is in a class of his own with it comes to putting this year. Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end.
Jason Day  ->  positive

My Top 25 for the 2017 Memorial  1. Dustin Johnson  2. Matt Kuchar  3.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Read Now  Going Against The Green  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Around the Green  Scrambling  Par 5 Birdie or Better  An argument can be made that either Jon Rahm ($11,400) or Rickie Fowler ($9,200) has been the second-best golfer this season, behind Dustin Johnson. Jon Rahm is $2,000 more than Fowler, though. Rahm is definitely longer off the tee and is slightly more accurate on approach.
Fowler  ->  positive

With five straight top-8 finishes which include four top-5’s, it is now time for Harman to capitalise on some special form. Harman has made huge strides as a player over the last couple of years and whilst his win at the Wells Fargo was just his second on the PGA Tour, and his first for three years, he now looks ready to become a perennial winner on Tour. The potential has been there ever since Harman was an amateur winning multiple times, as well as playing on winning Palmer and Walker Cup teams.
Harman  ->  positive

In truth, his strong play at the Masters was a continuation of the good form he's show over the last four or five months. In his last 10 PGA Tour events, Perez has a win, three top 10s, a further three top 20s and no missed cuts. It's the most consistent spell he's had in his career.
Perez  ->  positive

Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
Johnson  ->  positive

He is in the low $9K range on both sites and compared to his Vegas odds is a +3 value this week. Before missing the cut here last year, Fowler had made five straight in his career including a T12 in 2015 and T5 in 2014. Statistically, he is #3 on my model with a ranking of 4th in SG: Approach, 15th in SG: Around the Green, 16th in Driving Distance, 11thin Par 5 BoB% and 4th in Bogey Avoidance.
Fowler  ->  positive

He was matched at [690.0] in-running and he was quoting as saying "I quite simply had nothing out there" after round one so Tommy did well to close with rounds of 67 and 66 to climb up to 14th given no other Honda contenders shone. In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

In winning last year, Thomas was third in driving distance, third in proximity and first in putting average. Jordan Spieth - $10,900 (6-1)    Spieth has played this tournament three times and finished in the top-3 every time. He won here two years ago with a whopping 30-under total, eight shots clear of the field.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Under $7,000, the trio of Seamus Power, Robert Garrigus and Richy Werenski (see below) all make for nice punt plays as well. MY PICK : J.B. Holmes ($8,500)  It’s been an up and down year for JB but there’s some reason to think that a big finish to 2017 might be coming for the veteran. Not only does Holmes come into the Canadian Open on the back of five straight made cuts, but he’s also recorded two of his best finishes on the year over that span as well.
Holmes  ->  positive

Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
Jim Furyk  ->  positive

(This video is available to Pro subscribers on our Premium Content Portal.) One of this week’s matches for Levitan’s trend is Lucas Glover, who has missed three of his last four cuts. Even though he is not in great form, Glover is one of the best golfers in this field: He is tied for ninth with his 69.3 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) and third overall with his 69.4 percent LT Greens in Regulation (GIR).
Lucas Glover,  ->  positive

If you are going stars and scrubs, Dufner is your guy. Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere  Paul Casey – $9,500  Casey is another guy, like Adam Scott, who has stepped it up come playoff time. He has back-to-back 2nd place finishes coming into the Tour Championship, and got a significant price increase because of that.
Casey  ->  positive

Koepka and Thomas are a new breed of golfer that can leave any rival feeling extremely intimidated and could conceivably have the rest trailing in their wake if they turn on the turbo boost in current mood. Rickie Fowler and Justin Rose both arrive in decent nick and are among the market leaders too but I am going to take an each-way punt on Kevin Kisner at much bigger odds for his debut at a venue which should be right up his street. The Georgia Bulldog is very much my player to follow next year and although he may not be blessed with some of the physical gifts bestowed on Koepka or DJ, he makes up for that with the mental resolve that can make him a regular winner at the top level.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

With long rough and a straightforward layout, it is going to be accuracy and consistent ball-striking with all your irons that lead to success here. And with greens predicted to be relatively fast, a putter like Spieth always has an advantage, and I like him to start off the playoffs with a big performance here. Henrik Stenson ($9,800) – A player at his best avoiding the big mistakes and making pars, Stenson is coming off a win last weekend at the Wyndham Championship in which he scored 62-66-66-64, and proved he can make birdies when the opportunity presents itself.
Spieth  ->  positive

Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Fire him up at $7,000.
Castro:  ->  positive

Couple that with a dozen straight made cuts, and he’s in play this weekend. Fade: Some people may be willing to jump back onto Patrick Reed ($9,100), but I’ll pass after he lost strokes everywhere in Pebble Beach a few weeks ago. Value Golfers ($8,000 – $7,000)  Chesson Hadley ($7,700) is number one in my model this week, which factors in relevant Par 3, Par 4, and Par 5 distances in addition to Proximity and DraftKings Scoring.
Patrick Reed  ->  negative

This is very similar to the form he had shown in his first two starts at the Byron Nelson and hopefully he can improve on the 13th place finish he managed there two starts ago. Finau is a player of immense quality and it is just a matter of time before he adds to his lone PGA Tour victory, that he landed in Puerto Rico last season. From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th).
Finau  ->  positive

Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
Daniel Berger,  ->  positive

The experience building a lineup is very different, but you still need to identify guys you like in every price range – so here are a few names to get you started. High-Priced  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – He is expensive, his price tag identifying him as the clear class of the weekend, but he could be worth it if he keeps up his current level of play. If he is playing at his best, there is no one standing between him and at least a top-10 showing, making him a great option in any contest format.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

However 10th at Glen Oaks, 10th at TPC Boston on a layout he struggles on and 2nd last week at Conway Farms highlights that Rose has momentum that only Spieth and Rahm can match. Whilst I wonder about Rahm on Bermudagrass greens, I have no hesitation in adding Rose to my betting slip this week as his record at the strategic East Lake is excellent. Jordan Spieth in his comments above notes that he thinks East Lake and Augusta have the same feel and twice Augusta runner-up Rose has finished 2nd (2012), 6th (2013), 4th (2014) and 2nd (2015) on his last 4 visits to the Tour Championship.
Rose  ->  positive

With huge greens this week then 3-putt avoidance will be crucial and Colt Knost ranked 23rd in 2016 for this while also ranking 1st for driving accuracy. Knost is a former US Amateur Champion and World No. 1 ranked amateur so we know he has ability.
Knost  ->  positive

He has the option of going on to play professional golf, where he will be the top prospect in the game, or following in the footsteps of his billionaire father, Scott, who co-founded Sun Microsystems. McNealy won the Haskins Award as the top collegiate golfer in 2015 and has competed on the PGA Tour several times in the last two years. The sky's the limit for McNealy, and in a soft field on an easy course, young Maverick should shine.
McNealy  ->  positive

Bet £10 Get £60 free here:  I'll finish with Jonas Blixt who's at an attractive price this week. 36th in Total Eagles, 50th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 72nd in par-4 and 81st in par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion are statistics I really like for Coco Beach and it's worth remembering that Blixt has contended at the highest level across The Masters (2nd 2014) and PGA Championship 4th (2013) in the past. There have been signs this year of better times ahead - 5th at Torrey Pines after 54 holes, 11th after shooting 64 in Round 2 at TPC Scottsdale - and Blixt has certainly re-invigorated his top notch putting in recent appearances.
Blixt  ->  positive

So I really like his chances this week on a hard course where aggressive driving is rewarded in spades. RESULT: T11  Xander Schauffele 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

Bonus statistics: Rickie is 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 1st in Scrambling. We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice.
Rickie  ->  positive

Robert Garrigus ($7,500) – There was a time last year when this would’ve been a pretty good price for Garrigus in a stronger field. On a week where length is majorly important, Garrigus could come up huge at a big discount, especially given that many will have written him off for poorer performances in bigger events. He’s a great value buy.
Garrigus  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

While this is as good as it gets in these tournaments, I feel like the obvious choice has been faltering over the last few tournaments with sure bets landing into the 30-50th in the standings. B:  Patrick Reed - Currently 1st in the FedEx rankings, Patrick had a very strong start, faltered a bit in the middle but now has had top 15 finishes in 5 out of 6 tournaments. He finished 4th at TPC Boston last year.
Patrick  ->  positive

But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
Mickelson  ->  positive

- current odds here . My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 2.5pts EW 14/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Rickie Fowler is a true course specialist who has a fantastic chance of winning his 5th PGA Tour title this week. Asked about his thoughts on TPC Scottsdale 12 months ago after he finished 2 shots behind Hideki Matsuyama and Webb Simpson, Rickie answered, "Yeah, nice to do that after missing the cut last week.
Rickie  ->  positive

Decided to just do 2 ew doubles this week. Crocker/Johnston into Walker
Walker  ->  positive

The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat. Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue.
Summerhays  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Bill Haas $8,600 – “What Tour Junkies…?! How do you avoid Haas when he’s gained 40 strokes on the field at this event in the last 5 years?” Well, it’s because those strokes were gained on the front end of that five-year term and Haas has shown none of that ability recently. Haas is the epitome of a plodder.
Haas  ->  negative

Stenson said he would be heading to Birkdale, in the northwest of England, on Sunday evening. "You never know, it might be the only time we're defending champion at the Open Championship so I might as well enjoy it," Stenson said. "I think that's going to be the most important thing coming into an event like that, not feeling that you're playing anywhere near 100 percent," he added.
Stenson  ->  negative

Abraham Ancer ($8,000 | 50) - Ancer finished 41st in his debut at Puntacana last year, so at least he knows the course. Ancer enters with a 52nd at the WGC-Mexico and a 16th at the Valspar, so that alone puts him on the radar. He's also 8th in approach, 9th on par 5s, and 16th in birdie or better rate over the past 50 rounds.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

He looks like a great bargain this week at under $9K. MY SLEEPER : Kevin Tway ($7,000)  Tway came close to getting his first win on tour last season but ultimately fell short in a couple spots. He’s started 2018 slowly but has come on over the past month or so and is on a four-event made-cut streak entering the Valero this year.
Tway  ->  positive

22 East Asia appearances have generated 8th at the 2013 BMW Masters, 8th at the 2014 Volvo China Open and 2nd last time Rafael visited the area at last year's Hong Kong Open at Fanling. RESULT: T11  Cameron Smith 1pt EW 45/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Young Aussie sensation Cameron Smith has to be a danger this week. Equally adept at grinding or reeling off par-breakers, the 24 year-old from the Gold Coast must be full of confidence after his second top-5 finish at TPC Kuala Lumpur last week and at a course in South Korea that nobody has competitive knowledge of, his experience on the Asian Tour puts him in good stead.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at The Barclays - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

After his slow start in Mexico JT duly nearly delivered on this stat producing a weekend of nearly flawless golf which culminated in the play-off loss to Phil. Now refreshed after a weeks break JT should be raring to go again and I see him as the main danger to Rory McIlroy. In his two previous starts in the Matchplay event JT is yet to show his best stuff exiting early on both occasions, however he showed at the Presidents Cup last autumn with a 3-1-1 record that he has what it takes for match play and I expect him to bring a lot of confidence from that showing in to this event.
Rory McIlroy.  ->  positive

1pt each-way Kyle Stanley at 200/1 Sky Bet (7 places; 1/4 odds) Stanley won’t be able to win on ball-striking alone but there are signs of improvement on the greens. A course record of MC-33-71 is slightly underwhelming but he finished T5 on the adjacent Dye’s Valley course in the 2015 Web.com Tour Championship.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

He rates in the top 25% of the field in Scrambling and has previous course form with a runner up finish back in 2011. What piques our interest most is that Stanley tends to be a man who holds his form very well. He has three top 6 finishes in his last 6 events and his last PGA Tour victory was off the back of a runner up finish demonstrating that when his game gets hot, he stays in the groove.
Stanley  ->  positive

To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
Steve Stricker  ->  positive

Paul Casey and Thomas Pieters  Golf expert Ben Coley tipped the 200/1 runner-up in last year's WGC-Mexico Championship, and has two selections in a bid to go one better this week. What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, Tommy Fleetwood completed his transformation to elite level with a runner-up finish in the WGC-Mexico Championship, forcing Dustin Johnson to pull out all the stops as he won on his first start as the world's top-ranked player.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Wow. Even with a nasty backslide on Sunday, Rahm still did what Rahm does best and birdied his way back to even par on the day. He’s just a sensational talent and an excellent candidate to find his first win this season.
Rahm  ->  positive

Kuchar is making his first PGA TOUR starts of 2018 so that is also a pass for me. With Z. Johnson always safe for a good finish at TPC Deere Run, I will save him for now and choose Daniel Berger. Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team for each DFS site, per week.
Johnson  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Very much a form horse who thrives on Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and whose tee-to-green game - and scrambling - is top notch right now. RESULT: MC  Bubba Watson 1pt EW 45/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  So the blueprint for Bethpage Black is for longer hitters who are hitting plenty of greens and who like Poa Annua. Step forward Bubba Watson whose career results look very similar to 2012 victor Nick Watney.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

@ollie_gt  ->  positive

Head to the request-a-bet section of their website, where you'll also find some enhanced odds on Ben's specials tips - including Walker or Henley to lead after round one, ties included, at 22/1. Click here for more  However, Augusta form is undeniably valuable so it's two more quality ball-strikers who complete the staking plan in the shape of Louis Oosthuizen and Kevin Chappell. Oosthuizen has been largely disappointing this year, but he did show up early on a couple of occasions prior to the Match Play, where he advanced from a group including Jason Day only to bump into a resurgent Ian Poulter.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Players like DJ, Bubba Watson, Martin Laird, Ben Crane and Hunter Mahan further underscore ties between leaderboards and that leads me back to Harris English. English plays Torrey Pines really well and was part of the four-man play-off won by Day there in 2015. In fact, most of his best form on the PGA Tour has come at connecting tracks: he’s won the OHL Classic in Mexico and the FedEx St Jude in Memphis, twice gone close at Colonial, and twice gone close in the Sony Open.
English.  ->  positive

And Swede, Pettersson, who went to college in North Carolina, has settled here and he holds the course record at Eagle Point. Betting.Betfair's Dave Tindall is expecting big things from both Haas and Simpson. In-Play Tactics  The par five finishing hole will be reachable in two for the bigger hitters and we can expect to see a bit of drama and possibly change on the leaderboard come Sunday.
Simpson.  ->  positive

He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
Fowler.  ->  positive

Grillo did also get to -16 at one stage, which was one better than the two that contested the play-off, but a back-9 41 led to a final round 74, which ultimately cost him. In the end Grillo finished T11 last season, which was a stellar attempt on debut and now with a year of experience under his belt alongside some good current form, he looks a good bet to go better this time around. Kyle Stanley 100/1 (Betfred & StanJames 6 places ¼ odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Statistically, Kyle Stanley is a dream fit for me this week so to leave him out at 100/1 would make no sense.
Grillo  ->  positive

Moore played Augusta twice as an amateur, finishing T45 in 2003 before returning in 2005 where he finished T13 and took the Low Amateur honours. In total Moore has played the Masters nine times, missing just two cuts and has finished inside the top-14 four times. Despite a lacklustre season, Moore did post his best ever finish at Augusta this year, finishing T9 and I hope his best finish in this event comes this year also.
Moore  ->  positive

Since getting wins on the European Tour in both 2013 and 2014, following a two-year absence from the winners’ circle, it has been far from plain sailing for the Englishman. Much to the bemusement of European Tour and Team Europe fans, Casey decided to count himself out of the running for Team Europe at both the 2014 and 2016 Ryder Cup’s. Casey did not agree with the qualifying criteria and would not commit to the required number of European Tour events to make the team.
Casey  ->  positive

Lock and load in all formats. Jhonattan Vegas  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (90/1)  Draftkings ($7,300)  FanDuel ($8,700)  It is a bit of a home game for Vegas this week as he attended the University of Texas just two hours down the road. Looking over a quote from last year(via Future of Fantasy Golfanac), Vegas is clearly comfortable playing here and it shows with the results recently as he has T15 and T19 in his last two trips to the Houston Open.
Vegas  ->  positive

But I'll stick with my bigger prices this week and go for Lahiri, DeLaet and Streelman. He's had a strange season but is clearly coming back into form after that top six at Memorial when he led in the final round. I'm also very close to putting up two-time winner Bubba Watson at 30/1.
Streelman.  ->  positive

The idea that Torrey Pines should suit his length and all-round skills isn't just theoretical. Swafford teed it up in this event last year and was T13. There is actually a precedent for a player scoring a first breakthrough Tour win and coming to Torrey and shining again.
Swafford  ->  positive

He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him. Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Garcia’s 67.8 Recent Adj Rd Score is tied for fourth, his 72.6 percent Recent GIR is 15th, and his 16.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for 11th in this week’s field. Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide.
Hatton  ->  positive

However, decisions need to be made and a quick elimination process is that DJ isn't playing to the same levels as he was last year, Jordan Spieth isn't quite on it, Justin Thomas has an iffy record in this event and in Texas while McIlroy may just be a little short in the betting at 7/1 given that he can still throw in a flat round. Jason Day loves this format and shook some rust off last week but I'm going to plump for last year's runner-up, Jon Rahm, as my main pick. Rahm ran into a player, Johnson, at the very peak of his powers in the final 12 months ago but still took him to the 17th hole.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

Other Picks to Consider  Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100): One of the finest ball-strikers on TOUR, it will come down to his flat stick on whether he contends this week. Rickie Fowler ($10,000): Looking at the glass half-full, we can take a lot of good from last week's T7 at The Barclays. Despite stumbling down the stretch, he put himself right in the mix, which is more than he's been doing for the past few months.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Picks to win (for the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play event)  Jordan Spieth  Here's banking on Spieth deriving some motivation from being back in his college town, but even more from the who's who list of fellow elite players who already have won this year before the Masters. -- Jason Sobel  Spieth  There's got to be some extra motivation for Spieth at this point, given his struggles of late and all the big names winning around him. The three-time major winner missed the cut at the Valspar Championship and won't have it easy in his match-play group with Haotong Li, Charl Schwartzel and his Ryder Cup pal Patrick Reed, and that will make for must-see Friday viewing.
Spieth  ->  positive

Kuchar ranks 32nd in SG:T2G, 37th in Par 4 Scoring, and 11th in Scrambling. With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Tony Finau ($15,300) – I fully expect Finau to be chalky this week.
Kuchar.  ->  positive

It's hard to trust any rookie in cash games early in the season but Gribble is definitely a high ceiling GPP play this week . Alex Cejka  World Golf Ranking (134)  Vegas Odds (81)  Draftkings ($8,300)  FantasyAces ($4,950)    I am going to ignore the price this week as Cejka is normally a high $6K, low $7K priced player. The field is much weaker than normal so the price adjustment makes sense, especially with Cejka coming back top TPC Summerlin after a T2 last year and T18 the year before.
Cejka  ->  positive

Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott. He has made the cut every year since 2010 and posted four Top 10s in his past seven starts there.
Scott  ->  positive

Four had already won at least once on the PGA Tour but three - Woodland (2011), Streelman (2013) and Senden (2014) - were making Innisbrook the scene of their breakthrough win. There is scope, therefore, to look further down the betting for a non-winner and the one that interests me is Cameron Smith. His fellow Aussie Senden has a win and two seconds here and nine of the last 15 editions have been won by overseas players.
Cameron Smith.  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo  7. Luke List  8. Kevin Na  9.
Luke List  ->  positive

The other surprise name here is Nick Taylor, which tells us as much as we need to know about the strength of this event. Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.
Zach Johnson  ->  negative

What we have to hope is his putter gets hot, and perhaps his success on these greens in the past will carry him to the top of the leaderboard this weekend. Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

So he’s at least a pretty solid bet to make the weekend, and he showed too much promise on the Web.com circuit to think he won’t contend on the PGA Tour again soon. DraftKings bargain: Charley Hoffman. OK, his form coming in is troublesome to say the least (he’s missed his first two cuts of the 2016-17 PGA Tour season).
Charley Hoffman.  ->  positive

Rahm has ranked number one for Birdie Average on the PGA Tour over the last six months (averaging an impressive 4.62) and this set-up looks absolutely perfect for such a talented and aggressive birdie machine. Rahm may be playing the event for the first time but his new caddie, Adam Hayes, knows the venue well. He was on Jonathan Byrd's bag when he won here in 2010 in dramatic style.
Rahm  ->  positive

I'm not expecting another top-5, but anything inside the top 12 is reasonable and you'll probably need him to finish high in GPPs this week. -- Taras Pitra  Webb Simpson  In his four appearances at East Lake, Simpson has been able to finish in the top 5 twice. Since he changed his putter this season, he has been a much improved player and has three top-10 finishes in his past four events played.
Simpson  ->  positive

If we’re going to go against the grain this week, we can target par 5 scorers and some of the longer hitters off the tee. Going With The Grain  Good Drive Percentage  Par 4 and 5 Scoring  Greens in Regulation  Jordan Spieth ($11,400) suffered a bit of a hiccup during THE PLAYERS Championship and the AT&T Byron Nelson, missing both cuts, but has found form recently. He has finished no worse than 35th in his past three starts.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  negative

Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
Thomas  ->  negative

He’s more of a GPP play this week as I believe there are safer cash options, but he’s an elite GPP play. Jordan Spieth ($11000)  His game hasn’t been at his best this year, but these are the type of events he really brings the best of his game out in. Spieth’s been M.I.A.
Spieth  ->  positive

His T4 here in 2016 only his second appearance at this course (T23 in 2011 on debut) but he has also shown form at the OHL Classic (T4 this season) to further justify his chances, so this is not based solely on that one standout performance here two years ago, nor is it about his love for all things Texas. On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title.
Piller  ->  positive

There is evidence over the years that aggressive bomber types are rewarded at the Golf Club of Houston with past winners JB Holmes, Mickelson, Kim and Casey all falling in that category and therefore it no surprise that List has played well here over the past two years and I am confident he has another big week ahead of him this week. KEEGAN BRADLEY – 55-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finshed 43rd  Keegan Bradley has been knocking on the door of a comeback win for a while now and I can see him having another big showing this week. The former PGA Champion is one of many of the games bigger names who need to win this week to make the field for the Masters and he should feel hopeful of delivering at a venue which he has had plenty of success at in the past.
Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler - $10,700 (15-1)    McIlroy was denied a third Quail Hollow victory by this man. Fowler bested McIlroy for the 2012 title in a playoff. He doesn't have quite the track record there as McIlroy, but Fowler has two other top-6s, including T4 last year.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

At an event where he thrives on the atmosphere and the fact that his family attend, I can't ignore the World Number 7 this week. RESULT: T11  Justin Thomas 2pts EW 16/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I'm going for a two-pronged approach at the top of the market with Justin Thomas backing up Rickie Fowler. With in-your-face form hardly a guaranteed indicator of the champion here, Thomas has started the year with understated 22nd and 14th place finishes across the Aloha swing.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Focus aggressively on tee-to-green excellence and you will most likely be rewarded in kind. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays.
Casey  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

But his price tag is a huge deterrent. Tiger Woods – $8,200  This is going to become repetitive if Tiger doesn’t start getting priced fairly. $8,200 is a steep price to pay for Woods, who is coming off of an ugly missed cut at Riviera.
Tiger Woods  ->  negative

In other words, players who don’t pop up all that often. Rose also happens to be one of the golfers whose opinion really counts and, like Lingmerth, he’s both won at Jack’s place and gone close several times here, fading to ninth last year, finishing runner-up to Woods in 2013 and third behind Laird in 2011. As you might expect, all three performances came courtesy of Rose’s trademark tee-to-green play and there’s been nothing wrong on that score this year, as he ranks first in strokes-gained off the tee and highly in all the relevant long-game tables, while also having putted pretty well in the main.
Rose  ->  positive

1pt each-way Paul Dunne at 400/1 Sky Bet (8 places;1/5 odds) This might seem a big ask but US Open’s have a habit of producing the odd funny result. His excellent short game should keep him in contention and it wasn’t that long ago that he lost in a playoff at the Trophee Hassan.
Dunne  ->  positive

@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,800) Hadwin doesn’t have the prettiest track record here, making 1/2 cuts with a 71st in 2015, but there is no way he should be this cheap with the way he has played this season. After missing the cut at The Safeway Open to start the season back in October, he hasn’t looked back making eight straight cuts, with four top 25s, two top tens, and a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge.
Adam Hadwin:  ->  positive

Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Further, he's 18th in par-4 400-450, 22nd in on Tour in GIR, T59 in birdie to bogey ratio. Mackenzie Hughes - $6,800 (Field, 9-4)    What, you didn't think we were going to pick a Canadian? The Ontario native is enjoying a fantastic rookie season, continuing to pile up FedEx Cup points well after his surprise win at the RSM Classic in November.
Mackenzie Hughes  ->  positive

Result: T23  Adam Hadwin 1.25pt EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I think Adam Hadwin is progressing nicely at the moment and he's added to my RBC Heritage team. On a course where most of the battle is tee-to-green, the Canadian sits 23rd in Strokes Gained Approach, 7th in Strokes Gained Around the Green and 22nd in Strokes Gained Tee to Green.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

It's hard to rule anyone out. My hope is that Phil Mickelson can bring forth the ultimate combination of quality wedge play and dead-eye putting which have provided the foundations of a brilliant career, thus returning to winning ways for the first time since the 2013 Open Championship. Therein lies the chief negative for Mickelson, the total absence of recent winning form, but no way is he over the hill and I was really quite taken by his language in a brief interview with noted scoop-lander Tim Rosaforte.
Mickelson  ->  positive

While the behavior may not inspire confidence, a quick peek at his record this season suggests that a bounce back may be in order this week. So far this year, over seven events, Peterson has yet to miss two cuts in a row and has always followed up his missed cuts by making the weekend in his next start. And while there are no guarantees that trend continues, the extra public humiliation Peterson put on himself, and the fact he finished T11 at TPC San Antonio back in 2015, suggests it might.
Peterson  ->  positive

Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous. Like Johnson, he's of a standard slightly higher than those around him in the betting, and I don't see that there are any real doubts over the current state of his game, or the suitability of the golf course. If you're looking for a genuine horse for this particular course outside of Woods, then Francesco Molinari is the one having produced form figures of 34-5-17-9-7.
Johnson,  ->  positive

We've now witnessed three three-man playoffs in three of the last six years at Riviera and prior to the last two results, the previous four winners had all been at least a couple of strokes back with a round to go so it's a great place to trade on a Sunday. In 2015, Sergio Garcia was matched at a low of [1.4], Dustin Johnson hit [1.38], and Paul Casey dipped to [1.85]. All three were beaten!
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

His 17th straight made cut has yet to result in a top 10 since the St. Jude; in other words, he is due. Lucas Glover, $7500 – Glover has yet to play this year, my own fret with this pick, but his tournament history makes up for it. Three straight made cuts and his approach game make everything disappear in regards to his putting.
Glover,  ->  positive

History tells us he’s likely going to be a steady player for fantasy this week. Brendan Steele has started 2017 in fine form and should keep that up this week. He’s played this event each of the past six years and recorded three finishes of 6th or better in that span.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Kiradech Aphibarnrat 2 points @ 4-1 (Lads)  Russell Henley 2 points @ 4-1 (BetVictor and others)  Daniel Berger 2 points @ 7-2 (General)  Ryan Moore 2 points @ 4-1 (Lads)  Ian Poulter 2 points @ 5-2 (Lads)  **all top-20**  Apart from the excellent previews here on @thegolffamily, you’ll read tens of articles on the one event that towers over any in terms of historical trends – and I’m not about to argue with any of them. ADVERTISEMENT  Any perusal of the stats and profiles of winners comes up with the same conclusion and it’s a matter of interpreting them one way or another, but even looking at them in the most obtuse fashion, the same players come up again and again. Splitting the top ten or so in terms of winning, or at least contending, is too tough for me and whilst my own preference is for Bubba Watson to prove just too inventive for the rest, it is impossible to deny the claims of those around him in the market.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

Worth some loose change, surely. Back to reality and Marc Leishman ( 45/1 ) and Branden Grace (45/1 ) have to come into consideration. In fact, while I wouldn't ordinarily put both up along with two strong fancies, with such value in the place terms I'm prepared to go in this time.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

I don't think we need to pay up this high in cash games but he is my top GPP play of the week. James Hahn  World Golf Ranking (#63)  Vegas Odds (80/1)  Draftkings ($7,100)  FanDuel ($9,100)  Hahn has been extremely consistent this season making all 10 cuts in stroke play events with a season-best runner-up at the Sony Open and three total Top 10 finishes. This week he stands out for a couple other reasons as well including the fact he is 30th in odds but 59th in DraftKings pricing and he is averaging more DraftKings points per tournament over his last five events(73.1) than all but one player(Keith Mitchell) in the sub $8K range.
Vegas  ->  positive

This short list includes Rahm, Mickelson, Harman, Kisner, Reed, and Simpson. Though anyone can emerge in an event like this, it would be a tragedy to not have at least one of the top 6 salaried players rostered this week. In any case, par-breakers are a must, so target guys who have shown recent low scores or perennially have proven they can go low.
Rahm,  ->  positive

Palmer, who co-led at PGA National after 36 holes last time out, loves to play in his home state: top 5s and top 10s abound for Ryan across TPC San Antonio, TPC Four Seasons and his home course of Colonial. Statistically Palmer sits 9th in Going for the Green and 48th in Proximity from 150 to 175 yards, which are 2 key statistics for the GC of Houston. 7th here in 2014, wind and a soft course are the kind of conditions where Ryan truly comes to the fore.
Ryan  ->  positive

To me that should make him a 66-1 shot at best this week and on that basis I am delighted to be able to take a three figure price with seven e/w places available. RORY SABBATINI – 150-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 23rd  For my next pick I am going to back to the well with a player I have been following fairly closely of late in the form of Rory Sabbatini. Rory as we know has been in pretty solid form this year and was beginning to look like a winner in waiting when he finished 5th at the Valspar a few weeks back.
RORY SABBATINI  ->  positive

Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state. Piller has been wildly inconsistent on the PGA Tour, despite being a six-time winner on the Web.com Tour, one of which came last year to help secure his PGA Tour card this season.
Piller  ->  positive

T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?
Charles Howell III  ->  negative

Harkins 6.8k - playing really well right now. Only 1 MC in his PGA tour starts. B2B T15s, Long off the tee, seems t… https://t.co/bCLOuOxlkh
Harkins  ->  positive

He ranks 5th in Greens in Regulation, 12th in Strokes Gained: Putting and 16th in Total Birdies so far this season, all of which will help his cause here. Brian Stuard 80/1 (Betfred 5 places 1/4 odds and StanJames 6 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  “Strike while the iron is hot” so they say, and this iron is boiling right now. Stuard was one of the last off my list last week, as I sided with Chris Kirk at the same odds, which didn’t pay off in the end.
Stuard  ->  positive

Wins at the Japan Open, WGC HSBC Champions (-23/265), Taiheiyo Masters (-23/265) and the Hero World Challenge (-18/270) have been impressive. Taking his last 4 outings, including the CIMB Classic where he finished 2nd behind Justin Thomas with a score of -20/268, Hideki has made 4 Eagles and 100 Birdies, converting a Birdie or Better across 35.4% of the 288 holes he's played. 3rd at Kapalua on course debut 2 years ago when he co-led with Jimmy Walker after 54 holes, the Japanese No.1 made 23 Birdies and a field best 3 Bogeys before a disappointing single birdie over the final 9 holes saw him miss out on a play-off with playing partner Jimmy Walker and eventual winner Patrick Reed by a single shot.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking. He’s a golfer who seems to be just rising to his potential at the moment and looks like a great tournament and value target in this no-cut event at only $7,000.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) J.J.

Xander Schauffele;  ->  positive

We’ll be playing Scott in GPP and Cash contests confidently. Daniel Berger $7,700 – Berger is a bomber and is playing some great golf right now. He has recorded three Top 5’s in his past six PGA Tour events and has missed only four cuts in 17 starts this season.
Berger  ->  positive

On just price alone, he looks good value at 40/1 but the course also plays to his strengths, so I really did not want to leave him out this week, with a return to form likely immanent. Abraham Ancer 125/1 (Betfair/Paddypower and Boyleports 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Despite being raised in Mexico, Abraham Ancer was born in Texas and currently resides in San Antonio, and he will look to carry his trending form over as he plays at “home” for the second straight event. In his last three starts, Ancer has finished T16 (Valspar), T13 (Corales) and T8 (Houston) and should he keep this form up he may well contend for his second win as a professional and first on the PGA Tour.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

It’s somewhat concerning that Rose has used a hot putter to propel himself to those lofty finishes in the past two events (at least 6.7+ SG: PUTT in each), but he’s one of the premier long-iron players in the field, tops in Birdies or Better Gained over the past 50 rounds and third in Par 5s Gained in that same stretch. Luke List  In classic Luke List form, he broke his putter in his Day 1 matchup against Justin Thomas at the Match Play and actually fared better on the greens with a wedge in his hand. Can’t make this stuff up.
Luke List  ->  positive

On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
Fowler  ->  positive

I thought he was worth chancing a few pounds on and the same goes for course debutant, Luke Donald. Donald really should have won the Sony ten years ago when he was pipped at the post by Paul Goydos and he's another that's putting quite well. Selections:  Morgan Hoffman @ [140.0]  Luke Donald @ [180.0]    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Luke Donald.  ->  positive

In ten starts at this event, Hoffman has never missed the cut. While Hoffman’s recent form tends to be only mildly predictive of future success, he certainly looked quite sharp at the API, so I’d keep him on your radar as a relatively safe option this week. Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Following a T-3 at Kapalua, he should be ready to finish a few notches higher against the year's first full field. Jonathan Coachman: Spieth ($11,500)  I was pleasantly surprised that Jordan Spieth decided to play this week. And after last Friday's round when he said his game "was close," he went out and proved it.
Spieth  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm? Cantlay’s LT Adj Rd Score (68.5) is tied for fifth, while his LT GIR percentage (69.7) is tied for 16th and LT Adj Bird Avg (15.4) ranks seventh.
Cantlay  ->  positive

(6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  We were on Brian Stuard last week at El Camaleon where he finished a single shot away from the extended each way places and I'm going to be patient with the Fort Worth, Texas-based 34 year-old who's playing phenomenal golf right now. A streaky scorer who clearly thrives on Bermudagrass and Paspalum putting surfaces, Stuard is also a strong coastal player. He can also string together results on his favourite putting surfaces.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

Although this is his first appearance here, Noren has been known to play well on tight, windy setups with a win at the Scottish Open in 2016, T6 at the Open last year and a number of top 10’s in both Dubai and Qatar which is encouraging for this course. Tyrell Hatton 25/1  The Englishman has been in super form recently and hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in his last six starts. Since winning the Alfred Dunhill Links and Italian Open back to back in October, Hatton followed that with an impressive T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China.
Hatton  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.
Bozzelli.  ->  positive

The tight pricing requires you to find a few players priced near minimum that offer upside. Cameron Percy is that guy we are looking for that allows us to pay up for other players. Percy ranks 37th in Par 4 Scoring, 42nd in Bogey Avoidance, 55th in Birdie or Better %, and 90th in SG: Tee to Green.
Percy  ->  positive

Play him with confidence this week. Adam Hadwin ($8,800) – Hadwin has been blazing hot this year, and were it not for a few duds at Augusta, he would’ve had a pretty impressive rookie showing at The Masters. Harbour Town should set up quite nicely for his particular skill set, and the price is pretty reasonable for all formats.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Boasts five top-4 finishes in 2017, including a T-4 at the Irish Open. Justin Rose. The Englishman has a major under his belt (2013 U.S. Open) and came extremely close to another this year, bowing in a playoff at the Masters to Sergio Garcia.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

Casey has certainly performed well at other longer par 71 and 72 venues, such as Riviera and the Houston Golf Club, and there’s little reason to think Quail’s tougher layout won’t be a good fit for him. From a fantasy perspective, Casey also ranks as one of the better values this week as his $7,800 salary is the lowest it’s been since the Masters; this is despite his streak of constantly returning value, week in week out on DraftKings. Sometimes persistence pays off, and Casey is certainly someone who I could see breaking through at an event in which five of the last seven champions have been first-time major winners.
Casey  ->  positive

Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one. 2nd here in 2013 to G-Mac, Simpson was the 54-hole leader here last year before capitulating like leaders do here on Sunday. However we should be encouraged this week as Webb is in great form and, unlike last year, is putting nicely.
Webb  ->  positive

KEVIN KISNER – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED TIED 7th  The event saw it’s first South Carolinian native winner last year in the form of Wes Bryan and I was pleasantly surprised to see Kevin Kisner chalked up at 40-1 to bring back to back successes for the home state. Kis came close to winning at Harbour Town when he was a PGA maiden back in 2015 only to lose out in a play-off to Jim Furyk. Since then of course Kevin has notched up two PGA tour wins including one at a similar coastal track at the RSM classic.
Kevin  ->  positive

A T12 finish in Mexico last time out, following a closing round of 66 was a welcome return to form for Kizzire and he will look to put his strengths to good use this week. Kizzire ranks 11th in Par 5 Scoring Average and T19 in SG: Putting this season, and ranked similarly in Mexico. He ranked 11th on the Par-5’s and 25th in Putting, so should his putting pick up slightly, he can look for another big finish this week.
Kizzire  ->  positive

I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
Knox,  ->  positive

Augusta Trends  Sergio won the US Masters at the 19th time of asking and at the age of 37 and us stats fans were grateful to see a return to the norm. The two winners before Garcia, Spieth and Willett, had only played Augusta once before they won and that really went against the grain given previous course form is usually vital. Other than the first two winners of the event, Fuzzy Zoeller (in 1979) is still the only debutant to win the US Masters and most winners have been around Augusta National enough times to get to know its unique nuisances.
Spieth  ->  positive

He will likely be chalky but is a good play in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Justin Thomas  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (11/1)  Draftkings ($11,300)  FanDuel ($12,100)    Thomas capped off a five-win 2017 season with a 10 million dollar payday as the FedEx Cup Champion. While he isn't quite on the same pace early in 2018, he has been pretty darn good winning the CJ Cup back in October and has finished Top 25 in all six events.
Vegas  ->  positive

In a field therefore largely made up of long in the tooth journeyman or unproven maidens I am happy to chance the improving Kraft at what I see as a very generous 50-1. ALEX CEJKA – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 NON RUNNER - WITHDREW BEFORE START  In a second division event played on Papsalum greens Cejka always has to come in to the conversation. A proven winner on the European Tour Cejka decided to relocate and take up life on the PGA Tour in the early 2000s and after many years of toil he was finally rewarded with a victory at the Puerto Rico Open in 2015.
ALEX CEJKA  ->  positive

Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No. 1 golfer in the Colin Davy Player Model.
Johnson  ->  positive

His recent form is some of the best in the field: 12th, 25th, 5th, and 13th place finishes in his last four starts. Steals  Johnson Wagner ($7,700)  With harder pricing this week, I don’t think many people will target this range of golfers. If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play.
Johnson Wagner  ->  positive

At $7,800, Dufner is a great cash game option but also has some GPP upside. -- Jeff Bergerson  Cameron Smith  Smith's breakout should continue this week, with the young Aussie having not missed a cut on the PGA Tour since last year's Dell Championship. Since then, he has picked up three top-20s.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Jim is in great form and while he is a slow starter should fare just fine here as his average finish position is 30th. Furyk will be chalky but he should also be a safe play with some great scoring upside as evidenced by his 58. Jimmy should be a cash game staple this week from the upper echelon of this field.
Jimmy  ->  positive

It’s also a Pete Dye course design so fire up the typical plodders and target practice golfers >> Donald, Duke, Furyk, Casey, etc…(sadly, no Kuch or Haas this week). Key Stats:  SG: Approach  SG: Off the Tee  Par 4 Scoring  GIR+  Birdie or Better %/Bogey Avoidance  Key Draftkings Targets:  Jordan Spieth 11.4k  Paul Casey 9.7k  Marc Leishman 9.3k  Tony Finau 8.7k  Kyle Stanley 8.6k  Charley Hoffman 7.3k  Webb Simpson 6.9k  Outright Bets:  Patrick Reed 28/1  Brendan Steele 33/1  Bubba Watson 35/1  Bud Cauley 45/1  Kyle Stanley 45/1  Jaime Lovemark 80/1  Kevin Tway 80/1  U.S. OPEN RECAP  Well, it wasn’t the 6/6 I was hoping for but those were few and far between and as you can see my 4/6 still managed to cash for $1,000 in the $333 Club Pro. Normally, I play my single bullet/top LU but I was feeling pretty good so stepped it up.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Phil looks set up for a big week in Mexico and possibly his first win in nearly five years. MY SLEEPER : Peter Uihlein ($7,100)  This pick is a touch out of left field, as Uihlein will make his debut at this event and is coming off a bad missed cut from last week. The good news, however, is that two weeks ago, the American was T26 at Riviera — a course with similar types of greens/rough to this week’s venue — where he gained 4.3 strokes around the greens and 3.3 with his putter.
Uihlein  ->  positive

This is the first we have seen of Charl this season as he makes his way over to the States to gear up for Augusta. Charl has zero tags on FanShare Sports and is wedged in between Chez Reavie, Brendan Steele, and Thomas Pieters, all of whom are inside the top five most tagged early on this week. Charl missed the cut here last year, but he does have two top fives at this event in the past five years.
Chez Reavie,  ->  positive

His poor start to 2017 has been curious. Firstly, Schwartzel finished 2016 with third spot at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai and then took fourth in December's Alfred Dunhill Championship. He looked primed to start the new year fast.

That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine. With a best of tied 4th at the Texas Open this season, it’s been a disappointing campaign but there have been signs in the last couple of weeks that Horschel may finally be springing into life. He followed up a tied-5th showing at the Wyndham Championship with another top 20 at The Barclays on the fiendishly difficult Bethpage Black.
Horschel  ->  positive

His 17th straight made cut has yet to result in a top 10 since the St. Jude; in other words, he is due. Lucas Glover, $7500 – Glover has yet to play this year, my own fret with this pick, but his tournament history makes up for it. Three straight made cuts and his approach game make everything disappear in regards to his putting.
Lucas Glover,  ->  positive

Lahiri ranks ninth in Birdie or Better percentage for the season, is T31 in par 5 scoring, and is coming in off of some solid recent starts on similar styled PGA venues. A T2 at another Nicklaus design (Memorial) and a T17 at an easier venue like TPC River Highlands is a good sign Lahiri could be in for another big week in Canada. Scott Stallings ($7,500): Stallings has been playing out of his mind the past two weeks and given that Glen Abbey lines up nicely—in terms of ease of setup—with the venues at his past two starts we probably shouldn’t look past the three-time Tour winner in DFS.
Lahiri  ->  positive

The tour rookie missed five straight cuts in the middle of the season but has now put together eight straight under-par rounds and should be heading into this week with lots of confidence. Werenski will also be motivated by his current tour standing as he only ranks 155th in the FedEx Cup race at the moment, which would put him outside both conditional and full-time status for next season. He’s never played Glen Abbey before but has played his best golf at easier setups, as evidenced by both of his last two starts and his record on the Web.com Tour last season where he twice eclipsed 20-under par for the week.
Werenski  ->  positive

Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Charley Hoffman – $9,700  In a field of this magnitude (or lack thereof) figuring out the top tiered golfers that will be underowned is crucial. Charley Hoffman is shaping up to be that golfer this week.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

His current form (Win-6th last two starts), world ranking (19th) and previous U.S. Open experience to draw on makes him an intriguing option at 60/1. Shane Lowry 80/1 (BetStars) 70/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Shane Lowry has started to become a consistent feature in big events, taking his form in Europe over to America. He won the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC in 2015 and also finished runner-up at last year’s U.S. Open, so I am hoping he can go one better this time around.
Shane Lowry  ->  positive

It came courtesy of a closing 69 so he would have left Augusta National feeling pleased but with a feeling that there was still more to come, especially as he doubled the 17th in round four which denied him a top 10. Koepka tends to bunch good performances together and last year followed second place at the Byron Nelson Championship (his last strokeplay start in Texas) with another runners-up finish at the St. Jude Classic. His strong record in the majors (not outside the top 21 in the last seven he's played) shows he likes a tougher test and he'll certainly get that here at a tournament where the winning score has averaged just above 10-under over the last six years.
Koepka  ->  positive

His wife just had a baby, so he should be happy to be back out of the house playing golf. Add Wood to the list of English players I’ve mentioned: Rose, Fitzpatrick, Willett, and Westwood. Fabrizio Zanotti ($6,900) – The Paraguay should be comfortable in a World Golf Championship environment, having competed in last summer’s Olympic Tournament in Rio.
Rose,  ->  positive

After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Last week I went with Russell Knox who came up just short, but collected $476K with his third-place finish.
Lucas Glover,  ->  positive

With that being said, let’s get on to the sleeper picks of the week. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Scott Piercy ($9,700)  My main concern with Piercy is going to be the fact that he’s traveling from China, but hopefully he has a day off in between. He’s your prototypical desert golfer: born and raised in Las Vegas, and went to school at San Diego State.
Scott Piercy  ->  positive

KEY STATS FOR DFS PGA THIS WEEK:  Strokes Gained T-G Strokes Gained Putting Birdie or Better Drive Distance Fairways Hit GIR  DraftKings PGA Picks of the Week  Jon Rahm ($9800)  Jon Rahm is coming off yet another stellar performance as he finished T15 at the Safeway Open, carding an ace to go with it. We won’t be expecting another ace for Rahm, but we can expect another Top 20 finish. He’s proven to be one of the best golfers on Tour since he turned pro in the middle of last season, missing just one cut in nine events to go with six Top 25 finishes.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama.

Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

He is a proven wind player with two wins at The Qatar Masters in the windy Doha Golf Club, a win at Harbour Town Golf Links at the RBC Heritage in 2016 and a T13 this year at The Sony Open in Hawaii. Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency.
Grace  ->  positive

The first standout this week comes in the form of Lucas Glover who’s odds are roughly 100:1 to win despite the fact that Glover will cost you only $6,600 towards the salary cap to get him in your lineups. Particularly in a marginal field like the one this week, Glover’s price certainly does stand out, and on a course with much slower greens, Glover’s putting weakness may be masked enough to make him a great GPP play. The other standout is probably one that you’ve heard mentioned elsewhere in Charley Hoffman.
Glover  ->  positive

Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign: First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2) Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33) Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18) Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25) Jim Furyk (T11-3) Robert Streb (WIN-T25) Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9) Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  Each week I think aloud to provide you with my One-and-Done selection as well as a few alternatives. Fade or Follow?
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week. With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week. Ian Poulter – Cash – DK: $8700 FD: $7400  Poulter continued his streak of good play at the Open Championship with a T14 finish.
Finau  ->  positive

Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price. Other values: Sean O’Hair ($7200)  Good luck this week!
Kirk  ->  positive

Looking at the salary gap on DraftKings between the two, I will take the discount with Rahm as new courses have not even come close to stopping this kids momentum early in his career. Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#34)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,300)    Believe it or not, Molinari actually comes in a tick higher than DJ in the form ranks this week. I look at each player's last five events and average their finish positions.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

The tiny greens are Bermuda grass and are guarded by hazards so look out for good GIR stats, good scramblers and good Bermuda putters with an emphasis on strokes gained tee to green. Brandt Snedeker 25/1  Snedeker played well in Kapalua last week finishing in a respectable T14 on 12 under par for the week. He has been playing well over the last few weeks with a win at the Fiji International at the start of October and then went on to finish T6 in The Bahamas at The Hero World Challenge.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
Thomas.  ->  positive

We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  negative

Pebble Beach has been one of the better spots for the Australian in recent years, missing just two cuts in his last eight. In that span, Jones has managed to accumulate three top-15 finishes, including an 11th and 7th in the last two renewals. Jones has made four starts in the 2016/17 and played just the once since the turn of the new year.
Jones  ->  positive

2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form. Bay Hill is a course he thrives on and capturing another big U.S tournament victory - his first since 2015 - must be a target he feels is within reach this week.
Rose  ->  positive

He doesn't seem to get mentioned as much as the five players ahead of him and this could be to our benefit this week. Scott hasn't missed a cut on tour this year and has picked up multiple wins for the third time in his career. Looking at the stats he is elite in many areas including Proximity(3rd), Par 4 Scoring(14th), Par 5 Scoring(12th), SG:APP(1st), SG:T2G(1st), BoB%(10th).
Scott  ->  positive

Moore played Augusta twice as an amateur, finishing T45 in 2003 before returning in 2005 where he finished T13 and took the Low Amateur honours. In total Moore has played the Masters nine times, missing just two cuts and has finished inside the top-14 four times. Despite a lacklustre season, Moore did post his best ever finish at Augusta this year, finishing T9 and I hope his best finish in this event comes this year also.
Moore  ->  positive

A T2 at the Dean & Deluca a week before a T13 finish at the Memorial Tournament suggests he is finding his better stuff at the right time. The reason Spieth is not dominating as he has in the past is his play with the putter this season. Before, Spieth was just streets above on the greens, but so far this season he ranks just 40th in Strokes Gained: Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Result: MC  Zach Johnson 1pt EW 125/1 with *For the latest bet365 Opening Account Offer details see below. Major Championships aren't won on spreadsheets but Zach Johnson's PGA Tour stats are eye-catching to say the least. The 2007 Masters Champion sits 12th in Scoring Average, 4th in Bogey Avoidance, 25th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 15th in par-4 Scoring Average and 13th in par-5 Scoring Average.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Standard eligibility rankings apply, whilst the following shall first be eligible:  AT&T Pebble Beach winners prior to 2000 and in the last five seasons The Players Championship and major championship winners prior to 2000 and in the last five years  In addition there is no Open Monday Qualifying for this event. Headlining the field is World No.1, Jason Day who is also joined by Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed from the world’s top-10. Day and Johnson will be looking for much better performances than they managed at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, as both players missed the cut in an event they were rightly favourites for.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Surely, he's entitled to be closer to the front of the market and he's a strong each-way fancy. Like the aforementioned Every, Johnson thrives in events such as the Texas Open, the Sony, Colonial and the RBC Heritage, and Kevin Chappell rates an interesting contender having won the former last season. It was a long overdue success for the former Nicklaus Award winner who was considered one of the brightest sparks in US golf when he emerged on the scene, and his rewards for it included a Presidents Cup debut late last year - an experience he'll be keen to repeat in Paris come September.
Johnson  ->  positive

Picks to win  Ryan Moore  I was tempted to pick Tiger Woods here, but -- spoiler alert -- I'll save that one for next week. Instead, the pick is Moore, who arrives at the intersection of form and familiarity. He owns top-10 results in two of his past four starts and finished 18th and third in the past two editions of this tournament.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Kevin Na has also made all four cuts of his Greenbrier career: T36 in 2010, T7 in 2012, T52 in 2014, and T32 in 2015. Tony Finau finished T13 in 2015, his only try at The Old White TPC. Ted Potter, Jr. won in 2012 and followed that up with a T6 in 2013 and T26 in 2014.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Last season, List’s two best finishes of the season came at the CareerBuilder Challenge (T6), where two of the three courses are Pete Dye designs and the Honda Classic (T10) which is also well known for its windy conditions. If List is going to get off the mark on the PGA Tour anytime soon, he is going to want to ride these patches of form he is going through, and he can go again after that T3 finish two weeks ago. A T39 finish here last year was his first full week at Harbour Town, after withdrawing in 2013, where his 36-hole score of +5 would have missed the cut anyway.
List’s  ->  positive

Like Grace, he played well without ever contending. Perez opened with a pair of 74s and, again like Grace, was one of just a dozen players to come up with two sub-par rounds on the weekend. In truth, his strong play at the Masters was a continuation of the good form he's show over the last four or five months.
Perez  ->  positive

Indeed we scored last August when we were on-board at 200/1 at the Wyndham Championship. In total, Every has placed in the FRL market 15 times on the PGA Tour and interestingly Harbour Town Golf Links is his most productive course when it comes to Thursdays: from 6 appearances he's been 4th (2012), 5th (2014) and 1st (2015) after 18 holes. With a lush golf course and green light conditions to go low on Thursday, I can definitely see Every in the mix again.
Every  ->  positive

What that will mean for a mid-length hitter off the tee is that he can swap the driver out off the tee to find better success, and then smoke his irons off good lies to find the green. Casey would be my pick to win, so offers excellent value at only $8100 on DraftKings. He’s had great success at Majors – 34 of 53 cuts made, and nine top-10s – and has looked great this season with a solo 6th at Augusta and a 26th just recently at Erin Hills.
Casey  ->  positive

Should be awesome. Berhow: Dustin Johnson wins at five under, Justin Rose is the runner-up for the second straight major and Mr. Lee Westwood is third. Zak: I've convinced myself that Jason Day will continue his recent solid form and that Erin Hills will play very similar to Whistling Straits (at least for him).
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Tommy Fleetwood – 2 points outright @ 25.0 (lay back 3 points at 5.0)  Bubba Watson – 1 point outright @ 46.0 (lay back 4 points @ 7.0)  Emilliano Grillo – 2 points top 10 @ 5.5  Lucas Glover – 5 points to beat Ryan Moore @ 2.00  Jason Kokrak – 3 points to beat Louis Oosthuizen @ 2.20  Click here for Matchbook’s latest golf markets. Again I’d have Kokrak a marginal favourite based on recent form and think this one has been priced on name recognition. He ranks in the top 34 of both of our key stats and finished last week ranking 8th in strokes gained tee-to-green and 10th in strokes gained around the green so his all round game is clearly in good nick.
Kokrak  ->  positive

2nd here on debut as a rookie in 2014 and the winner here in 2015, East Lake has always been one of those courses which certain players simply 'get'. Spieth is certainly in that camp and despite all of the top 6 in the FedEx Cup standings having legitimate chances in Georgia this week, I think the World Number 2 has all of the tools he needs at his disposal to capture the FEC title for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. When asked in Chicago what he likes about East Lake, Spieth replied: "East Lake and Augusta remind me a lot of each other.
Spieth  ->  positive

And we all know he should have won (or at least made the playoff) at the PGA Championship there if not for a bogus ruling in a bunker on the final hole. Steals  Francesco Molinari ($7,800)  This is a crazy low price for Molinari, who has been on a tear recently. He ranks 1st in my statistical model, mostly thanks to his incredible ball-striking the past few months.
Molinari  ->  positive

Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler. I think all of these names are viable picks this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Has made seven straight cuts with four top-16 finishes entering this week. Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone?
Walker  ->  positive

In total Moore has played the Masters nine times, missing just two cuts and has finished inside the top-14 four times. Despite a lacklustre season, Moore did post his best ever finish at Augusta this year, finishing T9 and I hope his best finish in this event comes this year also. Highlighting his average season are his largely poor stats but one area he does still excel in is Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green ranking T24 which is an additional bonus for me.
Moore  ->  positive

On and on it goes. Jon Rahm, winner of this year’s CareerBuilder boasts numerous combined good finishes in Pheonix and at Houston, whilst last year’s winner round here Adam Hadwin has two top-3 finishes at La Quinta (and a T6), third Dominic Bozzelli finished top-5 at the CareerBuilder, and the two previous winners have form at Houston. Geddit?
Dominic Bozzelli  ->  positive

Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th). Fowler also ranks 13th in Ball Striking and with his well rounded Strokes Gained numbers ranks him 2nd in Strokes Gained: Total, highlighting how good his game is in general this season. After a slow start at Firestone last week, Fowler fired rounds of 67/66 to climb inside the top-10 (9th), continuing his good form and hopefully taking momentum to Charlotte this week.
Fowler  ->  positive

It has two par 5’s, four par 3’s and 12 par 4’s. Previous winners include Heath Slocum (2010), Ben Crane (2011), Tommy Gainey (2012), Chris Kirk (2013), Robert Streb (2014) and Kevin Kisner (2015). The main thing that stands out here is that length is not important, however SGP, greens in regulation and par 4 scoring stats are certainly worth mentioning.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Whilst of course defending champion Dustin Johnson has shown what it takes to get it done round here as well, I just feel that after last week JT is the one with the momentum at the moment and I’m happy to give him the nod. JORDAN SPIETH – 14-1 - 2pts E/W – ¼ odds 1st 5 FINISHED 14th  The next player I like from a price point of view out of the market leaders is Jordan Spieth. Spieth’s troubles which have been mainly on the greens this season have been well documented.
Spieth.  ->  positive

20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total.
Mickelson  ->  positive

He was well behind Spieth's runaway total, but he did finish second in the field in proximity and third in strokes gained putting. And, like Harman, Kisner was in contention throughout at Erin Hills. Cameron Smith - $7,600 (30-1)    Here's a case of the odds not being in sync with the DraftKings price – the oddsmakers like Smith more, and that catches our eye.
Kisner  ->  positive

Adam Scott  ->  positive

Rafa is ultra-consistent, fast becoming a factor in the biggest events, and should really love this test, if his great form in the Dubai Desert Classic is the guide it usually is to this major. Henley needs to build on strong first round showing  Back Russell Henley for a Top 10 Finish 2u @ [10.5]  Another of my 100 Winner picks, Henley has yet to make a top-ten here but is making steady progress towards it. He's improved with each of his four Augusta starts and finished 11th last year.
Henley  ->  positive

He'd sat tied for 22nd and five back after round one. Willett sat tied ninth and four adrift after day one two years ago but 12 months earlier, Spieth and Rose sat first and second after the opening round and that's how they finished the tournament, with Spieth winning wire-to-wire. Bubba took a very typical route to the title in 2014 when he sat in a tie for second, just one off the lead, after opening the event with a three-under par 69 and he was three clear at halfway after a second round 68.
Spieth  ->  positive

Danny Lee  3. Jonas Blixt  MY PICK : Paul Casey ($8,800)  Casey, remarkably, has only one win on US soil thus far in what has otherwise been a very impressive career. While he’s let some opportunities slide by recently, his game is still in top form.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Opens due to the presence of the amateurs and Rory's record in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship (three second places and a third) shows he enjoys a bit of 'giggle golf'. I expect McIlroy to say he's died and gone to heaven when seeing the courses this week. After his strong start to the season, it looks a great venue for him to take the next step and get back into the winner's circle.
McIlroy  ->  positive

He is riding a streak of three finishes of T26 or better and has missed just one cut so far this season. Molinari is fifth in SG Off the Tee and 25th in GIR. With accuracy being a key factor this week, look for Molinari to have another solid outing at Harbour Town.
Molinari  ->  positive

Last year’s winner Dustin Johnson led the year long stats in that range in 2016 and 2015 runner-up Bubba Watson was also very strong in that area when he won. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($10,600): Fowler has played remarkably well ever since February and is probably a tad unlucky he only has one win to his credit thus far. That could easily change at Firestone however, a course where Rickie has finished inside the top ten on four out of seven visits.
Rickie  ->  positive

Walker hasn’t lost strokes to the field on approach shots since last year’s TOUR Championship, and is sixth best in the field on P4s 450-500 yards over his past 24 rounds. Oh, FYI, Walker was recently diagnosed with Lyme Disease. Based on his latest results, it doesn’t seem to be affecting him all that much.
Walker  ->  positive

Last week however in Houston he ranked 18th in SGP and the flat stick particularly clicked for him in his Sunday round of 65. When Henley won the Honda Classic he shot 78 66 in his previous event to miss the cut, however the sign was there from the 66 on the Friday that something had fallen in to place. It would appear therefore that he is the sort of player who takes a momentum on to the next week and if he can do that here, when returning to a venue he has improved at every year, he could well surprise at a big price.
Henley  ->  positive

He has recorded a top 15 at the Honda in five of the last seven years. Longshots:  Wesley Bryan (150-1 to win, 12-1 top 10, 7-1 top 20)  Wesley Bryan enters this week on the back of two missed cuts, so his odds have dropped significantly. Bryan held the 36-hole lead last year en route to a fourth place finish.
Wesley  ->  positive

Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J. Choi, J.B. Holmes and Stewart Cink and you have an event that seems pretty accessible to almost everyone.
Shane Lowry,  ->  positive

Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not. The secondary strength of the field is getting propped up by Francesco Molinari, Scott Piercy, Zach Johnson, Kevin Kisner, Bill Haas, William McGirt, and Kevin Na. Decent names, nothing great.
Bill Haas,  ->  positive

That added to T10 (Texas Open) and T9 (Heritage) in his two previous starts so, without question, the man from Daytona Beach, Florida is playing some excellent golf. Looking at Cauley's scorecards, in Houston he was T10 for Birdies, 6th in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee and 14th in SG: Putting. At Hilton Head, he was T3 for Birdies and 8th for Strokes Gained: Tee to Green.
Cauley's  ->  positive

He's teed it up four times so far on this wraparound schedule and finished 8-27-13 before Christmas and also T9 in last week's CareerBuilder Challenge. The stats show he's been hitting it long and straight in recent times, Laird finishing 8th in Driving Accuracy last week and 2nd and 12th in DA before that. Allied to his length, it makes him a powerful proposition on this course.
Laird  ->  positive

This course is the ideal test for Bohn right now as he looks for a return to form. He has made just 6 of 15 cuts since returning, and his best finish was T35. The trouble is Bohn has struggled, understandably since suffering a heart attack at the Honda Classic last year.
Bohn  ->  positive

Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st. Pair that with the fact that he's the world's number-one ranked golfer, and he's a really tough fade.
DJ's  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson  Five of the Swede’s 11 top 10s in the majors have come in the PGA and that ties in with the idea that he usually plays his best golf in the second half of the season. Stenson has finished 7-25-3-3 in the last four editions of this event and, after a decent defense of the Claret Jug (T11 Open), added T17 at Firestone on Sunday after shooting 70-69 on the weekend. But now the big fly in the ointment.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Expert Picks : Cam Smith, Adam Hadwin, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Luke Donald, Brian Harman, Ian Poulter, Dustin Johnson, Marc Leishman, Brandt Snedeker, Ollie Schniederjans  Professor Picks : Dustin Johnson, Matt Kuchar, Paul Casey, Pat Cantley, Zach Johnson, Austin Cook, Jason Dufner, Kevin Na, Marc Leishman, Ryan Moore  WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS If he's not in your weekly roster, you're doing it wrong. Three runner-ups in the last four years, along with seven top-3 finishes in 12 appearances.

Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches. All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year.
Morgan Hoffmann  ->  positive

Course history truthers will ignore Chez this week as he’s missed a handful of cuts at this course, but he did finish T9 at Sedgefield back in 2011. Reavie has shown he can compete in scoring fests this season, going a combined -58 in four easy tests during the fall swing season (from the Shriners to CareerBuilder), and fits the same mould as Kevin Kisner to a smaller degree:  5 th in Driving Accuracy (71.66%)  in Driving Accuracy (71.66%) Excellent in Approaches above 150 (36 th , 79 th , 19 th )  , 79 , 19 ) 26 th in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 th in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%)  in Par-4 Scoring (4.01) and 54 in Par-4 Birdie or Better (17.32%) 8 th in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 th in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%)  in Par-3 Scoring (2.98) and 18 in Par-3 Birdie or Better (17.13%) 1st in Proximity to the Hole  The one area Reavie has struggled has been with the flatstick in hand, losing 0.940 strokes in 99 events played on Bermuda, but he’s actually had a much better season in that regard; Reavie is 64th in SG: Putting overall and a spectacular 16th in 3-Putt avoidance, but he does struggle outside 10 feet. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Brian Gay ($7300): On an easy track that basically amounts to a proximity and putting contest, there are few better putters worth a punt than Brian Gay – Gay has gained 1.785 strokes putting on Bermuda (1.663 elsewhere).
Chez  ->  positive

Zach Johnson: Prior to last year’s 54th-place finish, ZJ had six straight finishes of 26th or better, including a runner-up finish in 2012. Johnson’s 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks third among golfers with more than one start at TPC Sawgrass. Zach’s 61.3 LT SC percentage ranks 21st, his 13.9 LT Adj Bird Avg is 30th, and his 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score is tied for 36th.
Johnson:  ->  positive

Key Stats:  Ball Striking  Strokes Gained Tee to Green  Par 4 Scoring  Strokes Gained: Approach  Strokes Gained: Putting  Greenbrier Classic Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Bill Haas (DK: $10,800, FD: $8,800)    Weak field events are Haas’s jam, and we get another one this week. Haas enters the Greenbrier in good form, as he’s made four straight cuts with no finish worse than 25th. His approaches, putting and Par-4 scoring have all been good over that time frame, and all are stats which we will want to target this week.
Haas  ->  positive

As for iron play, Fowler sits a very healthy 7th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green while he's 12th in Approaches from over 200 yards. Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio. That's the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC, a long par 70 with testing par 4s, and Fowler has cracked the top 10 in his last three appearances there.
Fowler  ->  positive

Since winning the Masters in April, Garcia has been able to back that win up with some strong play, including a T2 finish in his last start at the BMW International. Although he broke his major goose-egg at Augusta, it is the Open which has always been Garcia’s favorite major, as he has an incredible 10 finishes of T10 or better at this event since 2001. While younger players like Rahm and Spieth certainly come in with confidence, the Open has been an experienced player’s paradise recently with the last six winners all being 39 years of age or older.
Garcia  ->  positive

DJ also ranked 26th in SG:App last season which helped him rank third overall in tee-to-green strokes. Johnson is coming in hot after finishing runner-up at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship last week and sixth in the Tournament of Champions three weeks ago. He was 13th at the Farmers last season and finished third in 2011.
Johnson  ->  positive

5th for Greens in Regulation and 4th for Strokes Gained Approach last week in Los Angeles, I think a motivated Justin will take all the stopping this week.

He missed the cut in the Irish Open last time but, against that negative, he posted a top 10 in France two starts ago and was T18 at Augusta National. Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

Indeed, given that he didn’t play a World Golf Championship in 2013 or 2014, three starts prior coming when he was not yet ready, he’s effectively hit the frame in three attempts from seven. Such numbers only take us so far and it’s quite clear that Willett has endured an up-and-down 10 months since taking advantage of an opportunity handed to him by Jordan Spieth at Augusta. Right now, he’s still bedding in some swing changes and in some part they help explain his poor display as 54-hole leader in Malaysia two starts ago, where he barely scraped a place after a closing 73 having led by three shots with a round to go.
Willett  ->  positive

ET on Thursday, April 5  Eighty-plus players are invited to tee off at Augusta, and you know who’s going to be there. Tiger, Phil, DJ, Bubba, Sergio, Spieth and the complete list of the world’s Top 50 players. Plus, a slew of amateurs, all the PGA winners from the last calendar year, Indian wunderkind Shubhankar Sharma, and a ton of the world’s best players from, like, 30 years ago.
Spieth  ->  positive

7th at El Camaleon, 8th at Waialae, 2nd at Torrey Pines and play-off loser 2 weeks ago at TPC Potomac, Charles is certainly trending in the right direction and his record on resort scoring tests and here at Deere Run is decent enough. 2nd in Actual Scoring Average, 1st in Bogey Avoidance, and 29th in Proximity to Hole are season-long statistics upon which you can build a real challenge for the John Deere Classic and Howell, who's ranked in the top 50 for Strokes Gained Tee to Green for the past 4 seasons, has also added some cutting edge with the putter of late. 44th in Putting Average, 49th in Strokes Gained Putting and 15th in my 10-week Putting Average tracker is worth taking note of, especially as he ranks 1st in my Greens in Regulation tracker as well.
Charles  ->  positive

Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average. The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Horschel clearly loves this course and he’s kind of due for a victory since his last one coming in the 2014 Tour Championship.
Horschel  ->  positive

Woods of course has eight wins here (including 2008 U.S Open) and Phil Mickelson has three wins in the event itself. It has been an up and down start for Snedeker so far in the 2016/17 season. He has finished T6 at the Hero World Challenge and T12 at the Tournament of Champions but missed the cut at the Sony Open, so a mixed bag thus far.
Snedeker  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth 7/1  I don’t know what it is about Augusta but it seems to really suit Jordan Spieth. Despite missing the cut last week in Houston, Spieth has been in great form with a win and five top 25’s in his last seven starts. He started 2017 off with a T3 at the SBS Tournament of Champions and followed that with a T9 in Phoenix, a win in Pebble Beach, T22 at The Genesis Open and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

I don't think we need to go stars and scrubs this week in cash games but Rickie makes a very high upside GPP play and is the only player on my sheet to rank Top 10 in all four categories. Billy Horschel  World Golf Ranking (#81)  Vegas Odds (110/1)  Draftkings ($7,100)  FanDuel ($8,400)  If you are looking to take a risk and go a bit contrarian this week consider Billy Horschel. He comes back to PGA National with back to back Top 10 finishes in 2017 and 2016 but could be lower owned as the form has been pretty bad lately as he is coming off back to back missed cuts.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

: Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 ) and greens (20 ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor.
Henley  ->  positive

Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
Reed  ->  positive

LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th. At best however if you catch Lucas on the right week, in tough conditions, with ball striking at a premium and a few putts drop, he is still a class act and can get right in the hunt and, as a three time winner on tour including a US Open, he does know how to win a golf tournament!
LUCAS GLOVER  ->  positive

Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career. I have fond memories of collecting on Horschel three years ago at 20/1 and Leishman looks well worth chancing at a slightly bigger price. Selection:  Marc Leishman @ [22.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with my Portugal Masters preview.
Leishman  ->  positive

But so many of the recent US Open winners are ultra-talented, big-hitting players with cool temperaments, who do everything well. That would certainly describe Fowler, who also sits 1st in the All-Around stats which measure driving, irons, bunker play, putting, scoring and birdie/eagle ranking. So, could Fowler be the latest to debunk the myth that you have to be a renowned straight hitter to win the US Open?
Fowler,  ->  positive

Looking at the same rolling report for Strokes Gained: Around the Green, Dufner ranks 19th, 34th, 15th, and 9th over his last 4, 8, 12, and 24 rounds here. Also using Fantasy National Golf Club, we notice that Dufner is an excellent wind player and with this week's forecast, that will be key. Top Current Form Targets  Byeong Hun An  World Golf Ranking (#86)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($9,400)    In the form section, I will be highlighting multiple players who bounced back in a big way after back to back missed cuts earlier in the season.
Dufner  ->  positive

Can’t make this stuff up. Still, despite bleeding strokes to the field on the putting surfaces in four of his past six starts, List has piled up six consecutive Top 30s, with two Top-10 paydays. It’s about getting to the green for List.
List  ->  positive

Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here.
Reed  ->  positive

Donald’s most recent win came in Japan back in 2013, and whilst he has not won in America since 2012, Fitzpatrick can certainly draw inspiration from his career so far. Fitzpatrick tweeted Monday evening saying “Now onto my favourite week of the year @RBC_Heritage”. Whether it be the fact he finished so well here as an amateur three years ago or just the fact they invited him during his time as amateur, who knows, but it can only be a positive that he speaks so highly of the event.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

the RSM Classic winner, Austin Cook, is an interesting debutant at a big price and Kevin Streelman, who currently ranks third for Scrambling and second for GIR, was third here in 2013.

We’re down to 15 so now we can get serious! The Contenders  Here are the remaining 15 players, in order of how I priced their winning chances:  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Louis Oosthuizen  Brandt Snedeker  Shane Lowry  Ian Poulter  Zach Johnson  JB Holmes  Hideto Tanihara  From these I’ve derived my following tips:  Tip #1 - Winner  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Tip #2 - Top5  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Tip #3 - Top10  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Tip #4 - Top20  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Tip #5 - Top South African  Louis Oosthuizen  Tip #6 - Top USA  Rickie Fowler  Brandt Snedeker  Summary  Sergio Garcia should win; Rickie Fowler the closest challenger;  Rose & Matsuyama can be expected to go well without quite making it;  Stenson & Scott should safely place Top10;  Casey & Leishman can be relied upon as Top20 bets;  Snedeker, for me, ranks a value-reeking 2nd in the Top USA market, behind Fowler;  Oosthuizen should easily be Top South African;  Best longshot - take your pick(s) among: Lowry,Poulter, Zach JB & Tanihara.

Champ makes his second appearance of the week. He is a long shot, but we are certainly willing to take a shot at this low price.
Champ  ->  positive

Two of my three picks did make the cut (Kisner, Kaymer), but both struggled on the weekend; however, I did spot on nail my BUST pick of the week on previously red hot Jon Rahm, as he imploded on Saturday and failed to secure a Sunday tee time with his MDF finish. Now, let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLA (Last week: Kaymer t-69th)    Jordan Spieth– Looking purely at his end finish results and you might think that Spieth has struggled here. But, don’t forget that Jordan was the man to beat heading into Sunday here last year, after opening rounds of 64-65-67, before imploding to a Sunday 75 for a t-18th finish.
Jordan  ->  positive

Perez looked good at Augusta and has a good track record at Harbour Town. Russell Henley and Pat Perez. Henley is on a roll after a win in Houston and T-11 at Augusta National.
Perez.  ->  positive

RELATED: 13 picks to win the PGA Championship  And for those of you playing other fantasy golf formats:  Yahoo! lineup: Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm (Starters); Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Charley Hoffman, Brooks Koepka (Bench). Knockout/One-and-done pick: Rickie Fowler.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Kuchar is an excellent discount play over Stenson this week. Bill Haas ($9,200) – Another guy on tour who is pretty much the definition of “ho hum”, Haas is (generally) consistent, patient, and effective tee-to-green. Some courses are just going to be too big for him, but a place like Copperhead is where he can thrive, evidenced by his playoff runner-up finish last year.
Haas  ->  positive

He won’t be over-owned because of an egregious miss price but also provides enough upside to stomach paying that price. Casey is one of my favorite bets on the board this week at 50-1 and is my early lean for a One and Done selection. Brandt Snedeker – $7,600  Your free space for the week is Brandt Snedeker.
Casey  ->  positive

Putting is clearly of lesser importance here, as the greens are flat and allow even shaky putters to look graceful with the flat stick -- think Hideki Matsuyama, Kevin Stadler, and two-time runner-up Bubba Watson. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12500 – Spieth’s unparalleled putting gets the headlines, but last year he was second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, a major ingredient to success at TPC Scottsdale. Spieth is obviously great at all aspects of the game and can win anywhere, but his combination of smarts and talent should net him his third top-10 finish in as many starts in Scottsdale this week.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Hudson Swafford  Vegas Odds - 80/1  Draftkings - $7,800  FantasyAces - $4,950    Like Steele, Hudson Swafford has played here both years that Silverado CC has hosted the tournament(formerly known as FRYS.com Open). He is the only golfer(Steele was close) in the field to finish both inside the Top 20 with a 17th last year and 8th the year before. He also hits in the stats department with rankings of 31st in SG: OTT, 56th in SG: APP, 29th in overall Proximity, 34th & 28th in Par 4/5 scoring and 19th in BoB%.
Steele,  ->  positive

Update: With a weather draw potentially favoring golfers that play Spyglass on Saturday, I'm going to make a late change. My new pick will be Patrick Cantlay who ranks 30th in weighted course history but ranks 9th over long-term skill. He ranks #2 behind Jon Rahm (already used) when isolating golfers that will play Splyglass on Saturday.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Pat Perez – $7,400  Pat Perez stuck out as one of the best values on the board, and a great option to pair with DJ in your builds. Perez has been all over the map to start the 2018 season, making an odd trip to Dubai in the middle of the west coast swing. His results haven’t been great, but he is making cuts and gaining strokes in the key categories.
Perez  ->  positive

Holmes is a past winner at Quail Hollow with his triumph in the 2014 Wells Fargo Championship. Holmes isn’t in the greatest of form, but he has two top-15 finishes in his last four starts, with a 14th at the RBC Canadian Open and a ninth at the Greenbrier Classic. He had two good rounds at Firestone in the WGC-Bridgestone, including a final-round 67 to get a silver lining out of a bad weekend.
Holmes  ->  positive

On his promotion to the PGA Tour this autumn, Spaun acclimatised slowly to the higher level, but his best result by far came at El Camaleon where he finished 28th and he showed his liking for Paspalum greens by topping the Putts per GIR category that week. Harold Varner III 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  There's a massive difference of opinion over Harold Varner III this week with Paddy Power and Betfair pricing him as short as 35/1. The very early 80/1 in the market has rightfully been snapped up, but with the price history of this event 66/1 with HV3 is not a bad place to be this week.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

He’s also been impressive at the CareerBuilder in recent years, finishing T3-T14 in 2017 and 2016. Cauley is top-12 on Tour in both SG: Tee-to-Green and SG: Putting this season, while he’s also 26th in terms of proximity. Chris Kirk - $14,500    Kirk has posted back-to-back top-10 finishes heading into the CareerBuilder Challenge, where he notched a top-25 result in 2017.
Cauley  ->  positive

(Not that he'd show up, but still quite the question.) For now, we are left with a still-pretty-dang-intriguing tournament at Kapalua, with seven of the top eight in the OWGR on hand, including the top-five: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Hideki Matsuyama. Not too shabby.
Justin Thomas,  ->  positive

The average ranking was 10.6, so a top-15 ranking in Greens in Regulation and Scrambling looks to be part of the recipe this week. Market Leaders  Dustin Johnson (11/2)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Jordan Spieth (14/1)  Justin Thomas (18/1)  Phil Mickelson (28/1)  Selections  Chez Reavie 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Chez Reavie finished T2 for the second week in a row last week at Pebble Beach and has finished inside the top-24 in 9 of his last 10 events (T36 finish at the CareerBuilder the anomaly). His last missed cut came at the RBC Heritage last April, which is quite an extraordinary run from the 36-year old.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama. Whilst Day couldn’t get the job done on his last start, I think he has shown enough to contend again, at a course he should enjoy. Despite Day seemingly struggling for most of the season, Day still ranks a very impressive 2nd in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green and that is particularly pleasing ahead of this event.
Day  ->  positive

Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course. It's no wonder he has a stellar track record in major championships.
Spieth  ->  positive

The Field  The field this week is loaded with potential Augusta contenders and players who will be trying to get the outright win and book their last minute ticket to the year’s first major. Elite players with something to prove like Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson will all be using this week to prepare for Augusta, while others like Charles Howell III, Tony Finau and Billy Horschel will all be chasing a win and the last potential spot into the Masters. Last week’s second place finisher from the match play event, Jon Rahm, will also be in attendance giving DraftKings players plenty of talent to choose from.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Have a good feeling about a guy who is long off the tee and can make birdies in bunches. DraftKings bargain: Stewart Cink ($7,000). T-17 or better in two of three CIMB starts, and barely missed out on making it to East Lake last season.
Stewart Cink  ->  negative

As with our first two picks this week it’s again hard not to see another big week for the Swede ahead. EMILIANO GRILLO – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 26th    I backed Grillo in this event last year and he duly lead the event on day one before sitting one shot of the pace at halfway. After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils.
EMILIANO GRILLO  ->  positive

He won the title beating the favourite in the final - one Patrick Cantlay. That final was played in windy conditions and one look at Kraft's professional CV tells you he has no issues in technical conditions or by the coast. So if this gets pretty gnarly across the weekend I can see Kelly progressing along ok, especially if my assumption of a -17/18 winning total is correct.
Kelly  ->  positive

Casey had similar finishes (T11 and T13) so, again, there's no way the Aussie should be two-and-a-half times the price. Going into the BMW, Leishman is a very healthy seventh in the FedEx Cup standings after he took another big leap with third place at TPC Boston last time. Leishman got himself in a great position to win the tournament before a poor tee-shot at 10 set him off on the wrong path coming home but it's hard to be too down about a top three.
Leishman  ->  positive

Fowler’s record here is almost as good as Matsuyama’s, as he has two runner-up finishes in eight starts at this event and was T4 last year as well. Outside of Rickie, other possible low-owned plays include Byeong-Hun An ($8,000; led here by three shots last year with nine holes to play), Russell Henley ($7,600), Zach Johnson ($7,700), Peter Uihlein ($6,800) and Emiliano Grillo ($7,200), who was sixth in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green last week. Top Strokes Gained: Tee to Green from Last Week  1.
Peter Uihlein  ->  positive

Initial thoughts are 'probably not' but he does have a second (Scottish Open) and a 10th (Irish Open) on windy links and also recent knowledge that he can take on the best after finishing runner-up in the US PGA. Tommy Fleetwood - 25/1  The market may just be underestimating Fleetwood here. He's the new European No.1 and topped the greens in regulation stats when enjoying that new status with a tied sixth place in last week's Hong Kong Open.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

When he’s not gaining off-the-tee, he’s making those shots up with really good scrambling ability. Bottom line, Streelman makes cuts and doesn’t make bogeys. He has decent upside as well, sprinkling in three Top 10 finishes across his 13 made cuts this year.
Streelman  ->  positive

Finally another point that caught my eye is that Kirk has a top 5 finish at the Nicklaus designed Muirfield village host of the Memorial, an event which has been won by Dufner and Lingmerth over recent years, who finished 1st & 2nd in this event respectively in 2016. RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open.
RUSSELL KNOX  ->  positive

Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month. Stenson is tied for fifth with his 68.4 LT Adj Rd Score and ranks fourth with his 15.8 LT Adj Bird Avg.
Stenson  ->  positive

I would personally instead prefer to start in the $10K range and target players like Jason Day (five top-tens in six US Opens), Rickie Fowler ($10,500) and Jon Rahm ($10,300). Going down further some other solid cash game targets include Paul Casey ($8,400), Louis Oosthuizen ($7,400), Francesco Molinari ($7,000), Peter Uihlein ($6,900) and Marc Leishman ($6,700). Tournaments: Even with the two missing the cut at the Memorial, I would still expect Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm to soak up a lot of ownership this week.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

68-68 was good enough for 13th after 36 holes, but Schauffele ultimately needs a more open course where he can use his undoubted strengths. 16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. RESULT: T73  Chesson Hadley 2pts EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*.
Billy Horschel,  ->  positive

The Tiers  $12,000 - $10,000  CASH: He was our GPP play last week but this week for cash I am going straight to the top with Jordan Spieth. Spieth comes into Pebble with great form having posted a 9th last week after getting off to a rocky start was able to find his groove and surge on the weekend with two prior 3rd places in the fall.. Jordan's game is well suited for this event and he is sneaky long enough to hit the big par 5's in two. After getting his irons and wedges dialed in on the weekend at the Waste Management, I'm confident he will be throwing darts on this rain soften course.
Jordan Spieth.  ->  positive

Honda Classic  Defending Champ: Adam Scott  FNTSY Sports Network’s Pat Mayo & Derek Farnsworth discuss their favorite Honda Classic DraftKings picks. The guys preview the course, debate the best roster construction for the week and explain which players are best suited for DFS cash games and which should be deployed in guaranteed prize pool (GPP) tournaments. Honda Classic Field  144 Players | Top 70 & Ties After 36-Holes Make the Cut  The PGA’s shift from the West Coast to the East means we’re dealing with new types of grass, different gusts of winds, and, most importantly, the removal of the Thursday safety net for filling out our lineups.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

I won't miss Perez later in the year, so Pat Perez will be my pick. They didn't pop in the history + baseline method but golfers like Austin Cook, Cameron Smith, and Marc Leishman all pop in the recent form and course fit department. I think all three of them make for solid OAD picks, as well.
Cameron Smith,  ->  positive

I’m expecting further improvement this year as he will have learned a lot from that and he closed with a 69 giving him the all-important round in the 60s. Steele also finished inside the top 20 in the WGC Mexico which is always a good pointer to where the long-game is at for a tilt at the Masters. That long game assurance is backed up by a very impressive stats profile as he ranks 7th in GIR, 19th in bogey avoidance, 10th in par 4 scoring, 7th in strokes gained: off the tee and 35th in strokes gained: approaches.
Steele  ->  positive

Kizzire has taken 11 events, whilst Thomas has done it in just 8, but it is an impressive effort nonetheless. Kizzire missed the cut on debut here last year, but as stated earlier mediocre course form can be overcome, it is the experience that is vital. Returning a better player this time around, Kizzire will be keen to improve in an event that could well suit now his game is in better shape.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Enter Lahiri, who is currently ranked fourth in Birdie Average, ninth in Birdie or Better Percentage and 16th in par four Birdie or Better Percentage. In short, Lahiri can pile up the DK points fast when he’s on and looks like he’ll be a great fit for a course which is typically one of the most lenient on tour in terms of scoring. When you add in his recent form (T2 at Memorial) and the fact he is coming off 10 days of “meditation” according to his Twitter account (@anirbangolf), he makes for a very interesting play this week in DFS and one that could yield a ton of DK points if things go well.
Lahiri,  ->  positive

Kirk hasn’t missed a cut at this event in his last six starts, and his 68.6 Course Adj Rd Score ranks fourth among golfers with more than one start at this track. Kirk had struggled this season, but he finished 12th in his last time out at THE PLAYERS Championship. Humpnostication  Hump’s prognostication machine has been pretty brutal, so take this with a grain of salt (or whatever else would make you approach its potential validity with caution).
Kirk  ->  positive

Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks. He is third in the field in SG:APP, seventh in SG:ATG, sixth in Par 4 Scoring, fourth in Bogey Avoidance, ninth in Scrambling and first in Birdie or Better %.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

His game has also been pretty hot in the last few months. While not as potent as Simpson here, Johnson has top 15s the last three years in Phoenix. He’s subtly been one of the most high-producing consistent golfers in the world of late, with finishes between T-8 and T-23 in his last six starts.
Johnson  ->  positive

In addition of course it means we are getting 66-1 about a player who clearly loves the event and I’m happy to take a chance at that price that the return to La Quinta will reignite his game. DAVID LINGMERTH – 66-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 57th  Finally I will close my selections for this week by weighing in with David Lingmerth in this event for the third year running. I still wake up with the occasional nightmare about ‘Duf’s shot of the rocks here in 2016, which basically cost me a 66-1 winner on Lingmerth!
DAVID LINGMERTH  ->  positive

Luke List  MY PICK : Hideki Matsuyama ($10,200)  Hideki’s form has turned around of late as he’s now finished inside the top-15 in each of his last three starts, and he looks to be close to the level of play which vaulted him up the world rankings in late 2016. Matsuyama ranks second in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee this season and is also second on tour in Par 4 Scoring, two stats which line him up for a nice week at Firestone. While Hideki has never finished better than 12th in four starts at this event, he has won in Ohio before at Muirfield Village, a venue that definitely shares a few traits with this week’s course.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Naturally on his last outing in late November, Jon won his biggest title to date when securing the DP World Tour Championship. The European Tour finale since 2012 had always been won by a player with a previous top-7 finish, but Rahm showed his true world class by winning on course debut - taking the opportunity when Justin Rose collapsed on the back 9. Rahm is so good and so talented that he bucks trends, simple as that.
Rahm  ->  positive

Taylor was seven adrift after the opening round last year and Mickelson managed to win in 2012 having been nine off the lead after day one! It's perfectly possible to win from off the pace with a round to go too and in addition to Taylor last year, who trailed by six, we've also seen Tiger Woods win from five strokes adrift, Phil Mickelson six, and in 2001, Davis Love III won from seven back. If you're betting in-running on Sunday, be very wary of the par five 14th hole, as it's far from a certain birdie hole.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke. Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13

Our statistics expert has picked these three players for you selection. Pick of the favourites: Henrik Stenson  View player profile  The reigning Race to Dubai champion has started 2017 as he finished 2016 with two top tens including a runner-up finish in Dubai in his last appearance. Going further back, the Swede has finished inside the top ten in eight of his last 11 starts worldwide and has four top tens in his last six WGC strokeplay events.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Last year's winner, Jon Rahm, was runner-up in the Canadian Open in 2016, Jhonattan Vegas, who's won the last two editions of the Canadian Open, finished third here on debut in 2011, Farmers winners, Jason Day and Bubba Watson finished one and two in Canada in 2015, and recent Glen Abbey winners, Brandt Snedeker and Tiger Woods are multiple Torrey Pines winners. I recognise that one could argue that Woods, Day, Watson, Snedeker and Rahm are just high quality players that can win anywhere but in addition to those five and Vegas of course, it's also worth highlighting that the 2009 winner of the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey, Nathan Green, who was a huge outsider, also finished runner-up at Torrey Pines in 2006 at a massive price. Is There an Identikit Winner  Stallings was something of an anomaly and although a multiple PGA Tour winner, Ben Crane couldn't be described as top-class but every other winner going right back to the last century has been straight out of the top drawer.
Jhonattan Vegas,  ->  positive

THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row. Charley loves Texas, but I really think that blow-up at Augusta will be on his mind for some time – at 40-years-old, he really isn’t going to get many more chances to win a major.
Matt Kuchar  ->  negative

He already has a win at Torrey Pines followed by a T2 at Pebble Beach to his name this year though, so I have no concerns about his form in general. A two-time winner of this event, who has already won this year it is incredibly easy to make a case for Day and that’s why I will not go on for too long. Form figures of 1-T2-T22 in 2018 suggest he is in fine form, despite some average iron play, so he can easily win an event he loves, in a format he dominates.
Day  ->  positive

Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event. This time around, he’s up to a career-best 11th in the OWGR and has finished top-six five times in his last six starts.
Johnson  ->  positive

A past winner here, Henley is a threat. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Russell Knox - $9,000 Rafa Cabrera Bello - $8,000 Russell Henley - $7,900 Thomas Pieters - $7,700 Keegan Bradley - $7,600 Ollie Schniederjans - $7,600  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar. It's easy to wait on Kuchar since he's so consistent week-to-week.
Chris Kirk,  ->  positive

Ollie Schniederjans at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) – nice opportunity to add his name to the list of young PGA Tour winners  1pt e.w. Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Rory for the win. Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (18/1)  Draftkings ($9,300)  FanDuel ($9,200)  Whether you are fading the top three players or looking to pair one of them with a high-end value, Rickie Fowler makes perfect sense. He is in the low $9K range on both sites and compared to his Vegas odds is a +3 value this week.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

The way he bounced back from his day-two showing with a 69-71 over the weekend showed the consistency and resiliency you need to consider him in every other kind of contest as well. Mid-Priced  Harris English ($8,700) – He has never missed a cut here, and he’s been inside the top-15 three separate times. That’s a solid enough course history to make him a great cash game consideration, and one you should feel even more comfortable with coming off his T14 last weekend.
Harris English  ->  positive

Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout. Kevin Na: Easily the most underappreciated talent on the PGA Tour, Kevin Na lost four strokes to the field putting across the week (including five in his first round en route to a three-under 68) but compensated for that with an absolutely ridiculous 7.1 strokes gained on approach and 5.52 (!)
Rahm:  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should. It’s not a bad price, but the likely ownership, less than stellar form and lack of success at Riviera leads us to fade him completely.
Finau  ->  negative

The upwardly mobile World Number 23 arrives in Honolulu with impressive form which reads 3(ToC)-3(QBE ShootOut)-4(RSM Classic)-8(HSBC Champions)-5(CJ Cup) - all that is missing is his 3rd PGA Tour victory. That could easily come at Waialae, where Harman has shot 15 of his last 16 rounds under par, including a 64, 65 and a pair of 66s. Brian featured in the final group here in 2015 - 3 shots back from eventual winner Jimmy Walker - and commented after a Saturday -6/64 "There's a lot of local knowledge that goes into this place, so just knowing the course a little bit better is key.
Brian  ->  positive

Add to this that he ranks T14 in Par 5 Scoring Average and he certainly has the right profile to win here. Harman does rely fairly heavily on his putting at times, but he does everything he needs to do well enough to win here and that’s why I think he is clearly overpriced at 40/1. In six starts at Bay Hill, Harman has literally been 50/50, missing three cuts, countered by three top-17’s.
Harman  ->  positive

Although it’s not an impact stat in relation to finish position, distance has a very strong relationship to birdie-making, which will be important on an easy course. The one area where Hagy has struggled immensely is on approach, and that’s essentially the reason his price is where it is – he sits 182nd and loses strokes to the field. Hagy could be this week’s Luke List, who doesn’t finish well but scores tremendously.
Hagy  ->  positive

5th for Greens in Regulation and 4th for Strokes Gained Approach last week in Los Angeles, I think a motivated Justin will take all the stopping this week. RESULT: Winner  Brandt Snedeker 1.5pts EW 55/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds): - read our Betfair golf betting review here . Brandt Snedeker fits the bill pretty perfectly.
Justin  ->  positive

Fowler's ability to produce in great fields and aggressive putting style should fare well at Glen Oaks this week. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Jon Rahm, $8900 – The powerful youngster made his name known this season with a win at Torrey Pines, another long layout with poa annua greens. Rahm ranks fifth in Strokes Gained: Total on the PGA Tour and can easily find himself in contention should he keep his emotions in check.
Rahm,  ->  positive

Charley Hoffman: Unlike Leishman, Hoffman made a weekend charge at the U.S. Open, finishing in eighth place. Hoffman is tied for 18th with his 69.4 LT Adj Rd Score, tied for seventh with his impressive 68.3 Recent Adj Rd Score, and tied for sixth with his 15.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg. Additionally, Charley has two top-10 finishes at this event in his last four trips, and he hasn’t finished worse than 26th in that time.
Charley  ->  positive

Andrew Landry ($8,100 | 160) - Spending down on too many options probably isn't necessary this week when we need only six golfers, so don't go too heavy on the punt plays. But you can consider Landry, who finished fourth at the RSM in his most recent action. Prior to that, he withdrew at the OHL and missed the cut at the Shriners.
Andrew Landry  ->  positive

I also like Bud Cauley ($8,500) here for a bounce back at an easier venue. Other potential tournament targets for me here include David Hearn ($8,100), Johnson Wagner ($7,500), Roberto Castro ($6,500) and Chris Stroud ($6,800). Top Recent Form  1.
Roberto Castro  ->  positive

The following is the top 10 in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round over the last two years: Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Bill Haas, Branden Grace, Kevin Na, Martin Kaymer, Ryan Palmer, Marc Leishman, and Brandt Snedeker). Golfers that raise the flag for course history and long-term skill include: Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar, Branden Grace, and Kevin Na. While Furyk and Grace are the past two champs here, they aren't playing up to their standards right now, so I will pass.
Matt Kuchar,  ->  positive

Thomas finished third here last year and should be able to take easy advantage of the scoring holes with his T2G potential on easier courses. MID TIER  Tony Finau ($8,600) – He may have given us quite the scare at the Memorial before his insane hero charge to make the cut on the last three holes, but I expect that Finau will have a much easier time doing some serious damage on a course that should play dramatically easier than Muirfield. Like the other two noted, expect him to overpower this course with a great shot at being in the weekend mix.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

No clue what sort of Zurich exposure I will have .. Looking forward to see how they price the field but I want ALL the Berger/Pieters
Berger/Pieters  ->  positive

£100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Kevin Streelman is always a dangerous player on any low scoring course where outright power is not the be-all and end-all. On a great run of form across his past 4 events which reads 18(Colonial)-13(Muirfield)-8(TPC River Highlands)-17(TPC Potomac), Streelman has a host of top results across resort-level scoring assignments. 3rd at Kapalua in 2015 (-17/275), 1st at TPC River Highlands in 2014 (-15/265), a couple of 8th place finishes at the John Deere Classic (2009/2012), 2nd at TPC Summerlin in 2014 (-18/266) and 4th at El Camaleon this season (-17/267) jump off the page.
Streelman  ->  positive

A look at the course would be beneficial though, given the tough nature of the course and event. Market Leaders  Jordan Spieth (9/1)  Rory McIlroy (14/1)  Sergio Garcia (18/1)  Justin Rose (20/1)  Henrik Stenson (22/1)  Selections  Tony Finau 33/1 (Coral 7 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Tony Finau has been playing to a very high standard this season, and cannot be far away from winning that elusive 2nd PGA Tour title. Finau ranks highly in multiple areas this season, including top-25 in SG: Approach, Par-3 Scoring Average and Par-5 Scoring Average, all key areas this week.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

This time around though, he had no horrific rounds, he was just steady all week long (69-71-70-70). Again 12 months ago, Harman put together a familiar week finishing T13, two shots shy of Hudson Swafford and Tommy Fleetwood in 10th. If Harman, who has played the best golf of his career over the last two years can just shave a shot a round off his usual scoring here, there’s every chance he contends and there is no reason to doubt that he can do that here.
Harman  ->  positive

Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.
Furyk  ->  negative

My hopes are that this price will keep ownership down on a golfer who has three straight top ten finishes, and two straight top 25 finishes at this event. The other interesting golfer that shows up on the OWGR vs. Salary chart is Yuta Ikeda. I’ll be the first to raise my hand and admit I don’t really know this golfer at all, however a quick google search shows that Ikeda has a win on the Asian tour in every year between 2009 and 2016 racking up a total of sixteen wins internationally.
Ikeda.  ->  positive

Johnson led the field in Strokes Gained: Putting last week at Firestone, which always bodes well heading into major week and if the rest of the game clicks this week, he could well get his third major victory and be just one step away (U.S. Open) from the Grand Slam. Looking purely at his stats throughout the season, Johnson has been having a terrible year, ranking 72nd in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green, 86th in Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee and 119th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green. His short game stats (25th SG: Around-The-Green and 44th SG: Putting) are his only real saving grace statistically, but should his upturn in form continue, these stats should improve greatly.
Johnson  ->  positive

. Course Adj Rd Score (count of at least two): 67.7, Paul Casey ($9,500)  Casey has been on an absolute tear recently. His back-to-back second-place finishes and triple-digit DraftKings scores are sure to make him a popular pick going forward.
Casey  ->  positive

10th in Strokes Gained Putting, 4th in Putting Average and 3rd in my 10-week Putting Average tracker all help immeasurably. Harman has always been the sort who performs well on shorter set-ups. Even this season he finished 3rd at PGA West with a -18/270 total.
Harman  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  One year ago, Spieth missed the cut at the first two playoff events, only to win the Tour Championship and still claim the FedEx Cup. He learned a lesson from that: It's not how you start the playoffs; it's how you finish 'em.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough. English has not only put up 6-of-6 made cuts, he’s finished inside the top-15 three times at TPC Scottsdale! Now, English did underperform last year, but he’s a two-time PGA Tour winner with youth and upside to bounce back.
English  ->  positive

Day’s 62.1 LT SC percentage ranks fourth, and he is tied for sixth overall with his 15.1 LT Adj Bird Avg. Adam Scott: Scott hasn’t played here since 2014, when he finished fourth. Scott’s 70.7 LT GIR percentage is fourth, and his 15.0 LT Adj Bird Avg is eighth.
Scott:  ->  positive

Patrick Cantlay  Ben Coley provides a group-by-group guide to the WGC-Match Play Championship, with three each-way bets recommended. Group 1 Dustin Johnson  Kevin Kisner  Adam Hadwin  Bernd Wiesberger The draw for the defending champion could hardly have been kinder. Of the players in Pool B, few have been struggling as badly as Kevin Kisner of late - the fact that these struggles have taken place on courses so well suited to his game is particularly disconcerting.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

: Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 ) and greens (20 ) and has had a lights out putter all year. Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor.
Henley  ->  positive

In 2015, eventual champion Justin Thomas flirted with a 59 before going on to win the event at an astonishing -26. LAST FIVE WINNERS  2016 – Justin Thomas -23 (over Hideki Matsuyama -20)  2015 — Justin Thomas -26 (over Adam Scott -25)  2014 — Ryan Moore -17 (over Gary Woodland -16)  2013 — Ryan Moore -14 (playoff over Gary Woodland)  2012 — Nick Watney -22 (over Robert Garrigus -21)  WINNING TRENDS  Three of the last five winners were playing in this event for the first time  Both the first- and second-place finishers in this event over the past three years have ranked inside the top-50 in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Each of the past four winners had already played in at least one fall-swing season event  STATISTICS  Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Birdie or Better Average  Par 4 Scoring  This event is very much about going low and a winning score in the -20s won’t be shocking. The past four winners here have all ranked either first or second in the week for Birdie or Better Percentage, making this a stat to target.
Gary Woodland  ->  positive

Course & Field Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Yet another #SeaIslandMafia underboss, Matt Kuchar leads the high-priced tier and is tied for third in the field with a 14.8 LT Adj Bird Avg. Kuchar’s 68.5 LT Adj Rd Score is the best in the field, and he’s tied for second with Brandt Snedeker with 5.3 percent Odds to Win. Kuchar has played in five of six tournaments here and has never finished worst than 25th.
Kuchar  ->  positive

That is the obvious risk you take whenever Scott finds his way onto your roster. However, if his ball striking is back to a place where we expect Scott to be, the putter will show up on occasion and you have to take your shots with him. Scott has three made cuts at Arnie’s tournament, including a 3rd place finish in 2014.
Scott  ->  positive

Others to consider: Brooks Koepka  Mid Tier $9,500-7,500  Matt Kuchar ($9,200): The Kuch is back in the states, riding the patriotic wave from his Bronze medal performance in Rio. Kuchar is a tailor-made cash play here as usual. Solid form, solid event history, and solid stats for the course, what’s not to love about the Kuch?
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Other Options: Jon Rahm    Mid-Tier Plays    Adam Scott (DK: $8,600, FD: $8,400)    Adam Scott is a tee-to-green master and has been scoring consistent but not spectacular results all season. The worry with Scott is how awful his putter is, but with reports being that these greens are lightning fast, we may see the entire field struggle making putts. He also has a nice narrative since he is expecting a child shortly after the event, so this should be his final tournament of the season.
Scott  ->  positive

He knows the course from his Georgia Tech days like the back of his hand. Fade: Patrick Reed. He’s finished 19th and 27th the past two seasons, and didn’t break par a year ago.
Patrick Reed.  ->  negative

Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn't exactly fit the "bomber" prototype that tends to succeed here, but he didn't play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition's averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance with his driver -- he sits near the top in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes. Moore is a very steady player on the par-4s, but he'll need to improve on the par-5s to really have a chance to finish near the top this week.
Moore  ->  positive

He struggled at first despite dropping a hint with T25 in 2011 but in the last two years he's broken par in all eight rounds, finishing T11 in 2016 and T8 last year when dropping out of the payout places with a bogey at 18 although he still signed for an excellent 66 on Sunday. Laird twice eagled the easy par-5 opener that week and says of Riviera: "I just love this golf course." Hence it's one of the first tournaments pencilled in on his schedule.
Laird  ->  positive

Having Jordan Spieth sitting $1,300 more than any other golfer(on DraftKings) is going to, in my opinion, push a lot of people down to start a more balanced lineup. If you know me or have read my articles in the past, you have probably noticed that I always favor Spieth, especially this time of year. For a feel of where ownership is going to be this week, be sure to head over to FanSharSports where they track all the social media mentions of all players throughout the week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Returning to the power angle, I think it may be worth forgiving JB Holmes a couple of missed cuts since he played in the final group at Torrey Pines. Firstly, the disappointment of missing out on the play-off there will have stung and if we go back to his last win, it's interesting to note that Holmes had come up just short three weeks before, then went on to miss the cut at Bay Hill before a hard-fought victory in Houston. Secondly, he was forced to go on the defensive - and rightly so - having taken over four minutes to play his second shot at the final hole of that event, and it's possible that the media spotlight which he felt was undeserved had a detrimental impact on his performance in Phoenix just days later.
Holmes  ->  positive

Rec Adj Birdies: 17.3, Patrick Reed ($9,000)  DJ leads all players in this metric, but Reed in next in line among players in this range of salaries. Reed started the playoffs in fashion, with a victory at The Barclays and a fifth-place finish at the Deutsche Bank Championship. He finished 13th at the BMW Championship two weeks ago despite hitting only 56 percent of his greens and 42 percent of his fairways in regulation.
Reed  ->  positive

Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory.
Casey  ->  positive

The $10 Million prize. Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now.
Spieth  ->  positive

In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats. Paul Casey ($9,000): I have been using Casey in every tournament this year so why stop now.
Molinari  ->  positive

Yet the former amateur star has made the cut in every start, highlighted by two top-three finishes. With a relatively weak field, this could be Cantlay's platform to shine. The gamble in this group is Hadwin, who took the tour by storm in the early parts of 2017 with a win, four top-10s and a 59, yet has been a non-entity as of late (missing three of his past five cuts).
Cantlay's  ->  positive

Steele placed sixth at the Tournament of Champions two weeks ago has solid history at the CareerBuilder, finishing 34th in 2016 and runner-up in 2015. With the way the pricing works this week, you can fit Steele and Johnson in the same lineup and still build a nice team. That should be a great approach as this is a good "studs and duds" week.
Johnson  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

Even after a few early wobbles, he showed unbelievable grit, class and mental toughness to get the job done in Royal Birkdale after a couple of early bogeys. After finishing solo fourth in New Orleans which included a 64 in the final round, Spieth went on to finish T2 at the Dean and Deluca Invitational after an impressive final round 65. He then travelled to Ohio for the Memorial tournament and finished a respectable T13 for the week.
Spieth  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen is among the second wave of the market having shared second last week, but at twice the price I'm keen to chance his compatriot Charl Schwartzel. The obvious negative is that Schwartzel missed the cut at the PLAYERS, but he's never played well at Sawgrass, a course which perhaps demands more patience than he possesses, and it's just not any kind of factor as far as I'm concerned. Prior to that, he was of course third in the Masters, a much better measure of his overall game, and having dusted off the cobwebs in Florida I'm hopeful that he could get in the mix from an early stage here.
Schwartzel.  ->  positive

Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week. This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day.
Spieth  ->  positive

Ranked 3rd in P5S & BoB%, and has really good course history with 5/6 trips here no worse than a 13th place finish. $3 GPP Ownership Guess: 15-20%  Jordan Spieth - DK Salary $11,600 - It's so close for Spieth right now, and I'm overly confident he will win one of the remaining three events this season. His strokes gained approach numbers looked much better last week, and that part of his game had been holding him back.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late. And let's not forget one Tiger Woods who's been a revelation on his return to the PGA Tour.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Since his near miss at Torrey Pines Noren has had two more steady weeks on the PGA tour with top 25 finishes at both Phoenix and Riviera and I am confident he will go well again this week. TOMMY FLEETWOOD – 33-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 4th  By now it should have become apparent the direction in which my preview is heading this week and next on my list of quality international ball strikers is Tommy Fleetwood. It’s funny to think that, all bar one week, this time last year I was backing Tommy at 200-1 in the WGC Mexico.
Tommy Fleetwood.  ->  positive

Grillo is typically a bottom-100 player on the greens, but this season he is near the top. That's a sign of either improved play -- after all, Grillo is only 25 years old -- or early-season variance, but his price tag makes it worth the risk to find out. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Kiradech Aphibarnrat  Newer daily fantasy PGA players might not be terribly familiar with the "Barn Rat," but he has been very good of late, picking up a win at the Super Six last month and an impressive fifth-place finish at the WGC Mexico two weeks ago.
Grillo  ->  positive

Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential. He’s a lock.
Rahm  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($9,700) is coming off of his best U.S. Open finish since 2007 and has played well all season. Casey is 12-of-13 with making the cut this year, including seven top-25 finishes. His play so far this year is good enough to land him within the top-60 in every major statistical category.
Casey  ->  positive

Our pundit bids to continue his fine form as the PGA Tour playoffs move on to Boston... The winner: Rickie Fowler  If there is a player with the temperament to quickly recover from blowing a big PGA Tour win then it is Rickie Fowler. It looked like he was going to trade blows down the stretch with Patrick Reed until a huge wobble – bogey at 15, double at 16 and bogey at 18 – dropped him into a tie for 7th  Maybe I am a glass half full kind of guy but I saw lots to be positive about in Fowler’s play ahead of his defence of the Deutsche Bank at TPC Boston this week.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

He’s missed one cut here in five tries since his win in ’08, and has had a pretty stellar year to date with three top-10s (two T4, one T8) and having made five straight cuts. Reavie is consistently deadly accurate off the tee, an above average putter, and he crushes the world with a short iron in his hands (4 from 125-150, 30 from 100-125). He’s more known as a par-4 scorer, but Reavie is also demolishing par-3s this year (2.98 scoring average, 6 ) and with four tough par-3s that will be crucial.
Reavie  ->  positive

Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
Daniel Berger,  ->  positive

There was certainly no disgrace in losing that last-16 clash and Oosthuizen's game appeared to be in good shape, especially considering how often he does manage to find another gear in the events that matter most. Indeed, I strongly suspect that the 2010 Open champion is only really engaged when he turns up in majors these days and that's backed up by his now famous grand slam of runner-up finishes, including second to Thomas at last year's PGA Championship. Here at Augusta, he lost a 2012 play-off to Bubba Watson and after struggling to put that behind him a year later, has since built up a solid bank of form with three top-25 finishes in four and no further missed cuts.
Thomas  ->  positive

For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas. 2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

His big hitting off the tee will always give him a chance, but he is hitting a good percentage of greens (73.93%) this season and that will go a long way this week. Kyle Stanley 125/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  Kyle Stanley is a player that has been off the radar for a while now, but this week I think he has a chance to put himself firmly back in the spotlight. Five years on from his win here, Stanley has not yet managed to find another win.
Stanley  ->  positive

He gained 1.37 and 3.22 strokes respectively on the field in those two tournaments so there are only positives to be taken. Reed plays this year's FedEx Cup opener on the back of his best ever performance in a major - tied second in the PGA Championship - so his already unwavering confidence levels will be even higher. The good thing with the American is that he's not settling for what he's got.
Reed  ->  positive

Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign. A win at the CIMB and a 5th at the CJ Cup in his last two starts suggests Perez is ready for another strong season and after four events currently sits in 2nd place in the FedEx Cup standings.
Perez  ->  positive

The winner typically finishes in the mid to upper teens under par in ideal conditions. Back in 2015 Alex Cejka finished -7 when the wind was howling as compared to Chesson Hadley coming in at -21 back in 2014. Since the tournament usually features plenty of scoring, we are going to target players with a strong Birdie or Better %.
Alex  ->  positive

Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016. Seeing fellow 40-somethings Phil Mickelson and then Paul Casey end their own victory droughts can't have hurt, Johnson's stretching back to the 2015 Open Championship, and I can't fathom why he's priced up along with Kevin Na, Emiliano Grillo and Lovemark. Surely, he's entitled to be closer to the front of the market and he's a strong each-way fancy.
Johnson  ->  positive

He is probably too risky for cash games but is an excellent, high upside GPP play. Who the Stat Like  Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#74)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,100)  I already talked about Hadwin and Steel who rank #1 and #3 in my overall model so we will jump right to the guy in the middle of them, Tony Finau. Looking at the field ranks for this week, Finau is 1st in SG: OTT, 2nd in SG: OTT + APP, 5th in Driving Distance, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd and 14th in GIR from 175-200 and 200+ and 15th in both Bogey Avoidance and Birdie or Better %.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Johnson finished 15th here last season, which isn’t good when there’s only 18 golfers, but he has ripped off three wins and an additional six top-10 finishes in 12 tournaments since the start of June. Jordan Spieth ($10,300): Spieth won the Australian Open two weeks ago and has the second-best Odds to Win (14.3 percent) this week. Spieth dunked it on the Par-3 second hole here last year, earning the all-important DraftKings hole-in-one bonus on his way to a fourth-place finish.
Spieth  ->  positive

He’s a great value this week. Wesley Bryan ($7,500) – Bryan’s exceptional performances recently at both Riviera and PGA National warrant some reasonable attention this week as he will be on a course where his particular skill set should very much come in handy regardless of his lack of length. If his tee-to-green game is on point, Bryan is dangerous around and on the greens, and he could be an excellent value pick this week.
Wesley Bryan  ->  positive

He almost escaped his group, but was bested by eventual winner Bubba Watson. Then, Suri hit the road the next day and played his way into the Houston Open, where he finished T8. Already twice a winner across the pond (on both the Euro and Challenger Tours), Suri is a highly volatile player, but one with gigantic upside.
Suri  ->  positive

MY PICK : Henrik Stenson ($9,400)  It’s hard to pick one player to stand out from what is basically an all star field of golfers this week. Still, I do see this as an opportunity for Henrik Stenson to end his already amazing 2016 with a bang. Stenson won the Open Championship in maybe the most brilliant display of golf in a major ever, nearly won the Olympic gold and was just his usual cool self all year.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Key stats follow in importance. • Driving accuracy  • Greens in regulation/strokes gained approach  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Bogey avoidance      Past Champions    2017 – Rickie Fowler  2016 - Adam Scott  2015 – Padraig Harrington  2014 – Russell Henley  2013 – Michael Thompson  2012 – Rory McIlroy  2011 – Rory Sabbatini  2010 – Camilo Villegas  2009 – Y.E. Yang  2008 – Ernie Els    Champion's Profile    Looking at last year's leaderboard, most guys in the top-10 had at least one double-bogey or even a triple-bogey.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

9 in the OWGR, being in a happier place. Tier 2 Values    Justin Rose - $8,400 (20-1)    Rose has the tools to play well at Riviera, where he tied for 16th last year and posted two other top-15s through the years. Rose stumbled on Sunday at Pebble to tumble down the leaderboard, but he had a pair of top-4s in his two prior outings.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Valero Texas Open Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Brendan Steele & Branden Grace – On the heels of an impressive Sunday at The Heritage, Grace seems to have finally righted his game. As will be the theme with many of the picks this week, the South African dominates off the tee and with his irons, but is lost on the greens.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Martin is swinging the hot stick right now and could be just what you need to round out your roster this week. In his last two events (Sony Open, RSM Classic), he’s finished T 7 and T 22 with 20 total birdies in each event. Martin has shot in the 60s for seven straight competitive rounds; nothing to sneeze at regardless of the course difficulty.
Martin  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Rickie Fowler ($9,200) – I’m not entirely sure how DK arrived at the conclusion that this price made any sense for Fowler, but here we have it. Like Spieth, Fowler is resilient and grindy with exceptional patience. He has had significant success at British Opens in the past, and I believe his superb T2G game and should put him squarely in the conversation to ship this event, particularly if the conditions get nasty.
Fowler  ->  positive

Further, Wagner is fresh off a T5 finish at another Par 70 TPC course last week, where he posted 78.0 DraftKings points. Wagner has posted 64.25 PPT and a +20.18 Plus/Minus in his last two trips to the Old White. Outside of DFS, he currently has +8,000 moneyline odds in the prop market to win the tournament.
Wagner  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup. Bradley did win the WGC-Bridgestone event in 2012, but despite a bunch of top-5 and top-10 finishes since, he has failed to record another PGA Tour victory. Before that last win, he had the chance to kick off 2012 in style, but Bill Haas ruined that here, beating both Bradley and his 2012 Ryder Cup partner, Phil Mickelson.
Bradley  ->  positive

The Masters Tournament, April 6th to 9th 2017  Introduction:  Best Prices - Top Debutant Market: Jon Rahm @ 11/4 (Bet Victor) Tyrrell Hatton @ 5/1 Thomas Pieters @ 8/1 (Betfred) Adam Hadwin @ 8/1 (Bet365) Tommy Fleetwood @ 9/1 (Betfred) Alex Norén @ 11/1 Hudson Swafford @ 20/1 (Betfred) William McGirt @ 25/1 Jeunghun Wang @ 25/1 Curtis Luck @ 45/1 (Betfred) Si-Woo Kim @ 50/1 Daniel Summerhays @ 50/1 (Stan James) Mackenzie Hughes @ 50/1 (Bet Victor) Billy Hurley III @ 66/1 (Stan James) Brian Stuard @ 66/1 (Stan James) Scott Gregory @ 150/1 (Stan James) Brad Dalke @ 150/1 (Stan James) Stewart Hagestad @ 125/1 Toto Gana @ 150/1    Top Pick:  My Selections:  The world's top golfers descend upon Augusta National this week for the 81st Masters Tournament. Following the Shell Houston Open in Texas, Russell Henley booked the final spot in this year's opening major championship and nineteen rookies will drive down Magnolia Lane for the first time. It has been an exciting opening six months to the PGA Tour season with four first time winners securing invitations to The Masters.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

We head overseas for a smaller field event in the CIMB Classic. This event has been dominated by two men in recent years, Justin Thomas and Ryan Moore. With the shortened field, cash is not recommended, but it is certainly still an option, especially if there’s overlay.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Rose’s driving accuracy may be down in 2017, but his combination of precision and power should play well on a long track in Texas. Also like: Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. Both of these guys are in great form and play well at this course.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

9. Emiliano Grillo, Argentina -- The 23-year-old probably wrapped up the 2016 Rookie of the Year Award on the PGA Tour last week when he tied for second behind Patrick Reed in his FedEx Cup playoffs debut at The Barclays. Grillo, who won the season-opening Frys.com Open in a playoff over Kevin Na in October, has added nine finishes in the top 25 this season and ranks sixth in the point standings heading into the Deutsche Bank Championship.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

This will be his fourth start at his national Open, so he has some experience to draw on. Statistically, Kisner has been solid this season, which has allowed him to accumulate five top-10’s including his win. He ranks 37th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee which is vital this week, but more impressive is how he ranks in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green (9th), Stroked Gained: Tee-to-Green (9th) and Stroked Gained: Putting (23rd).
Kisner  ->  positive

One week after last year's Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III contended for three days at the Greenbrier, don't be surprised to see the current Presidents Cup captain get into the mix on a course where he's won before. -- Jason Sobel  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner has "only" won the John Deere Classic once, but since 2010 his average finish is between seventh and eighth place. The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois.
Johnson  ->  positive

I'm going to keep my pick along those lines, taking another former major champion and Ryder Cup player whose game had suffered a bit of a tailspin but is now enjoying a bit of an uptick. Bradley owns top-10 finishes in each of his past two starts and should have plenty of confidence at a tournament where he finished T-8 last year. Michael Collins -- Jason Bohn ($7,600)  In the three years the tournament has been held at this venue, Bohn had finishes of T-2, T-7 and T-3.
Bradley  ->  positive

Quicken Loans National Picks (Yahoo Game)  Brendan Steele & Bill Haas – After churning out another T15 at the Travelers, Steele has now reeled off 21 consecutive cuts made dating back to July of 2016 and has the ideal consistency for a player taking on an unknown course. One of the premiere Par 4 scorers in the field, Steele also sits 14th on the season in scrambling… Haas doesn’t exactly hit every fairway anymore, but he’s continued to churn out quality results based around his consistency and top tier short game. Ranking, 15th in SG: ATG for the year, he’s reeled off three straight T25 finishes (including a T5 at the US Open) and has a knack for posting wins on shorter tracks with weak fields.
Haas  ->  positive

15th for Greens in Regulation last week at Bay Hill, Harris has always taken a liking to coastal challenges. The 2014 OHL Classic winner at El Camaleon on Paspalum greens, English has putted positively across his past 3 appearances. 2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014.
Harris  ->  positive

John Peterson 200/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  I put Peterson up for the other event in his home state, the Shell Houston Open, just for him to withdraw before the off, but I like chances that bit more here, at the same price. Last week, Peterson turned up to the RBC Heritage off the back of some travelling issues and a weekend in Vegas, but this time the father-to-be looks to be in better focus. In a reply to a tweet effectively asking him if there will be any pre-tournament distractions this week, he stated “Nah.
John Peterson  ->  positive

A fantastic long game has always been the Japanese sensation's biggest asset - 302 yards off the tee and Total Driving ranks of 21st in 2016 and 13th for the season-to-date doesn't tell a lie - however when Hideki is most dangerous is when the flat stick is cooperating too and he's in the middle of a purple patch in that respect right now which should spell danger to the rest of the field. 3rd for putting average at Erin Hills (1.63 putts per GIR), 15th at Portstewart (1.68) and 2nd at Birkdale (1.67) is the best prolonged spell we've seen from Matsuyama since he won an incredible 5 events in 9 global starts either side of Christmas. With confidence clearly growing once again with the putter it will only take a decent ball-striking week on a course which suits like Firestone for him to be knocking on the door once again.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

He’s 12th on Tour in birdie or better percentage, 15th in rough proximity and ninth in proximity from 175-200 yards. Luke List - $14,200    List has rattled off five straight finishes of T26 or better as he currently resides in the top-70 of the OWGR for the first time in his career. Not only is he third on Tour in driving distance, but he’s also 23rd in birdie average and 17th in SG: T2G.
List  ->  positive

His only knock on the cheatsheet is the Strokes Gained: Approach but looking at his last five events, he has gained over two strokes to the field in the category and that is skewed big time by his U.S. Open performance where he lost almost two strokes to the field. Like I mentioned above, I don't think you need to go into this range for cash games but I think Reed is trending in the right direction and has the upside to win us a GPP this week. Who the Stats Like  Brendan Steele  World Golf Ranking (#52)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,800)    I could have easily fit Steele into the form tier as he has been one of, if not the most consistent golfer on the Tour.
Reed  ->  positive

Justin Rose - $16,600    The 2016 Masters runner-up has been a world-class ball striker for years, but a below-average putter has limited Rose to just one career major victory. With rain in the forecast throughout the week, Erin Hills’ greens are projected to soften up a bit, lessening the margin between Rose and those who usually maintain a putting advantage. He’s top 10 on Tour in SG: off-the-tee and fifth in par-four scoring, and is priced a whole $1,300 cheaper than Jason Day.
Rose  ->  positive

If he can avoid the bunkers this week, a top-20 from the Canadian is in the picture. Streelman missed the cut three years in a row from 2012-2014 at the Memorial, but he has since finished T18-T8. He’s top-50 on Tour in driving accuracy, and recently ranked fourth among the field in terms of SG: approach-the-green at the DEAN & DELUCA Invitational, where he finished T18.
Streelman  ->  positive

First @SonyOpenHawaii bet is Si Woo Kim at 66/1. Kim finished fourth on sole course start in 2016 and could benefit… https://t.co/2vHlNe7IgC
Kim  ->  positive

He's tied with DeLaet for the second-best win odds in the tournament, as well. Wesley Bryan ($8,900) - Bryan opened at 18/1 along with DeLaet and McDowell but is up to 16/1 now, making him the odds-on favorite to win, so I'm not really going out on a limb here. Still, Bryan sits 73rd in the Official World Golf Rankings, making him the highest-ranked golfer in the field.
DeLaet  ->  positive

So in a world where there are question marks about the 2 single-digit market leaders, the relaxed theme of the Sony Open could well play into Marc's hands in his quest to post 4 strong rounds this week. 8th for Greens in Regulation, 2nd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green, 6th for Proximity to Hole and 8th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green show an approach game which is in rude health and Leishman is a proven Bermudagrass green winner who shot -23/261 to win the BMW Championship last August.

The last couple of events he saw Perez’s price tag creep a little high for my liking, even though he was still playing well and the course fit his game. Now we can roster Perez without the expectation of a T15 and be pleasantly surprised when it happens. Perez is flying under the radar this week after multiple weeks being hyped up.

Steve Rawlings takes a look at the local challengers at this week's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale...  “This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.“  Three of the first four in the Top GB & Ireland market are English - Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Paul Casey - but it's now 25 years since an Englishman won the Open Championship so we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Rose, Casey, Fleetwood and their fellow compatriots, even if one of them, Fleetwood, is playing very close to home. Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose.
Tommy Fleetwood  ->  positive

Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years. Ian’s locked in right now and the last laugh will be his come Sunday evening when his name gets carved on the Claret Jug.
Poulter  ->  positive

Looking to back outsiders in this week's golf tournaments? Paul Krishnamurty has scoured the list of players available at 99-1 or more, recommending three picks and some alternatives...  "Poulter is always worth considering when in Florida, where he has a home. His record on Bermuda greens is excellent and he's contended strongly for most of the Florida Swing events.
"Poulter  ->  positive

Deserves to be included in top plays for the week as well. Paul Casey ($8,600): Casey is grouped with a bundle of very good quality players this week but he still sticks out to me as the best option. He started 2017 fairly slowly but I really like the fact he was in contention at the Farmers a few weeks ago, a course he’d never challenged at previously.
Casey  ->  positive

Fowler and DJ two back. Sens: Rose five under, Spieth four under, Rahm even. Passov: I've been picking Spieth since 2015, primarily because it was defensible: He's pretty good at this game, and he came close at the 2011 U.S.
Spieth  ->  positive

With only 15 tags on FanShareSports, he has the third fewest out of anyone priced above $9K. Hoffman’s recent form is incredible, with an 8th place finish at the U.S. Open followed by a T3 at the Travelers. Maybe it only took a couple weeks off to forget what Charley has been up to?
Hoffman’s  ->  positive

4. Paul Casey -- Casey has been in position to win each of the last two playoff events, and that's probably a safe bet to continue here at East Lake. 5.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Like DJ, his record on Bentgrass greens is very good and he arrives at Eagle Point in fair form given he was beaten in a playoff in Phoenix in February and that he was tied 11th at the Heritage last time out. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [6.4]  Webb Simpson @ [44.0]  Carl Pettersson @ [260.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow morning with my Golf Sixes preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Carl Pettersson  ->  positive

Like Gomez though, Brown shares an affinity with Coco Beach G&CC in Puerto Rico and the Georgian also has lots of linkable form across PGA National (10th 2016), Copperhead (7th 2016), Harbour Town (5th 2014), Sedgefield (3rd 2015), Annandale (5th 2012), El Camaleon (5th 2015) and Sea Island (4th (2013). He clearly loves Bermudagrass greens, warmer climes and with best mate on Tour Kevin Kisner winning 2 weeks ago at Colonial, Brown is likely to take inspiration from that this week. Watch these tips on YouTube with Steve Bamford: Golf Betting System YouTube Channel
Brown  ->  positive

He is also a TCU grad so he has a nice local narrative playing in his favor this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Bud Cauley  Cauley returns to competition this week and has been showing some really good form as of late. If you include the team effort at the Zurich Classic, he has finished in the top-10 in three straight events.
Cauley  ->  positive

Henley’s third tour victory came last year at the Houston Open when, with the final place in the Augusta field on the line, he shot 65 on Sunday to overturn a four stroke deficit to cruise to victory. Henley’s form this year has been a little patchy however he seemed to click at just the right time when he closed with a 65 yesterday in Houston to finish in 8th place. So we’ve established Henley is running in to form at the right time however what makes him really jump of the page this week is his progressive form figures at Augusta.
Henley’s  ->  positive

Form wise Casey is playing sold golf at the moment and could follow up his top 10 last week in Pebble with another good week here. Phil Mickelson 25/1  Phil seems to be warming up nicely lately with back to back to 5’s in his last two starts. He has been in good shape since the start of the season posting a T3 at the Safeway Open back in October and followed that with a T15 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China, which included a final round 67.
Phil  ->  positive

Top-level scrambling to avoid damaging bogeys is essential and only those with the hottest putters ultimately triumph. So I'm turning to Jon Rahm this week for a number of key reasons. Naturally on his last outing in late November, Jon won his biggest title to date when securing the DP World Tour Championship.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total. Roster the veteran in this weak field event.
Mickelson  ->  positive

There’s a plethora of players vying for a place in the six-man line-up for the official European Tour fantasy game and the addition of some top Americans, who are now eligible, adds to the difficulty for gamers. Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood will surely be a staple of most line-ups given their exploits here last year while Dutchman Joost Luiten could be a big-value outsider to cause a few waves. One To Swerve  Tyrrell Hatton’s T10 last year may have been based on the fact he was in fantastic form rather than loved the course.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

So, we're left with just two players. Justin Rose and Kevin Kisner. Four of the last six US Open winners had made the top 10 at Memorial a few weeks earlier so that event really does seem an ideal prep.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Beau rewarded this exemption by finishing 39th. There is no doubt that Hossler has the pedigree to succeed on the PGA tour and he is certainly a player who will be fully focused on the job in hand this week. He is sure to have plenty of local support and again like Cauley he is a very strong putter, which will be rewarded here.
Hossler  ->  positive

2016 RSM Classic top 10 picks  1. Chris Kirk - He won on Sea Island in 2013, and he's been brilliant through this six-event run of the season. 2.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out.
Gay  ->  positive

Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place. At some point I expect Wes Bryan to bounce back, and why not this week on a course that plays to Bryan’s strengths? Wes Bryan has the game to win an event like this and is going to be my super sleeper to win here  Click To Enlarge!
Bryan  ->  positive

As an indication of how little change there is, look at the state of affairs last year after rounds one and three... Round One  Andrew Landry -4  Dustin Johnson -3  Lee Westwood -3  Shane Lowry -2  Sergio Garcia -2  Scott Piercy -2    Round Three  Shane Lowry -7  Andrew Landry -3  Dustin Johnson -3  Lee Westwood -2  Daniel Summerhays -2  Branden Grace -1  Sergio Garcia level par  Scott Piercy level par    Since as far back as 1898, no winner has been further back at halfway than Simpson, who sat tied for 29th and still six off the lead. He's the only winner in the last 11 years to be outside the top-three places after 36 holes and he's the only winner to be outside the top-12 at halfway since Larry Nelson back in 1983.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

This is quite a specialised event so strong results on Florida-type courses are essential. My selections are as follows:  Tiger Woods 4pts Win 7/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim here:  Tiger Woods with Florida form of 12/2 just has to be backed for his first PGA Tour win since 2013 here at Bay Hill where he's won the title across 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013.
Tiger Woods  ->  positive

Now add in the fact that he’s finished second-first-second his last three PGA Tour starts, he’s a no brainer worth every penny of admission. Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months.
Spieth,  ->  positive

#WyndhamChampionship Long Shot Bets = Si Woo Kim 150/1, Reavie 175/1, Weekley 215/1, Huh 350/1
Huh  ->  positive

Those two second places at East Lake add to a pair of runners-up finishes at nearby Augusta National so playing Rose 'without Spieth' makes extra sense given that he's been the nearly man so many times in Georgia. It's stating the obvious to say that Spieth would out-putt him if the two were locked together coming down the stretch so I'm convinced this is the best market for Rose this week. Of the other short-priced candidates, Jason Day has really found something in the last few weeks so would be my next cab off the rank in the sub-20/1 shots.
Rose  ->  positive

I want the Texan as my anchor. Jon Rahm ($11,000): Entered 2017 ranked 137th in the OWGR. He's now 4th in the world rankings.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

A win looks imminent and the 40/1 looks well worth a play. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 22/1  There's no shortage of players who could be considered as legitimate bets this week.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Grillo did also get to -16 at one stage, which was one better than the two that contested the play-off, but a back-9 41 led to a final round 74, which ultimately cost him. In the end Grillo finished T11 last season, which was a stellar attempt on debut and now with a year of experience under his belt alongside some good current form, he looks a good bet to go better this time around. Kyle Stanley 100/1 (Betfred & StanJames 6 places ¼ odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Statistically, Kyle Stanley is a dream fit for me this week so to leave him out at 100/1 would make no sense.
Grillo  ->  positive

Charl Schwartzel at 66/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - gone well here before; can easily ignore last week  0.5pt e.w. Robby Shelton at 250/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - top-class talent in the making  Considering that host venue TPC Four Seasons is not perhaps among the more popular layouts on the circuit, another strong field has been secured for the AT&T Byron Nelson. That's in part a reflection of the sponsors, in part the fact that so many touring professionals have a connection to Texas, and in part the the schedule, which kept many of the game's biggest and best away from the spotlight between the Masters and last week's PLAYERS Championship and now in need of exercise.
Robby Shelton  ->  positive

Among these golfers, those who have high Adj Rd Scores and low salaries make great value plays. Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm?
Cantlay  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Henrik Stenson 2pts EW 12/1  Justin Rose 1pt EW 25/1  Brandt Snedeker 1pt EW 40/1  Branden Grace 1pt EW 45/1  Russell Knox 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 11 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter @Doublebogey63  Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Knox has performed well on tough courses this season and if he putts well he could have a decent chance here. He looks to have the game that could suit this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, second in GIR, 35th in scrambling and 19th in par 4 scoring.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

If he brings his “Olympics” game to Bathpage he could be a big danger here. Brandt Snedeker 40/1  After shooting an impressive final round 67 to finish T3 at The Wyndham last week, that makes it his second top five in his last three starts for Snedeker. He has been showing some decent form lately finishing in a respectable T17 at The Dean and Deluca Invitational and followed that with a T21 at The Bridgestone, T22 at The Open Championship and a T5 at The RBC Canadian Open.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

He’s had some close calls this season. Holmes was third at Royal Troon and fourth at Muirfield Village in the Memorial, the event hosted by Jack Nicklaus in June. Holmes has the distance to shorten this course and distance can help hide other errors on this long track.
Holmes  ->  positive

However, we still have a relatively strong field this week. The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Graham DeLaet - $15,300    The Canadian continues to be held back by his brutal wedge play around the greens, but he otherwise excels tee-to-green and has finished T26-T10 in his past two starts. DeLaet ranks 15th on Tour in proximity from over 200 yards and 20th in GIR percentage. Mid-Tier Glue Guys    Kevin Streelman - $14,900    Streelman, coming off a final-round 64 at the Travelers Championship, has placed top-20 at three straight events.
DeLaet  ->  positive

So it's hard not to like Rickie this week on a coastal course where wind will undoubtedly be a large factor. 2 visits have generated a 6th (2013) and 5th (2016) and it's true that Fowler has never arrived on Maui with such total confidence in his putter. Whilst Spieth, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have question marks against them in my mind with recent performances, Fowler seems at the peak of his powers and his record after winning is also an interesting angle.
Fowler  ->  positive

McIlroy is tied with Johnson atop the field with his 67.6 LT Adj Rd Score, and his massive, field-best 17.5 LT Adj Bird Avg makes him an elite play in DraftKings’ birdie-heavy scoring system every week. On FanDuel, McIlroy ranks behind only Johnson with 50.6 fantasy points per game in Rounds 3 and 4. We currently have McIlroy projected to be the chalk play of the week with 26-30 percent ownership in large-field tournaments.
Johnson  ->  positive

After this unfortunately things went horribly wrong for Martin and he failed to make another cut all season before losing his card and having to return to the Web.com tour last year. The good news was though that Piller bounced back well last year notching a win on the Web.com to regain his card. Since returning to the big league Martin has notched two more top 5 finishes including one at the Greg Norman designed course used for the OHL Mayakoba.
Martin  ->  positive

All three are great options, but it's not a bad week to choose anyone from the course history list, as history often repeats itself here at El Camaleón Golf Club. Personally, I want to back someone who is accurate off the tee this week, so I will pluck Russell Knox from the list above and use him as my One-and-Done pick this week. After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Selections    I've surprised myself and backed Adam Scott and I've taken a chance on four outsiders... I'm not convinced the venue's right for Smylie Kaufman but he's been catching the eye of late and he's one of few making his debut so I've had a small wager on him and I've also played Chris Kirk, D.A Points and John Huh. Kirk, who's a winner of the aforementioned RSM Classic, has played here only once before when he missed the cut in 2012 after a disastrous opening 78.
Chris Kirk,  ->  positive

Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts. Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix.
Taylor  ->  positive

Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9500 FD: $9200  He’s got to win eventually right? Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics. Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts.

PICKS  I have gone with five players this week as follows;  MARTIN PILLER – 200-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED MC  For my first and if you like my headline selection this week I am going to actually start with by far the biggest priced player in my team in the form of a Lone Star State guy Martin Piller. The reason to be Piller heads the list this week is basically his price. I really don’t get it and would say 100s is as big as he should be and certainly not 200s.
Martin Piller.  ->  positive

Boston though with its Bentgrass greens will be a blessed relief, especially as 5 of his 8 PGA Tour titles have been on pure Bentgrass putting surfaces. 10th last week on Long Island featured a very strong greens in regulation game (for the second tournament in a row), but Spieth's hallmark putting failed to fire with the poa annua. I'm not so sure that will be the case at the Deutsche.
Spieth's  ->  positive

That momentum didn’t quite carry over the 2017 calendar year and so far he has let a lot of people down on DraftKings. However, Casey fits this course perfectly, and has the Augusta narrative working in his favor. Casey came second here in 2015 and has back-to-back top 6 results at the Masters.
Casey  ->  positive

RESULT: T11  Xander Schauffele 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street. The 2017 Greenbrier Classic and Tour Championship champion, Schauffele has been inevitably quieter in 2018 but he's still playing some excellent golf.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

4. Jordan Spieth — Something is just a little off about Spieth’s game right now, but it’s still good enough to finish in the top 15 most weeks. 5.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Over on the Euro Tour, he’s missed two out of four cuts, but also picked up at T2 at the Hong Kong Open. Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play.
Suri  ->  positive

Tony Finau – $8,400  It’s a bombers week, so Tony Finau has to be considered especially at his reasonable $8,400 price tag. Finau has been playing solid this season with two top 5s in his last seven events. His stats line up perfectly for this course, ranking 2nd in strokes gained off the tee plus strokes gained approach.
Finau  ->  positive

Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Matt Kuchar  Kuchar has played the event 11 times and his average in relation to par over four rounds is -8.1. That might not seem great, but because of that average he ranks fourth on the tournament's all-time money list.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Of the two, I prefer McIlroy, who was a solid T20 on his first start here and has strong off-the-tee stats that fit the style of past winners. Other potential tournament targets include Alex Noren, Bubba Watson, Jason Kokrak, Sam Saunders and James Hahn. Top Strokes Gained: Tee to Green from Last Week  1.
Sam Saunders  ->  positive

Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar.
Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

I guess it is suitable for Finau as he has finished 10th and 12th in his only attempts at this course. Finau ranks 4th in GIR%, 6th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 17th in BoB%. I will only be using Finau in GPPs as he is volatile in nature and can finish T10 or miss cut.
Finau  ->  positive

Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.

Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green. Haas came T14 last year at the Heritage, so there is potential he can crack inside the top 15 again. He will be much lower owned then other $9K golfers, setting up the perfect GPP pivot.
Haas  ->  positive

East Lake is always a test where tee-to-green prowess prevails and with potentially soft conditions in play for a segment of the tournament, I will happily take Rose who's certainly on a roll. RESULT: T10  Webb Simpson 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 using code SPORTS60 , T&Cs apply (4 places, 1/4 odds):  I will finish the 2016/17 PGA Tour season with Webb Simpson. Always the sort who's a true "horse for the course", it's noticeable that the Tour Championship is often contended for by players ranked in the mid-teens when it comes to FEC standing.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

With all this mind, it is time to look at this event both from a betting and fantasy prospect. Betting selections  Jimmy Walker 50/1 (General)  Walker played terribly last week, no doubt about it, but the 2016 PGA Championship winner can make amends here. In seven efforts here, Walker has two top-10’s and a 12th, all of which came in his last four attempts.
Walker  ->  positive

£100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Matt Every 0.5pt EW FRL 200/1 with New! £50 welcome offer via this link:  Matt Every is showing definite signs of improvement of late and we know that he simply thrives on Bermudagrass greens. First signs of new growth came at TPC Southwind where he shot -6/64 to be first round leader, before finishing 27th.
Matt Every  ->  positive

Henley is on a roll after a win in Houston and T-11 at Augusta National. Perez looked good at Augusta and has a good track record at Harbour Town. Russell Henley and Pat Perez.
Perez  ->  positive

Glover looks to be good value here for a guy that’s bang in form. Cody Gribble 50/1  The Texan has been playing some fantastic golf so far this season with three top 15’s in his last four starts. He had a good week at The Safeway finishing T8 and didn’t shoot worse than a 70 throughout the week.
Cody Gribble  ->  positive

RESULT: T35  James Hahn 1pt EW 80/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I like the look of James Hahn this week who's been playing some great stuff on the West Coast and who has course form to boot. A player who can blow ice-cold, finding season-long statistics to back up any thoughts on him is nigh on impossible, but despite 3 relative poor outings in the autumn Hahn still ranks 49th for Birdie or Better Conversion, 29th for Strokes Gained Approach and 46th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green. What's really caught my eye though is Hahn's recent putting form which sees him sitting 9th in my rolling 10-week Putting Average tracker.
Hahn  ->  positive

And has some nice kind of rolling hills and some rolling greens that kind of dip off on the sides." Perez, by the way, has a couple of top sevens at Innisbrook. Bryan, a three-time winner on the Web.com last year (the first two coming in late March and April), is a short hitter (167th Driving Distance), who does his best work on and around the greens (35th Scrambling, 7th Putts Per Round) so this place should be a good fit.
Perez,  ->  positive

Palmer is 10th in SGT2G. Emiliano Grillo - $7,800    As with Kirk, this is not a pick we would've made two weeks ago, but Grillo is coming off a solo 11th at The Players. He's a solid 22nd in ball striking, 24th in SGT2G, 46th in P4P and T56 in proximity.
Kirk,  ->  positive

He's a risky play but at a triple-figure price he's well worth the risk and last but not least, I've thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned John Deere Classic winner, Bryson DeChambeau. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [25.0]  Jason Dufner @ [85.0]  Ollie Schniederjans @ [95.0]  Zach Johnson @ [110.0]  Bryson DeChambeau @ [130.0]  I'll be back later with the Hero Indian Open preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

RESULT: T29  Chris Kirk 1pt EW 60/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Chris Kirk is another who fits the bill very well this week. A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Put those two things together, and he ended up in fifth place. Branden Steele  Need some more tee-to-green to fill out your card? Then give Steele the nod.
Steele  ->  positive

Among these golfers, those who have high Adj Rd Scores and low salaries make great value plays. Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm?
Cantlay  ->  positive

He’s ranked 18th or better on Tour in both GIR percentage and SG: Putting, which is a formula that works just about anywhere. Francesco Molinari - $13,800    Since 2010, Molinari is second to only Henrik Stenson in terms of overall scoring in relation to par at Bay Hill. The Italian is 35-under-par in his last 20 rounds at the API, including three top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the event.
Molinari  ->  positive

I prefer Haas over Webb this week due to a few stats. He is better off the tee, a slightly better scrambler and looking at that GIR from 150-175 stat, Haas is ranked 5th while Webb is ranked 87th. With both golfers projected to be in the Top 5 of ownership, I won't have a whole lot of exposure this week as a GPP player.
Haas  ->  positive

Fitzpatrick currently ranks T4 in Strokes-Gained: Putting, slightly ahead of Donald in 8th. I mention Donald because he graduated from Northwestern University, where Fitzpatrick enrolled for just one semester, and many have drawn comparisons between the two since the start of Fitzpatrick’s career. Donald has forged a mighty fine career for himself, reaching World No.1 in 2011 and winning 16 times as a professional.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Players with comparable salaries and LT metrics have previously produced an average of 76.89 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +0.76 Plus/Minus and 54.3 percent Consistency Rating. Spieth has three top-25 finishes (including a fourth-place finish) and a missed cut in his past four trips to Riviera. Rory McIlroy ($11,100) missed the cut at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am after looking like his old dominant self in two European Tour starts in January.
Spieth  ->  positive

Doubling down on Fowler - 16/1 to win in Houston &amp; 28/1 to win The Masters. His game is without flaws right now.
Fowler  ->  positive

If you really are looking for some marginal ownership spots you can expect Henrik Stenson to be lower owned than he should be as a result of his rocky play recently and WD mid round a month or so ago. With 5/5 made cuts at this event, two runner ups, and a third place finish here I plan on exploiting Stenson’s downward trend in ownership. Click To Enlarge!
Stenson  ->  positive

I have absolutely no doubt at all that he will at least make the cut this year, and he’s got a pretty good shot of being quite relevant on the weekend. VALUE  Tony Finau ($7,900) – We’re now on bentgrass which automatically means that Tony Finau becomes about twice as good of a play as he was earlier in the season – and he was already a decent play on those tracks. He’s played exceptionally well over the last two years at Muirfield, and now we get him at a ridiculous bargain price on a course that suits him pretty much perfectly.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Lee was a very respectable 52nd on tour in Stroke Gained tee-to-green in 2016 and has very high upside at only $6,700. I look for Danny Lee to be widely ignored across all GPP formats while having a better projected range of outcomes than anyone in his price range. Good luck to all this week and I hope this has provided a different perspective on the game theory at play behind daily fantasy golf.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Naturally this Ryder Cup sub-plot will now continue through both the Deutsche and the BMW Championship with 3 Captain's Selections up for grabs after Crooked Stick in 2 weeks time. Fowler, Watson and Kuchar will be hard to shift, but a successful FedEx Playoff campaign, the likes of which we saw from Billy Horschel in 2014, could well change things. From a FedEx Cup perspective, Patrick Reed now leads from Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

He recorded a T8 there in his debut in 2012, and then validated with a T16 the following year. James Hahn  Hahn is perfect in 13 starts dating back to the 2017 FedExCup Playoffs. That is a reflection of his balance both in the short- and long-term.
Hahn  ->  positive

Justin won the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen in 2014. I could have easily plumped for Rose in the outright market but overcoming that defeat at Augusta won't be easy and there's always a constant worry about his ongoing back issues. As highlighted in the preview, I'm going to be concentrating on the leaders from very early on and if Rose, a notoriously slow starter, begins well, I'll be looking to get him onside but he looks a risky play before the off and he makes little appeal in this very competitive market.
Justin  ->  positive

DraftKings bargain: Bill Haas ($7,000). His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.)
Haas  ->  positive

With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week. Click To Enlarge!
Summerhays  ->  positive

He started the season with a T7 at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia which included a second round 63 and a final round 65. Casey then tee’d it up at the CJ Cup finishing T19 and followed that with a T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions, T8 in Pebble and a T12 at the WGC Mexico Championship where he shot three rounds of 68 or better. Casey then went to Copperhead where he shot a final round 69 to post 10 under in total, one clear of Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed.
Casey  ->  positive

However, in a weak field like this, you are forced to roster golfers in cash that you wouldn’t necessarily do in stronger fields. Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring.
Finau  ->  positive

Jon Rahm  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

Few in the field will be playing with as much confidence. Also like: Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship.
Rory  ->  positive

About half the field from the season-opening Tournament of Champions took a pass on the Sony a week ago, but Kevin Chappell, Jhonny Vegas, Brendan Steele, Grayson Murray and Adam Hadwin (site of his 59 last year) are all back on the links this time. The mid card is propped up by Sony holdovers Bill Haas, J.J. Spaun, Webb Simpson, Chez Reavie, Jason Dufner, Jimmy Walker, Charles Howell III, Peter Uihlein and Zach Johnson. However, we will have some star power with our first look at Patrick Reed, Phil Mickelson, Brandt Snedeker and Bubba Watson in 2018 — four of the biggest draws in the field.
Webb Simpson,  ->  positive

After putting up 10/1 winner Hideki Matsuyama in Phoenix last week, Dave Tindall brings us his analysis and tips for this week's PGA Tour event - the AT & T Pebble Beach Pro-Am...  Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      While some of the big names have struggled to get going this season, Justin Rose has started 2017 with a bang. Rather than play the Middle East Swing, the Olympic champion opened his campaign at the Sony Open in Hawaii and carded 66-64-66-64 to finish second, albeit a distant one, to the red-hot Justin Thomas. Rose was delighted though.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Fowler is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee ranking 32nd in driving distance, 36th in GIR, first in SG putting and fifth in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a good history on this course, Fowler looks another big contender here. Daniel Berger 60/1  I am sticking to my guns and backing Berger for the second week running here.
Fowler  ->  positive

Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000. Generally, I’d go a little further down the favorites list for this pick but I think Rahm has a legitimate chance to win this week.
Rahm  ->  positive

Key Stats:  Strokes Gained: Approach  Scrambling  Par 4 Scoring  Approach  AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Targets  Dustin Johnson $11,700  In my opinion, Johnson has easily the best wedge game in the world, and I will heavily target him anytime we get to a course that require short approach shots. DJ is a multi-time winner of this event and will play three rounds with his usual celeb partner and father in-law Wayne Gretzky.
Johnson  ->  positive

He was 10th after a slow start last year. Reed is 12/1 on the outrights and that's actually okay but removing Matsuyama, Spieth, Day and Johnson makes the task we ask of him so much simpler. He's 11/2 with the top four taken out and I'm confident this is a market he can win.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds. His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day.
Chappell  ->  positive

After missing the cut at The Masters a couple of weeks ago, we’re hoping Steele is lower owned than usual in GPPs. Steele is an elite ball striker on tour which will come in handy with windy conditions inevitable in Texas. He’s 1st in SG: OTT and 28th in SG: APP in the last 12 rounds.
Steele  ->  positive

8. Rickie Fowler: Fowler was a late addition to this week's field as he looks to make the Ryder Cup squad, with only one top-10 finish in his last eight PGA Tour starts. But a third-round 64 at the Olympics showed that the form he displayed en route to early-season success isn't lying very far beneath the surface.
Rickie Fowler:  ->  positive

He's a significantly better putter than the two ahead of him. When Kisner was second to Furyk here, he put on a ball-striking clinic and a similar display should see him go close once more, his focus no doubt fixed on atoning for Bay Hill and winning on what's home soil for the South Carolina man, who practices nearby at Kiawah Island. As for going win-only, again that's largely so he can share the load with Snedeker, but I'm a big believer in Kisner's ability to get it done.
Kisner  ->  positive

Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn’t exactly fit the “bomber” prototype that tends to succeed here: he’s 182nd in Driving Distance (286.6 yards), but he didn’t play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition’s averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance off the tee – he sits 16th in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes. Moore is a very steady player on the par-4s, but he’ll need to improve on the par-5s to really have a chance to finish near the top this week; he averages 4.01 on par-4s (21 measured rounds), but 4.62 on par-5s.
Moore  ->  positive

Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
Day  ->  positive

Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
Thomas.  ->  positive

Second favourite, Brooks Koepka, finished fourth here in 2014 but that solid effort is sandwiched by two missed cuts and he doesn't appear to be in scintillating form with figures reading 70-57-32-40 since he finished inside the top-ten at the Travelers Championship in August and he looks plenty short enough to me. The only other player trading at below [30.0] is the rapidly rising Spanish star, Jon Rahm, who's making his event debut this week. The 21-year-old burst on to the scene at the Waste Management Phoenix Open last February, when finishing tied for fifth as an amateur.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. Paul Casey is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Casey has two top-20 finishes at TPC River Highlands in the past two years, including a second-place finish in 2015 when he lost in a playoff.
Casey  ->  positive

-- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic. -- Joe Kaiser  DraftKings value picks  Kelly Kraft  I may be a week late on Kraft as he jumped up the leaderboard last week, but I'm thinking that the putting could still get better than it was last week (where he was putrid on the greens).
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

These are the type of events where he shines brightest. Charl Schwartzel $7,200 – Schwartzel is coming off a T12 at the Porsche European Open last week where he racked up 15 birdies and two eagles. He’s recorded two T10’s at Firestone Country Club in the last five years The South African ranks high in the field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach the Green and DraftKings Scoring.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

Hopefully he’s not too burned out from playing the weekend at Augusta. Webb Simpson  Webb has contended in this event (seven straight cuts made) for years, and that’s when he couldn’t putt. Still excellent with his irons, Simpson sits second in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting over his past 24 rounds.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong. But the clincher with Rose this week is how he has played on courses similar to Erin Hills. Rose was 4th at Whistling Straits, 12th at Pinehurst No.2 but the most interesting one is his Scottish Open win.
Rose  ->  positive

Although these numbers are more than likely unsustainable, it’s not out of the question that Spieth could improve upon his averages from his 2014-15 season, since he is still approaching his prime. In 70 tournaments since 2014, Spieth has produced a +3.67 Plus/Minus with 55.7 percent Consistency. His average ownership has been close to 25 percent in large-field DraftKings tournaments.
Spieth  ->  positive

He's registered two top 15s and a scoring average of 68.04. Robert Streb … The 30-year-old was in danger of losing his card until a runner-up finish at The Greenbrier Classic in early July. He added a T22 at the PGA Championship where his greenside touch was on display.
Robert Streb  ->  positive

He’s my pick to take down a stacked field. MY SLEEPER : Bill Haas ($6,900)  Haas has had an under-the-radar, solid season so far with 11 top-25 finishes already to his credit. While he hasn’t registered a win on the year, a T5 at the U.S. Open and top-five placings at both the WGC China event and the WGC Match Play are definitely worth noting.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Although surprisingly, given those stats, only eight third round leaders have successfully converted since 1996 so sitting second or third, a couple of strokes back, looks a great spot to be in through 54 holes. Market Leaders  Matt Kuchar was absolutely exhausted in Canada last week and there's a possibility that Jordan Spieth is still fatigued after the pair's epic duel at Royal Birkdale a fortnight ago but that a big if. The world no.2 took last week off and a well-rested and refreshed Jordan Spieth is most definitely the man to beat and I'm a little surprised he's not a shade shorter than he is.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

So, next for me is William McGirt, who gained his first PGA Tour title just over a year ago by beating a similar field and is capable of doubling up here. At 39th in greens hit, McGirt continues to strike the ball nicely and while he wasn't a factor last weekend, he showed up nicely enough for a couple of rounds on a golf course he admitted was just a little too long for him in the conditions. It may prove to be a positive that McGirt didn't contend at the US Open as he should arrive here relatively fresh and it's his ability to perform on the back of a major which he's either not played in or not contended for which really piques my interest.
McGirt,  ->  positive

Having signed off 2016 in the form of his life, which included an impressive Ryder Cup debut, it’s been a difficult start to 2017 for Koepka, one of the many Nike-branded players who now have licence to experiment with their equipment. Koepka has thrown in some Mizuno, Titleist and Taylor Made to an eclectic bag and it’s probably not helped in terms of finding consistency, although the fundamental reason for his poor play appears to be a bad habit he says he shook off thanks to some long range sessions at Bay Hill last month.

2017 has seen Sung-hoon finish 2nd in Houston, where he was beaten by Russell Henley, and Kang was also in the heat of the battle at TPC Potomac when a rainstorm and no wet gear destroyed his momentum - he eventually finished 5th. RESULT: MC  Brian Stuard 0.5pt EW 125/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I'll finish with Brian Stuard who clearly gets El Camaleon and who's undoubtedly on the upward trend. Stuard is a typical case of a PGA Tour journeyman who certainly dined out on his 2016 Zurich Classic of New Orleans victory.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

The Australian finished T4 at the 2015 US Open when just 21 and although the spotlight has moved away he’s been playing some excellent golf of late. Smith finished last season with a second place at the Nationwide Childern’s Hospital Championship on the Web.com Final Series, a result good enough to regain his playing rights. That provided a springboard to the new season and Smith has capitalised with 8/10 cuts made and over $400,000 in earnings.
Smith  ->  positive

Danny Lee  World Golf Ranking (#81)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,400)    The defending champ(2015) comes back to defend his title and comes in with some top 5 form in the field. Like Lingmerth he hasn't missed a cut since the PLAYERS and has picked up all three of his 2017 Top 10 finishes since then. From a stats perspective, Lee ranks Top 20 in SG: APP, SG:P, and ranks 9th on the sheet in BoB%.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again. "I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either," Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major.
Stenson  ->  negative

That being said the Salary Vs. Vegas Odds chart brings us the likes of Jimmy Walker who at roughly 60:1 odds is only $7,000 and on the surface seems underpriced. I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different. My only concern with Walker is whether or not he can stay out of trouble on what seems to be a course that requires some level of accuracy.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

The hope is he can take another step forward here at Copperhead, where he was an impressive 16th on debut in 2012, towards the start of a rookie campaign which saw him climb to the fringes of the world’s top 50 thanks to a number of impressive weeks. You can see how close Cauley came to elite level but, still 10 days short of his 27th birthday, time is on his side and this tournament gives him a genuine chance to kick off a week of celebrations with his first PGA Tour win. As well as that top-20 here when arriving out of form, Cauley has a fourth-place finish in the Arnold Palmer Invitational to his name and having in fact been born in Florida before basing himself in Alabama, this is very much a home game.
Cauley  ->  positive

He strung together four top-10 finishes last month but struggled to maintain that form. The thing I love about Cauley is he’s gaining a lot of strokes off-the-tee and on approach shots. This means that one hot week with the putter could secure his first PGA Tour win.
Cauley  ->  positive

Will consider for cash. Peasants  Sean O’Hair $7,300  Brandon Stone $7,000  Jhonattan Vegas $6,900  Martin Flores $6,600  Ryan Brehm $6,400  In the middle of writing this I got word that FanDuel will be adding golf on their site. Rumor is that they will have a weird format where you pick 2 teams, one for Thursday/Friday and another for Saturday/Sunday.
Ryan Brehm  ->  positive

They don't appear to correlate visually but all three venues reward excellent ball striking and short games and form at the three courses crosses over really well...  David Toms, Kenny Perry, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson and Jordan Spieth have all recently won this title and the John Deere Classic, staged at Deere Run in Illinois and Brandt Snedeker and Tim Clark have both finished runner-up at both tournaments. Johnson has won this title twice recently so of the eight men to win the last eight editions, four have also won the US Masters - Johnson, Spieth, Adam Scott and Phil Mickelson. Is There an Identikit Winner?
Johnson  ->  positive

In reality, I think it's a mistake if he falls outside the top 6 drafted golfers this week. Rodgers has posted birdie rates better than the field in four of his last five starts and also avoided bogeys at a higher rate than the field in six straight starts. He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Casey should be fresh and ready to continue playing great golf this week. DraftKings Value Pick  Lucas Glover ($8,600)  Glover is playing great golf this year, posting two top 20s in his last four starts. Glover posted a 28th and an 8th in his last two Wells Fargo events, and he also posted a 21stat the Honda this season.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Ranks first in scrambling on tour and was 1st in strokes gained: tee to green last week in Houston. Justin Rose ($9,200): Outside of Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose might have the most impressive record at Augusta over the past few seasons. Rose has now made nine straight cuts at the Masters since 2007 and has gone 10th-2nd-14th here over the past three years.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Moore frustrated me just a few weeks when having eulogised over him in my preview for the Valspar he promptly missed the cut, before duly popping up with a top 5 next time out at Bay Hill. As I said in my Valspar preview though I do believe Moore has what it takes to deliver at the higher levels of golf and I am encouraged by the way he has rededicated himself to achieve his ultimate goals over the next 5yrs of his career. The results to his change of coach and new fitness regime have been fairly immediate with two top tens in his last four starts and he now returns to a venue he clearly loves and which he firmly believes he can win at.
Moore  ->  positive

However, he’s a total cash game lock at that price. Player to avoid:  Branden Grace $8,200 – Grace is a low ball hitter that won’t have the carry distance needed to contend at Quail Hollow. Plus, conditions look to be softer with the rain so the course could get really long for the South African.
Grace  ->  negative

3. Jon Rahm -- An Arizona State guy, Rahm was top five here last year as an amateur. He's learned a lot about winning and contending since then, including actually doing it last weekend.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
Kirk's  ->  positive

He's now up to 45th. Number one on that same list was Jon Rahm, with Tommy Fleetwood third - last week's winners on the PGA and European Tours. Brian Harman is also high up so it seems that those who flourished in 2017 have made fast starts this year.
Jon Rahm,  ->  positive

We won’t have too much exposure in GPPs just due to our more balanced approach this week, but he’s as much a lock to finish well as any player in the field. Value Plays:  Patrick Cantlay $8,100 – Cantlay may still be relatively unknown to those that don’t keep up with the PGA Tour as much as those likely reading this article. However, he’s a stud.
Cantlay  ->  positive

Ryan Moore and Kevin Na are both affordable high floor plays under $10k, while Billy Horschel, Luke Donald and Jason Dufner all have high made-cut rates and nice course histories under the $8k mark. Tournaments: Russell Henley (see write-up below) is definitely high on my list this week for GPPs, and he’s rarely more than 10% owned. In the $8-$9k range we find Webb Simpson, Graham DeLaet and Bubba Watson who are all capable of high finishes here.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

3. Jamie Lovemark, $7,700  A long-hitting, volatile player with upside, Lovemark has strung together some nice rounds lately. It included back-to-back 69s on Thursday-Friday at the U.S. Open, a 10th-place finish at Memorial and an 18th at Byron Nelson.
Jamie Lovemark,  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

Eight of the eighteen holes are Par 4s between 400 and 500 yards. Key Stats:  DraftKings Points  Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  Proximity (175+ Yards)  Par 4 Scoring (400-500 Yards)  Par 3 Scoring  Strokes Gained: Putting (Bermuda)  Expensive Golfers ($10,000 and Up)  Justin Thomas ($11,300) seems primed for a victory here. Since missing the cut at The Open Championship last year, he’s made 12 starts.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

He's got some good form in the other Hawaii event and is playing the Plantation Course for the first time in 2013. Leishman was only 23rd back then but it gave him a first look at the course and he's a vastly improved player five years on. Thomas, incidentally, won last year having finished 21st in 2016 so you only have to go back 12 months to find an example to help Leishman's cause.
Leishman  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

- current odds here . My selections are as follows:  Rickie Fowler 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  You get the feeling that Rickie Fowler means business right now. 2017 saw Fowler play second fiddle to his Jupiter, Florida comrades Dustin Johnson (World Number 1), Brooks Koepka (World Number 8) and Justin Thomas (World Number 3) who between them amassed 11 victories last year including the U.S. Open, PGA Championship and 2 World Golf Championships.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms. Jason Day has had a rocky start to 2017 with one top 10 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and a missed cut.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Hideki Matsuyama went off 12/1 for the last major championship  That has to be taken on board, and he was never in the mix at Bay Hill on his return, but three rounds at the Match Play will have helped speed up his recovery and he showed much better signs in all of them, particularly from tee-to-green. After his victory on Thursday, Matsuyama told reporters, "I really found my game - it was a great day out there" and, much like Spieth last week, it could just be that things have clicked in the nick of time. Granted, Matsuyama didn't get out of his group in Texas but the combination of match practice and a further two weeks to reach full fitness and finalise his Augusta practice makes him interesting, as a player who has built up that bank of Masters form, who ranked tied-sixth for greens hit last year along with Thomas, and who looks an obvious candidate to become the fourth player in succession to win their first major here.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Russel Knox ($8,200) – Knox is just another golfer with supreme talent who is priced down in a big way. At $8,200, Russell Knox is one of my favorite plays this week. He ranked 8th in Driving Accuracy Percentage and 9th in Greens in Regulation Percentage in 2016.
Knox  ->  positive

He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
List  ->  positive

22nd at Augusta, when he went into the final round in 4th spot, 8th at Erin Hills when in the mix all week and 20th last week at Royal Birkdale highlight a player who's having a stellar year. 4th at Riviera, 2nd at Bay Hill and 3rd last month at TPC River Highlands again highlight Hoffman as a player to watch this week and on a potentially receptive, classical golf course where scoring is more than possible, I really like his chances this week. 28th here in 2008, improving results of 16th (2013) and 7th (2015) have followed and it's noticeable that Charley is particularly comfortable on the greens here with +1.10 (2008), +0.88 (2013) and +1.37 (2015) Strokes Gained Putting performances.
Hoffman  ->  positive

2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Ryan Palmer, Scott Piercy, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Keegan Bradley, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, J.B. Holmes, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Satoshi Kodaira, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Jon Rahm, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Steve Stricker, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Jhonattan Vegas, Johnson Wagner, Nick Watney, Bubba Watson, Gary Woodland. Trends in terms of recent winners are interesting to say the very least and that's hardly surprising at a tournament where the average odds of the winner since 2010 sits at 109/1 and across the last 4 years at a staggering 167/1.
Kevin Kisner,  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Brian Harman, Zach Johnson, Webb Simpson, Jim Furyk, Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Adam Hadwin, Emiliano Grillo, Cameron Smith, Kevin Streelman and Matt Kuchar. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Waste Management Phoenix Open / Maybank Championship and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

The elite putting (6th), short (35th), and sand (5th) game has returned, and he’s cleaning up on Par 3s (21st) at the moment. Justin Thomas, Russell Knox, Charles Howell III & Kevin Kisner – Thomas has won two of his last four starts and almost broke through at this site last season (T3)… Knox enters with four T20s in his past five tournaments, with just a lone result outside the Top 3 in three appearances at the Honda Classic (T23 in 2016). The Scot is also seventh in Ball Striking, fifth in birdie average, and Top 25 in Par 3, 4 & 5 scoring… After being the chalk play through the West Coast Swing, many are ready to dump CH3 due to his newfound proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

From a pure betting perspective, 30-1 on Ryan Moore is great value. In one appearance at Silverado, Moore finished 10th. Moore in a West Coast specialist, and we’ve seen him have success on poa annua greens and in the Fall Swing.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

His price was 8/1. So coming off a runner-up position at Copperhead on course debut last week, where he fell a single shot short of forcing a playoff with Paul Casey (now that would have been interesting), I think that Woods is in a great space to produce what pretty much all of us want to see: his 80th PGA Tour victory and the end of a long and arduous fight back from a catalogue of career-threatening injuries. 8th and 9th for ball-striking across his 2 Florida outings, Woods tightened up his driving last week in Tampa.
Woods  ->  positive

Even though we haven’t seen his best golf for a while, Lovemark is still ranked 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green and has accumulated seven top-10s in the past year and a half on tour. With this sort of pedigree, and a game possibly on the upswing, this is a great time to buy low on Lovemark, as he has plenty of upside for the price we are getting this week on DraftKings. I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is wavegoodbye) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Naturally also look for a comfortable Poa Annua putter as putting from inside 10 feet here is always the toughest on Tour. Winners : 2017: Dustin Johnson (-17); 2016: Bubba Watson (-15); 2015: James Hahn (-6); 2014: Bubba Watson (-15); 2013: John Merrick (-11); 2012: Bill Haas (-7); 2011: Aaron Baddeley (-12); 2010: Steve Stricker (-16). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for The Northern Trust. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Dustin Johnson ($10,800)  DJ hasn’t been in the best for this summer, but he played well enough in the last two majors to intrigue me. After injuring his back and missing the Masters, it’s been a tough road back to the top, but DJ is close.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Per our Trends tool, DJ has averaged 65.17 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) and generated a -0.73 Plus/Minus in his last three trips to this track. That said, Johnson’s heavy 12.5 percent odds to win are currently the best in the field. Newlywed Swag  Unlike Johnson, the newly-married Rory McIlroy has thrived in recent trips to TPC Sawgrass.
Johnson’s  ->  positive

He finished T20 at the Safeway Open, his first start of the season and on his most recent start, at the RSM Classic finished T6. Lovemark shot a final-round 65 to finish just three shots shy of the five players who made it to a sudden-death play-off. If history repeats itself he’s in with a shot this week.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter.
Justin Thomas;  ->  positive

Since then, Scott Stallings, Ted Potter Jr, Jonas Blixt and Angel Cabrera have been winners. Last season, New Zealand’s Danny Lee won a four-man playoff over David Hearn, Kevin Kisner and Robert Streb. The win also earned Lee a place in the field for The Open Championship.
Lee  ->  positive

It looks like he is well on track to start playing at the top of his game, and it showed during the first two rounds of the WGC where he was tied for third on the leaderboard entering the weekend. Value Plays  Daniel Berger  Daniel Berger ($7,700)  Berger has great form coming into the PGA Championship, placing top 5 in three of his last five events, including a win defending his title at The St Jude. He was T13 at the WGC Bridgestone going into the weekend when this article was published.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

This season Streelman ranks 11th in total driving, 18th in SG: T2G and fourth in scrambling. Bargain Bin    Dylan Frittelli - $13,400    Frittelli will be making his Valero Texas Open debut this week, but the South African is familiar with the Texan style of golf after playing collegiately as a Longhorn at UT-Austin. The 51st-ranked player in the OWGR doesn’t enter with very inspiring recent form after finishes of T32-MC-MC in his past three starts, but he led the field in SG: Off-the-Tee and ranked 10th in SG: T2G at Harbour Town last week.
Dylan Frittelli  ->  positive

In ten starts at this course, Casey has never finished worse than 23rd (2015) and he has posted eight top-10 finishes in that span, including a 4th in 2011. You have to go back to the Sony Open in January for Casey’s last missed cut and he has finished in the top-5 on five separate occasions since. Three of those five top-5’s came during the FedEx Cup play-offs with a T33 finish at the BMW Championship the only result dampening such an excellent run of form.
Casey  ->  positive

When Spieth sets goals, he generally achieves them. As a past champ here (2015), this is as good of spot as any to pick up that W.  Henrik Stenson ($11,600): It's been love at first sight for the Swede and Copperhead. He posted a solo fourth in his 2015 debut and has since returned to collect two more finishes of T11 or better.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

More specifically, he can hack it in Texas. Suri nearly won his group in the WGC-Matchplay at Austin Country Club, but he finished behind eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Suri was the only one of seven opponents that Bubba didn’t destroy, as he was able to halve his match.
Suri  ->  positive

He has gained strokes on approach shots in six of his last seven events. There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it.
Reed  ->  positive

I love this golf course. I've always played well around here, said Casey after his near-miss. "The crowds are great, and it's just nice to get an opportunity to win this, and maybe one day I can get my name in the clubhouse.
Casey  ->  positive

The price is going up but I think we can still consider him in all formats. Who the Stats Like  Chesson Hadley  World Golf Ranking (#80)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($9,000)  FanDuel ($8,700)    After losing his Tour card in 2016, Hadley won twice on the Web.com Tour last year and is back with the big boys and looking good. He started the fall season with three straight Top 5 finishes before withdrawing from the OHL Classic(illness).
Hadley  ->  positive

He should be limited to GPP only on FanDuel where he is in the mid $10K range. Top Current Form Targets  Cameron Smith  World Golf Ranking (#58)  Vegas Odds (66/1)  Draftkings ($7,400)  FanDuel ($9,200)    Consistency plus DraftKings value is brought me back to Cameron Smith this week. After picking up just six Top 25's all of his rookie season, he has already posted five in his first five events to start the 2017-18 season including two Top 10 finishes and ranks 7th in the field in DraftKings scoring over his last 24 rounds.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Half a career grand slam and more than one near-miss is some return for a 23-year-old who hasn't yet played in 20 majors, so it's hard to argue with his price - especially considering the problems facing various potential dangers. Sky Bet special: Any of Spieth/Harman/Ellis/Matsuyama/Grace or Leishman to win - 6/1! Fowler, for instance, still has to show that he can put the pieces together on Sunday.
Leishman  ->  positive

Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 3: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m); 4: Jason Day ($11.6m); 5: Justin Rose ($9.2m); 6: Brandt Snedeker ($10.0m); 7: Pat Perez ($7.3m); 8: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 9: Jimmy Walker ($8.8m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.5m). Predictor Positives : With bad weather forecast for the opening 36 holes, you'd like the chances of U.S. Open, Open Championship and Pebble Beach specialist Dustin Johnson at $11.8 million.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Howell would have advanced to the Quarterfinals of last week’s Match Play if it weren’t for a last-minute comeback effort from Kiradech Aphibarnrat in the Round of 16, while Howell also place top-15 the week prior at the API. James Hahn - $13,400    Hahn still hasn’t missed a single cut all season, posting a quartet of top-30s in his past eight starts as well. He’s made it through to the weekend in 75 percent of his appearances at the Golf Club of Houston’s Tournament Course, while he currently ranks 14th in SG: Approach, 36th in birdie average and 38th in proximity.
James Hahn  ->  positive

One other point to note with Henley is that he was seventh in the St Jude Classic last season and, as I’ve mentioned before, I really like that as a form pointer. Among the players to help draw comparisons between these two events is Robert Garrigus, who has to go in at 150/1. Garrigus famously lost the plot to hand the St Jude Classic to Lee Westwood in 2010, and he’s been placed here at Copperhead on two of his last four visits.
Garrigus,  ->  positive

Moore in a West Coast specialist, and we’ve seen him have success on poa annua greens and in the Fall Swing. In one appearance at Silverado, Moore finished 10th. From a pure betting perspective, 30-1 on Ryan Moore is great value.
Moore  ->  positive

Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.

Jason Dufner;  ->  positive

Fowler has all facets of his game dialed in, especially his approach game, which ranks 4th in the field entering this event. Even though his course history has been boom or bust, I am rostering Fowler in cash and will roster him on 30%-40% of my lineups. Adam Scott – $8,400  Adam Scott should not be $8,400 and he should not, not, be put into your cash game lineup.
Fowler  ->  positive

Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9500 FD: $9200  He’s got to win eventually right? Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics. Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts.

A year later, Herman returns to defend his title along with, not only those aforementioned elite names, but an entire cavalcade of top-end players looking to get in some final prep for the quickly-approaching trek to Augusta: DJ (1) (Withdrew Monday), Stenson (5), Jordan Spieth (6), Adam Scott (7), and Rickie Fowler (9) comprise the Top 10 contingent, while Patrick Reed (12), Justin Rose (13), Jon Rahm (14), Phil Mickelson (19), Matt Kuchar (21), Jimmy Walker (24), and Rafa Cabrera Bello (26) represent the Top 30 in the world rankings. Overall, there are 31 players in Houston who have already qualified for the Masters, and four of them, all European Tour members, have received a sponsor’s invite to pad the strength of this field a little more.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The field consists of 78 entrants: 60 from the PGA Tour FedEx Cup standings, 10 from the Asian Tour’s Order of Merit, and eight sponsor’s exemptions. Look for the no-cut event to yield low scores and perhaps a Justin Thomas three-peat, which would be the first on the PGA Tour since Steve Stricker three-peated the John Deere Classic from 2009-2011.

All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he'll be in contention. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Zach Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($6,600)  Sometimes, it's easiest to just not overthink things when it comes to how DraftKings prices golfers each week. I wrote about Hadwin last week and he produced value yet again. This week, his price is even lower for an event where he has posted consecutive top-25 finishes.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Every week is both always and never a Keegan week. https://t.co/d9PvoDStVh
Keegan  ->  negative

In three starts at this course, Finau missed his first two cuts, before finishing 5th here last season, largely thanks to a final round 64. Finau will be looking to join Woodland as a bomber to break the mould here at Copperhead and buck the trend of shorter winners getting their name on the trophy here. His missed cut at the Phoenix Open was his first of the season and his only one so far, and he bounced back with a T2 finish at the Genesis Open on his next start.
Finau  ->  positive

Adding to his recent event form, Harman also finished 8th at Q-School when it was hosted here in 2011 so it is fair to say he has an affinity with the setup here. With five straight top-8 finishes which include four top-5’s, it is now time for Harman to capitalise on some special form. Harman has made huge strides as a player over the last couple of years and whilst his win at the Wells Fargo was just his second on the PGA Tour, and his first for three years, he now looks ready to become a perennial winner on Tour.
Harman  ->  positive

Almost two years later, he won by three in 16-under and in-between those efforts, he shot to fame by contending for the US Open at Oakmont before falling to a more than respectable share of 15th having made his way through sectional qualifying. It was no surprise to see him coast through the Web.com Tour last season and Landry has already done just about enough to keep hold of his card for 2019, finishing fourth in the RSM Classic before taking Jon Rahm the distance at the CareerBuilder Challenge, an event which is much more demanding than used to be the case. Bar those two efforts it had otherwise been a disappointing start to the year for the 30-year-old, but he had more on his mind with the arrival of his first child imminent.
Landry  ->  positive

Given his ranking of 16th in Strokes Gained: Putting in the early going this year, he’s a good bet to be in the mix Sunday afternoon. Russell Henley, $9,800 – Henley out-birdied Tim Clark for his first PGA Tour win at Waialae back in 2013, and since has notched a couple more top-17s, proving his win wasn’t a fluke. Henley is a strong fit for this venue given his strong balance of distance and accuracy off the tee combined with solid putting.
Henley,  ->  positive

Most of my lineups will have Casey on them. Adam Scott ($8,800) – Seriously, why is Adam Scott priced in the 8k range whenever there is a strong field. Scott has 3 top 15’s in his last 4 tries here to go with a win back in 2011.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

La Quinta, set in the Californian desert, looks a very obvious place for him to reach a crescendo. Since the rotation of two rounds at PGA West's Stadium Course, one at the Nicklaus Tournament Course and one at La Quinta CC came in two years ago, Harman has thrived. He shot 18-under to take T11 in 2016 and matched that 72-hole total for third place last year.
Harman  ->  positive

Back JJ Henry 1u @ [1000.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [50.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [15.0]  Back JJ Henry for a Top 20 Finish 1.5u @ [8.0]    If Si Woo Kim can win the Fifth Major from the maximum odds of [1000.0], so too can this Texan course specialist! You have to go back a few years but Henry has plenty of course form, with third place in 2012 the best of four top-13 finishes. The 42-year-old has always been the type to pop up in serious contention every so often at enormous odds.
Henry  ->  positive

He’s accurate off-the-tee, a fantastic iron player, and one of the best putters on Tour. Although we target bombers here, Harman seemed to solve the riddle of Torrey Pines last year, posting a 9th place finish. He’s playing the best golf of his career, and I’m a believer in his talent and grit.
Harman  ->  positive

All things considered, Rory is my top fantasy pick of the week and safe in all formats. Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#13)  Vegas Odds (22/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)  FanDuel ($10,900)  Ranked even higher in my overall model(#1) is Paul Casey as he is the only player in the field who ranks Top 10 in all four categories on my sheet(stats, history, form & DK average last 5). It starts with the course history as Casey has now finished 6th or better in three straight Masters appearances and for his career has made eight of 11 cuts with five Top 10 finishes.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
Smith  ->  negative

Over and over, he's proven to be incredibly reliable, having never missed the cut here in 17 starts and usually finishing inside of the top 30. I was hesitant going into Pebble Beach as he had missed three straight cuts to start 2018, but a 26th place bounce back finish last week has me feeling confident that we can get one more solid effort here out of Choi, which we will need in order to fit DJ in at the top of our lineups this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Ollie Schniederjans  Ollie Schniederjans arrives at the Genesis Open with a great deal of momentum after finishing the Waste Management Phoenix Open with a bogey-free six-under 66 in the final round.
Choi,  ->  positive

The stats show that he's finished second and first in Scrambling for the last two weeks. He's also putting well (3rd SG Putting Phoenix, 19th SGP Pebble) although Mickelson being Mickelson he still can't hide his obsession with driving distance. "I've really had to increase speed to hang with a lot of the younger guys," he said at Pebble.
Mickelson  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Kevin Chappell 2pts EW 28/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here:  One that I like at the top of the market is Kevin Chappell. Steady and motivated after winning his maiden Tour victory at TPC San Antonio back in March, Chappell is a class act in my mind and his results over the past 18 months have been top-notch.
Chappell  ->  positive

I'm sitting here disappointed." Before his second place, Reed had banked a top five in the Travelers Championship in Connecticut (another course in the northeast of the U.S.) and even made an albatross when posting a top 20 in the European Open in Germany at the end of July. You get the feeling another win is around the corner and the return to New York - Reed's kind of town - could just get him over the line.
Reed  ->  positive

Can't get behind Na, either; he's missed the weekend his past three trips here, and his only performance of note (T-9) came in 2007. As for Spieth, Day and McIlroy: they definitely aren't my favorites. Spieth's flat stick continues to be an issue, and though River Highlands' greens will be a respite from the Open dance floors, he's not shown the type of putting consistency that instills conviction.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Pre-event pick, Scott Piercy, sits tied for 30th and five off the lead and he looks to have too much on his plate but James Hahn is close enough if good enough on -8 and I'm happy I followed Paul Krishnamurty in with his three Find Me a 100 Winner selections. Michael Thompson is alongside Piercy after a disappointing second round but Chesson Hadley and Grayson Murray are both alongside Hahn in a tie for 11th and I'm just going to cheer those on for now. 09:35 - March 30, 2017  A weather delay yesterday morning has meant round one of the Houston Open is yet to be completed and that's always frustrating when trying to assess the state of play.
Piercy,  ->  positive

BOTTOM TIER TARGET ($6K/$7K RANGE)  Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports  Russell Knox ($7,100)  The chalk is clearly falling on Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Adam Scott, and Jhonattan Vegas in this range which gives us a few GPP pivot options. I start with Knox as he come sback to TPC Boston with a nice record finishing T26, T12, T15 in his only three trips here. It is a very risky pick as Knox has not been having a good year with just four Top 10 finishes but is clearly comfortable around here.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

Six starts, never has finished better than T-46. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Kevin Kisner. Runner-up here in 2015 and his game is such a good fit for Harbour Town.
Kevin Kisner.  ->  positive

I was counting all my money on Thursday and figuring out how it would be spent, only to watch in horror as guys went over par on Friday afternoon to completely ruin the week. I myself put way too much stock in Casey, who lost his putter Thursday going -4 SG: Putting, which is historically awful. Anyway, like I said last week it is early and we don’t know exactly how these guys are playing so I hope you went light.
Casey,  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months. Rory McIlroy, $11700 – Rory has only played once at Riviera (T20 back in 2016), but his incredibly ability to drive the ball and hit solid irons should net him plenty of birdie potential on Riviera.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?
Matt Kuchar  ->  negative

But wait a minute. Is Hoffman the prohibitive favorite in our format? In one sense, very much so.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Daniel Berger has a similar profile to Harman but the same can be said of Kisner and Dufner – so many ball-strikers that come to the fore when bombing is taking out of the equation. However, the final vote goes to Tom Hoge. Catching the eye when leading the Sony through 16 holes of the final round, he hasn’t confirmed that form quite yet, whilst still not disgracing himself.
Tom Hoge.  ->  positive

So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.
Reed.  ->  positive

Zach Turcotte: Luke Donald ($7,600)  The tour moves to Florida this week and with that, a lot of players will be headed back home, one being Luke Donald. Donald, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, has been very successful at PGA National over the years. He has posted four top-10 finishes and never missed a cut in six starts at the course.
Donald  ->  positive

And, of course, there was the little matter of landing the $10million bonus that goes to the winner of the season-long FedEx Cup points race. Along with all his other attributes, Spieth also seems very adept at leaving something in the tank for this time of year. He was runner-up on his very first Tour Championship appearance in 2013 and so far during the 2017 Playoffs he's finished second at both The Northern Trust and Dell Technologies Championship before closing with a 65 for tied seventh in last week's BMW Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter

Statswise he ranks sixth in driving accuracy, 31st in GIR and 20th in par 4 scoring.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico. Blair has missed his last two cuts overall but I would still feel OK rostering him at his price this week as he generally makes more cuts than he misses and finished 38th here back in 2015, his only visit to this tournament. Others: Ryan Brehm  High-upside GPP Picks  Thorbjorn Olesen ($7,700): Olesen has multiple European tour wins to his name and has generally been a great finisher over his young career.
Blair  ->  positive

Dufner's game fits nicely, and he has shown that with his success here over the years. In his past nine appearances here, Dufner has not finished outside the top 30 once, and during that time, he has posted four top-20s. In his past five tournaments this year, Dufner has made every cut and posted three top-20s.
Dufner  ->  positive

Haas cracked top 10 last year at Troon while Dufner has made five straight British Open cuts. Fade: Jason Day. Not the same Jason Day that we’re used to right now.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week. Jeff Bergerson: Ben Crane ($6,500) on DraftKings  In weaker fields like this week's Puerto Rico Open, I love looking at our Sportsbook Odds vs. Daily Pricing Tool on our site to help me find the best value plays. One of those great values that is revealed is Ben Crane at $6,800.
Ben Crane  ->  positive

As long as he can steer clear of Rae’s Creek and any lingering demons from last year’s collapse, Spieth will make an excellent play in guaranteed prize pools this year, even as one of the highest-salaried golfers in the field. With his history at Augusta and current form, Spieth seems poised to make another run at a green jacket this year. He is off to a great start this year and is poised to eclipse the massive numbers he posted in the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.
Spieth  ->  positive

If he gets the putter rolling he will certainly be one to watch here. Patrick Reed 11/1  Reed had a great finish to the season with a win and four top 15 finishes from the last seven tournaments. He finished T11 at the Travelers and followed that with another T11 in Rio and a respectable T22 at The Wyndham.
Reed  ->  positive

The weather looks to be mild with very little wind so scoring should be low with the winner averaging around the 20 under mark judging from previous years. Jordan Spieth 5/1  Spieth has been in decent form coming into this event winning in Australia in his last official start beating Ashley Hall and Cameron Smith in a dramatic playoff. The young American played well in the FedExCup Playoffs finishing T10 at The Barclays, solo ninth at The BMW and T17 at The Tour Championship.
Spieth  ->  positive

After his brilliance at the US Open, where he finished fourth, a respectable sixth in Germany just seven days later, victory in the Open de France and a very fair 10th in Ireland two weeks ago, Fleetwood is one of the hottest golfers in the field. It's hard to envisage Fleetwood not contending but I just wonder whether strong home expectations might pile on a bit too much pressure. This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

There were just too many errors from him at inopportune moments but he plugged away and a couple of late birdies on Sunday on the way to finishing in a tie for 15th at least got a cheer or two from the galleries. Whether his focus was not quite where it should have been with a US Open just around the corner or simply down to an off-week, Wiesberger is much better than that and I expect to see a positive response. He is a winner already this season on the European Tour in China and the way he plays the game should be ideal for the challenge ahead with his ability to cut some of these punishing holes down to size.
Wiesberger  ->  positive

Brendan has gone low around here over the last few years shooting 62 in round one in 2014, a 66 in the final round in 2013 and a 64 in the final round last year. With a great record here and good current form, Steele looks a good shout here. Final selections –  Justin Thomas 14/1 1pt EW  Marc Leishman 30/1 0.5pts EW  Brandt Snedeker 28/1 0.5pts EW  Brendan Steele 30/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on Twitter @DoublebogeyDB6  Like my Facebook page www.facebook.com/doublebogey6

Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that. The Brit has a lethal combination of recent form and course form, and he brings an exceptionally good value.
Rose  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Jordan Spieth ($11,600) – The kid absolutely thrives under adversity, and given just how nasty the adversity may get this week, Spieth would be my best bet to shine regardless of the conditions. He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam.
Spieth  ->  positive

Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor. Thomas Pieters ($7300): Pieters has had an excellent track record at WGCs, finishing 23rd/14th/5th in his only attempts, and absolutely stripes the ball. That distance will help him make up the few times where he can get wild off the tee, and it’s really on approach where Pieters’ true talents show out.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

That momentum didn’t quite carry over the 2017 calendar year and so far he has let a lot of people down on DraftKings. However, Casey fits this course perfectly, and has the Augusta narrative working in his favor. Casey came second here in 2015 and has back-to-back top 6 results at the Masters.
Casey  ->  positive

Also Consider - Harold Varner III  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Trey Mullinax  Vegas Odds - 200/1  Draftkings - $6,500  FantasyAces - $4,000    I love taking a rookie in this spot as he will most likely be extremely low owned. Oh ya and Mullinax has a tremendous amount of talent and through watching interviews, seems to have it together between the ears. PGA Tour pro Michael Thompson, who had the same college coach, went as far as to say Mullinax's raw power is best compared to Dustin Johnson.
Mullinax  ->  positive

However, I expect the elite names to dominate, with DJ, Thomas and Rahm all likely threats to my chosen front two of Spieth and Rose while Simpson can hopefully get in amongst it too. He shot 63-67 on the weekend three years ago and 69-67 last year so if the big-hitting, two-time PGA Tour winner gets off to a better start he could be dangerous. Further down the betting, I quite like Gary Woodland at 60/1 given his positive past course experience which shows top 10s in both 2016 and 2014.
Simpson  ->  positive

Some lists…. Top five finishers in last 6 Opens  2016 (Royal Troon): 1 Henrik Stenson, 2 Phil Mickelson, T3 J.B.

Louis Oosthuizen,  ->  positive

5. Patrick Cantlay  Ladies and gents, meet the next generation’s Paul Casey. Albeit delayed a few years due to injury, Cantlay burst on the PGA scene in 2018 with all of the composure of a long-time veteran, making the cut in literally every event he played (13/13) with eight top-25 finishes and four top-tens.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

He was in-contention for much of last week and he was second here in both 2010 and 2012 and he also has a great record at the aforementioned Sony Open.

All three courses - Harbour Town, Sea Island and Colonial - represent good form pointers for the Sony Open. Kevin Kisner: Worth backing in Hawaii  Kisner's record here reflects his career trajectory. For years he struggled, and then something clicked as he opened with a round of 63 en route to fifth in 2016, before going one place better after a closing 65 last year.
Kisner:  ->  positive

Jim Furyk  ->  positive

1pt e/w Lanto Griffin at 400/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) There have been surprise winners of this event before, so why not Griffin. This is obviously a massive step-up in class but his win last year at the Nashville Open kicked off a run of good form and two weeks ago he impressed with a T12 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
Griffin  ->  positive

In the end you have to wonder if Rose was not only playing Garcia, but also the golfing gods that day and his play-off defeat certainly hit Justin hard in the aftermath, despite his best denials. However 10th at Glen Oaks, 10th at TPC Boston on a layout he struggles on and 2nd last week at Conway Farms highlights that Rose has momentum that only Spieth and Rahm can match. Whilst I wonder about Rahm on Bermudagrass greens, I have no hesitation in adding Rose to my betting slip this week as his record at the strategic East Lake is excellent.
Rose  ->  positive

Johnson finished 15th here last season, which isn’t good when there’s only 18 golfers, but he has ripped off three wins and an additional six top-10 finishes in 12 tournaments since the start of June. Jordan Spieth ($10,300): Spieth won the Australian Open two weeks ago and has the second-best Odds to Win (14.3 percent) this week. Spieth dunked it on the Par-3 second hole here last year, earning the all-important DraftKings hole-in-one bonus on his way to a fourth-place finish.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

If I were to rank these players I would go – Thomas, Spieth, Fowler, DJ. There is, however, one player in the high salary range that I really like and should be paired with one of those players –  Players  Marc Leishman (Draftkings – $9,000, FanDuel – $10,000)  Marc is coming off of a 4th place finish in the Australian PGA Championship which took place in early December. He is a very hot golfer right now and has been dominant in the stat department over his last 24 PGA Tour rounds.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

He's hitting fairways and greens right now and with an average 312 yards per drive that's the green light for me to include him this week. Day rates 2nd in my classical golf course ratings (behind only Dustin Johnson) and 11th for Scoring Average, 6th for Birdie or Better Conversion and 3rd for par-4 Birdie or Better Conversion are also key stats I like this week. Has masses of correlating course form across the likes of Kapalua, Bay Hill, Houston, Quail Hollow, TPC Four Seasons, Congressional, Firestone, Bethpage Black, TPC Boston as well as East Lake and we also know that Day has the experience to handle changing conditions this week.
Day  ->  positive

RESULT: MC  Bubba Watson 1pt EW 45/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  So the blueprint for Bethpage Black is for longer hitters who are hitting plenty of greens and who like Poa Annua. Step forward Bubba Watson whose career results look very similar to 2012 victor Nick Watney. Yes, Watson has had his troubles in 2016 (he's only 24th in the FEC standings) and after a blistering February where he won at Riviera and was 2nd at Doral, he's been very quiet.
Bubba Watson  ->  positive

Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
Rickie Fowler.  ->  negative

DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Kevin Na ($9,500) – If you can believe it, this is actually an event Kevin Na won back in 2011 with a ridiculous score of -23, and it’s easy to see why. If length is taken out of the equation, Na has one of the best combinations of iron play and putting in the game. He’s a great value at this price.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

Daniel Berger - Daniel Berger has finished 16th or better in two of his last three events, which includes last week in Mexico. Berger has now made the cut in six of his last eight events and is 13th in birdie average. Berger also finished 11th last year in the Valspar Championship and should feel at home in this event given he’s from Plantation.
Berger  ->  positive

He has had a slow start to the 2017 season but I think his performance at the Masters gets him going the rest of the way. Chappell is a capable Par 5 scorer and has shown upside at the Valero Texas Open by finishing T4 here last year. His putting can be inconsistent at times which makes him an ideal golfer for your round 1-2 lineup this week on FanDuel.
Chappell  ->  positive

Palmer  ->  positive

His game travels well and he always brings a lot of confidence in windy conditions. Pat Perez ($9,400): Speaking of wind, the ASU product has the highest differential in terms of WIND performance versus BASELINE performance, since 2014. He's more than 1/3 of a stroke better per round when the wind is 14 MPH or stronger.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Brandon Hagy  3. Luke List  MY PICK : Hideki Matsuyama ($10,200)  Hideki’s form has turned around of late as he’s now finished inside the top-15 in each of his last three starts, and he looks to be close to the level of play which vaulted him up the world rankings in late 2016. Matsuyama ranks second in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee this season and is also second on tour in Par 4 Scoring, two stats which line him up for a nice week at Firestone.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

5 PGA Tour victories for Moore shows that he can get the job done on his given day and undoubtedly Ryan will be motivated to keep the recent momentum going as at 71st in the OWGR he needs a strong performance to get a spot in the Dell World Match Play. Moore topped Greens in Regulation at a windswept PGA National 2 weeks ago and was 4th for Strokes Gained Putting at Riviera the week before that where he finished 8th. Ryan shot -3/68 across Thursday/Friday to be 3rd at 36 holes, so he's clearly playing some nice stuff as 14th for Scoring Average, 35th for Bogey Avoidance, 9th for Scrambling from the Rough and 33rd for Strokes Gained Putting highlight more than adequately.
Moore  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years.
McIlroy  ->  positive

The weather forecast for KL looks mixed with rain and thunderstorms a distinct possibility. Venue: TPC Kuala Lumpur (West), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Date: Oct 12-15  Course stats: par 72, 7,005 yards  Purse: $7,000,000  Defending champion: Justin Thomas (-23)  TV Coverage:  Thursday 12 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Friday 13 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Saturday 14 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Sunday 15 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Player Watch:  Justin Thomas is obviously going to be heavy favourite but he will face strong competition. There are a number of European players who might threaten, three of those are:  Paul Casey – He was on brilliant form in the second half of the season but was unable to convert and secure a victory.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

There is no doubt in my mind that if he can have even an average week on the greens with his long game he can get in to the hunt and at 60-1 for a top 7 place I am winning to take a gamble this happens. RYAN MOORE – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 28th  I’ll be finishing my Masters staking plan with three 3 figure priced players and I’ll start these with Ryan Moore. Moore frustrated me just a few weeks when having eulogised over him in my preview for the Valspar he promptly missed the cut, before duly popping up with a top 5 next time out at Bay Hill.
Moore.  ->  positive

Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores. Campbell has the seventh-best LT Scrambling percentage (61.7) in the field, and he has made the cut here at the Old White TPC in two of three trips. He has two top-15 finishes in his last four events.
Campbell  ->  positive

Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Phil Mickelson EW @ 25/1  Despite so many new young stars making the headlines, it seems like we've gone back in time on the PGA Tour in recent weeks with Phil Mickelson showing up big in the early-season events. The left-hander has banked 19 of his 42 career titles on the West Coast and back in the part of the United States where he grew up (California) and went to college (Arizona), Mickelson is thriving again. A T5 in the Waste Management Phoenix Open followed by T2 at Pebble Beach represent his first back-to-back top fives on the PGA Tour since 2013.
Phil Mickelson  ->  positive

He’s already proven he can beat Oosthuizen whilst Dufner and Hahn are unpredictable players, who of course can get hot, but in this format, I’ll take Day every time. Rafael Cabrera Bello 66/1 (SkyBet & UniBet) 1pt e/w  So Cabrera Bello was one of the players I had in mind from the outset, but wanted to see who he would be pit against in the Group Stages first.

He does have a nice track record at this event, but his best finish -- a T-4 in 2013 -- came at another venue. As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No.
Kirk.  ->  positive

How about his stats? In this field, Finau ranks 3rd in SG-T2G, 9th in SG-App, 5th in driving distance, 4th in Par 4 scoring, 8th in Bob% and 9th in Bogey Avoidance. Shall I go on?
Finau  ->  positive

I would expect more of the same from him this week as he’s playing the best golf of his entire career. Matt Kuchar ($7,900) – Kuchar has been a little on the pricey side for his past couple events, but we now get him at a very reasonable price tag on a track that he has handled beautifully, including with a win in 2012. He makes few mistakes and like Fowler, has the right demeanor to not allow many of Sawgrass’ pitfalls to rattle him.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Rounds of -6/65 and -5/66 got him into 4th spot after 36 holes and eventually he held on for a top-10 after the course became a bomber's paradise over the weekend, qualifying for East Lake by the skin of his teeth. With momentum on his side I can see Na being right in the mix again 2 years down the line. RESULT: T53  Watch these tips on YouTube with Steve Bamford: Golf Betting System YouTube Channel

SUNG KANG – 200-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  For my final pick this week I am going to go slightly off the radar and finish with a 200-1 shot in the form of Sung Kang. One of my reasons for picking Kang this week could be considered somewhat spurious to say the least, but, as I said to someone on twitter only the other day, Page 1, Rule 1 of the Golf Betting Handbook underlined in big bold writing is ‘Follow your Hunches’! My leftfield hunch here is to do with a certain Tiger Woods.
Kang.  ->  positive

Also played well reasonably well at Augusta. Charley Hoffman – He played some great stuff at Augusta, finishing in a tie for 12th. He also made an ace on the 16th at Augusta on Sunday.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

He then had a win at The Barclays and followed that with a T5 at The Deutsche Bank. Reed also had a superb Ryder Cup for team USA winning a total of three and a half points out of five. He didn’t have the best start to the new season finishing outside the top 50 at The CIMB and WGC in China but he did bounce back with a T10 at The Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas.
Reed  ->  positive

Kang also sits 65th in Strokes Gained Putting, 59th for Birdie Average and 1st for Total Birdies across the PGA Tour this season. Result: MC  Harris English 1pt EW 70/1 with NEW OFFER!

This Dude Likes Legos  Zac Blair is not in fine form — his 71.2 Recent (Rec) Adj Rd Score ranks near the bottom of the field — but he has the type of game to get around what’s expected to be a tough course. Blair’s 68.3 LT DA percentage is second in the field, and his 60.1 LT SC percentage ranks 15th. While Blair hasn’t finished higher than 40th in his last six events, he does have 12th- and eighth-place finishes on his resume this season.

- current odds here . My selections are as follows:  Jon Rahm 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  It's the mark of the 23 year-old that Jon Rahm not only attended the CareerBuilder Challenge last week (no doubt ignoring a rather large cheque from Abu Dhabi organisers as a result), but won a tournament which hadn't seen an elite player victorious since Phil Mickelson in 2004. In doing so Rahm, as I mentioned at Kapalua when we were on-board him at 12/1, destroyed a set of well established tournament trends.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Day  ->  negative

Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past. At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago). Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead.

His T3 at the John Deere Classic came at the par 71, 7,258-yard course. Bryan struggles off of the tee distance wise but showed last year he can compete with just about anyone with a wedge in his hand. If you’re looking for a cheap GPP flier there are plenty of worse options out there.
Bryan  ->  positive

Rose will look to bounce back from a below-average putting year and taking a month off may be just what he needed. If Rose has just an average putting tournament, he will be on the first page of the leaderboard on Sunday and there is no telling how low he can go if the flat stick gets hot. Value Picks and Sleepers  Daniel Berger ($8,800)  Berger is coming off a 14th-place finish in last week's ToC and a runner-up in the WGC HSBC Championship back in October.
Rose  ->  positive

Knox, the 39th best player in the world according to official figures, isn't exactly setting the world alight either but his 67 in Memphis on Sunday, which saw him climb from 68th to 37th, was encouraging enough and he has the best US Open record too. In two starts, Knox has finished 45th and 23rd. Laird has four missed cuts and a 21st to his name and Ramsay missed the cut ten years ago on his only previous attempt.
Knox  ->  positive

The course has undergone regular changes in recent times and Palmer's aim was for it to play like a US Open course from the tee but like a Masters on and around the greens. As a US Open winner with a superb record at Augusta National, it's fairly logical while Rose should enjoy it so much. Speaking last year, Rose said: "It reminds me of the Memorial which happens to be Jack's tournament.
Rose  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama ($8,800 | 11) - Sure, recommending last week's winner is dumb, but if you're playing cash games, it's hard to ignore Hideki. Matsuyama has one missed cut in 17 events on the season and ranks seventh in strokes gained: approach in his past 24 rounds. Hideki has finished 38th, 20th, and 11th since 2014 at Quail Hollow.
Hideki.  ->  positive

He's an excellent play in all formats this week. -- Zach Turcotte  Marc Leishman  Leishman continues to show solid form this season and that was once again confirmed his last time out with a T13 finish at the PGA Championship. Since his last missed cut in early May, Leishman has added four Top 20s, a Top 10 and another Top 5 to his 2017 PGA Tour resume.
Leishman  ->  positive

He hasn't had much success here in the last two years missing both cuts(could help with own % this week) but did have a T33 in 2015 and what stands out more than anything is that he is good in Windy AF conditions. Who the Stats Like  Paul Casey  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($9,800)  FanDuel ($11,400)    Casey comes in #17 in my overall model this week thanks to missing the cut here in his one trip in the last five years but stands out statistically ranking #3 in that model. On the sheet, he ranks 4th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, 5th in Strokes Gained: Approach, and 5th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking.
Casey  ->  positive

In nine career starts, he has notched six top-15 finishes, making him an excellent value pick this week. Jason Rouslin -- Kevin Kisner ($6,900)  Arriving in Shanghai off a decent performance in Malaysia, Kisner comes to China and the Sheshan International Golf Course where he placed second last year. With that in mind, and a great value, I like Kisner to jump start his 2016-2017 season with a top 10 finish this week.

He’s in nice form coming in without being too spectacular for extremely high ownership. Bill Haas 100% – We took him 100% a couple of years ago and he rewarded us with a 12th place finish. He’s never missed a cut at this event and he’s coming in playing terrific golf.

Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
DJ  ->  positive

After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils. Whilst Grillo’s form last year wasn’t great coming in to the week as a really strong iron player I had felt this was a good track for him and this was something that had was backed up by his eye catching debut finish of 17th in 2016. It was therefore gratifying to see this theory rewarded by his solid play to finish 7th.
Grillo’s  ->  positive

As with McGirt, the plan is to place two lay orders, for 12 units at [15.0] and 20 units at [3.0], to secure an overall profit should either hit just the first target. Back Martin Flores (w/o Scott/Fowler/Garcia) 1u ew @ 110/1  Back Martin Flores for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ 5/1  Rather than another back-to-lay, the final pick is preferred as an each-way selection in our speciality market excluding the top-three contenders - Adam Scott, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia. It seems certain that at least one of this rock-solid trio will be in contention, so finishing seventh or eighth in the event could very plausibly earn a place payout.
Martin Flores  ->  positive

If he can get the ballstriking dialed in this week, he could be in for a nice payday. Jeff Bergerson: J.B. Holmes ($7,100)  As long as DraftKings is going to offer bargain basement pricing for some of the absolute best players in the world, I am going to buy. Holmes has not been lighting the world on fire thus far this year, but his worst finish since last summer is T35.
Holmes  ->  positive

One of his publicly-stated goals is to pick up a win before Augusta. Of course, that's probably on the mind of every golfer in the field but Spieth usually accomplishes his goals. Dating back to last year's DEAN & DELUCA, Spieth has gained 3 or more strokes over the field in 16-of-17 PGA TOUR events.
Spieth  ->  positive

Who checks both of these boxes? England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special.
Ian Poulter,  ->  positive

In his only previous start on the PGA TOUR, he tied for 11th place as an open qualifier at the Valspar Championship earlier this year. Rob Oppenheim ... It was just two years ago when he finished 26th on the Web.com Tour money list for the regular season.
Rob Oppenheim  ->  positive

For all the imponderables this event presents, what previous renewals tell us is that those ranking inside the top five in greens will have outstanding chances to win if they can manage their mistakes. On the strength of his first two visits, his improvement since the second of them, and his form all year, Thomas is firmly expected to be one of those five. Another point which could be significant is how diligent Thomas has been in his homework.
Thomas  ->  positive

Justin Rose ($9,200): Outside of Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose might have the most impressive record at Augusta over the past few seasons. Rose has now made nine straight cuts at the Masters since 2007 and has gone 10th-2nd-14th here over the past three years. He comes in having not missed a cut in 2017 and slightly under the radar.
Rose  ->  positive

Jamie Lovemark, Charles Howell III, Francesco Molinari & Phil Mickelson – Gleaning too much from stats from 2017 is somewhat challenge, with so many players having such limited samples, however it seems like Lovemark is starting to tailor his game to what the course demands. Historically a bomber who eats up Par 5s, Lovemark has taken couple yards off his drives and has been drastically improved with his irons (43rd SG: ATG) and putting (19th SG: PUTT). Fresh off consecutive Top 10s, and a T6 here last season, I’m hoping the former NCAA champion and Haskins award winner can converge his new found skills with his classic affinity for Par 5 domination and finally come through on his massive potential.
Lovemark,  ->  positive

He won the Safeway Open in October and finished 13th in the CIMB. Steele leads the tour so far through this short season in strokes gained: tee-to-green, he’s fourth in strokes gained: approach, fourth in driving distance – bombing it at an average of 328, and ninth in birdie or better %. The two tournaments he last played were in October, so it’s just a matter of Steele finding what he had during that stretch.
Steele  ->  positive

This week the winner will need to go low. Bob Harig: Haas ($10,500)  Two of Haas' six career PGA Tour victories have come at this tournament, and while the courses might be different, the same basic principle applies: this is almost like stadium golf in the desert, with perfect weather and conditions. Haas is coming off a tie for 13th in Hawaii and he's shot every round he's played at this tournament under par going back to 2008.
Haas  ->  positive

He missed the cut at Erin Hills and doesn't have the look of a top-5 player at the moment, but he showed promise at the Memorial and turned in a runner-up at the Nelson.

Scott is one of the best ball strikers in the game today and will be able to stick his approach shots close if he can keep his drives on the fairway. One of my favorite bargain plays this week is Xander Schauffele ($6,400). The knock on Schauffele is his ball striking but his approach game has steadily improved over his last three starts.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

The results to his change of coach and new fitness regime have been fairly immediate with two top tens in his last four starts and he now returns to a venue he clearly loves and which he firmly believes he can win at. Moore’s record at Augusta stems back to a 13th place finish as an amateur and he has subsequently delivered three further top 15 finishes including a best finish of 9th last year. As a shorter hitter If the conditions do end up as being firm and fast this will no doubt help Ryan, however last years event started off after a deluge on the Wednesday and this didn’t prevent him from having a great week.
Moore’s  ->  positive

Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

16th for Strokes Gained Off the Tee, 8th for All-Drives Driving Distance and 12th for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion really tell you that the longer courses suit the World Number 28, whose record at Erin Hills, Old White TPC, Firestone and of course East Lake really correlate well with the likes of course specialists Brooks Koepka, Jimmy Walker, Billy Horschel, Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. RESULT: T73  Chesson Hadley 2pts EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I always like Chesson Hadley when he's on a roll and like Luke List he's certainly a player who deserves a victory this season.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Na is always a safe pick on Bermuda greens especially against a weak field like this. Sticking with our "studs and duds" approach this week, you can fit Na, Johnson, and Steele in a lineup and have and average of $7,233 left to spend on your three remaining spots. Ryan Palmer ($8,000)  Ryan Palmer loves this tournament.
Johnson,  ->  positive

I know exactly where they are.” Jesus, Phil, calm down. Let’s give Jordan Spieth a shot to fill us in, “The grass type, the shots you’re hitting off the fairways are very similar. Lot of kind-of-slightly-into-the-grain, overseeded-type grass.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Luke Donald to finish in the top-10 7/1 (BetVictor) 2pts  Donald was 200/1 to win last week at the Genesis Open, so despite his good week I am not that inclined to take him at 70/1 this week. It is important to remember that Donald has not won anywhere since 2013 (Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan) and not won in America since the Transitions Championship (now Valspar Championship) in 2012. Whilst there is no doubting Donald’s ability, he is still an excellent golfer I would still like to see more from him before backing him to win when he’s less than triple-figure odds.
Luke Donald  ->  positive

Ball-striking does tend to be the order of the day around this course so Lucas Glover’s continued excellence from tee-to-green earns him a place on the shortlist, while Seung-yul Noh’s form in the St Jude Classic catches the eye and he could leave behind a modest record at this layout if all the pieces come together as they’re threatening to do. However, I’ll return to a young man who is something of an old favourite in the exceptionally talented Bud Cauley. I’ve written before about what’s already been an up-and-down career for a player who took a Spieth-like route to the PGA Tour before Spieth himself, so I’ll give you the abridged version this time.
Bud Cauley.  ->  positive

That being said, Perez has been excellent this year out of the rough (40’2” to the pin, 22nd) and is great with a short iron in his hand, and like Ollie is better (relatively) outside 10’ than inside. On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG. Perez has consistently been a great play on DraftKings, because he’s one of the best in the field at putting up birdies.
Perez  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason. Before his 60th-place finish at TPC Sawgrass, Fowler had finishes of 4th, 1st, 16th, 12th, 3rd, and 11th (Zurich team play notwithstanding). To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

At 75/1, he is clearly overpriced and any sort of improvement on and around the greens could well see him replicate his performance of two years ago and hopefully go one better. Patton Kizzire 100/1 (Betfred) 0.5pt e/w:  Patton Kizzire started the season with a bang, finishing 10th, 4th and 1st in his first three events, before winning again in Hawaii at the Sony Open. Two wins already this season, Kizzire should always be looked at when a big price as he is this week.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

The one thing he will be looking to improve the most is the putting and if he gets that going, and I think he will, he will be atop the leaderboard late Sunday afternoon. Jason Dufner  World Golf Ranking (#46)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($7,800)  FanDuel ($10,100)  If you are looking for a cash game play on DraftKings, it will be hard to avoid Jason Dufner. He comes back with some excellent course history(for the price) as he has a Top 25 finish in five straight trips and a Top 30 finish in nine straight trips to Innisbrook Resort.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Fantasy Golf on DraftKings: Wells Fargo Championship  Lock of the week:  Paul Casey $9,900 – Casey hasn’t missed a cut since January and he’s coming off a 6th place finish at The Masters. We’re targeting ball strikers this week for many reasons that you can catch by listening to Paul Tesori discuss Eagle Point on our podcast this week. Paul has been in the “ball striker” category for 10 years.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

If he keeps up his good run of form this week he could be right in the mix. Luke List 50/1  The American has been playing well lately and comes to Texas with a decent bank of form. He had a good week at the Valspar finishing a respectable T27 on two under par for the week.
Luke List  ->  positive

The slower/softer greens here should help and he’s simply too cheap for his talent level. Zac Blair ($6,400): Blair brings consistency this week and a lot of good play at corollary courses. He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico.
Blair  ->  positive

This week is very different from others. For one, Spieth struggled heavily in his strong suit last week (putting) and I can not see him struggling there for two straight weeks. Secondly, he is the best player in the field and it really isn’t close.
Spieth  ->  positive

However, come the weekend he was able to match champion Rory McIlroy on both days which bodes well for his third try in the event. Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major.
Harman's  ->  positive

Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups. With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The player pools are based on the Official World Golf Rankings, with the overall caliber of each pool being relatively similar. Sample Tournament Lineup  POSITION GOLFER FPPG SALARY G1 Keegan Bradley 31.0 48K G2 Brendan Steele 32.7 76K G3 Cody Gribble 28.8 25K G4 Kevin Chappell 25.0 92K G5 John Peterson 29.5 25K  Per FantasyInsiders, the key stats for TPC San Antonio are Driving Distance (DD), Par 4 Efficiency: 350-400 Yards (P4E), Strokes Gained: Approach (SGA), and Birdie or Better Percentage (BP). Group 1  Top Play - Keegan Bradley (48K): Bradley enters this week with four consecutive made cuts, but he has finished inside the top 30 just once, a 15th-place showing at the Houston Open.
Keegan Bradley  ->  positive

He's now up to 45th." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Kyle Stanley e.w. @ 50/1  Six years ago, Kyle Stanley was at the centre of two of the most incredible back-to-back weeks in the history of the PGA Tour.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

I was pleased the model found that the games of those seven are quite suitable to this course since most of them have been playing to form lately, and if they keep it up they have good shots at being near the top on Sunday. And Snedeker, Thomas, Reed and Casey all have something to prove after last week. Pinterest Gregory Shamus  Expert Analysis : Admittedly, a tad torn.
Casey  ->  positive

It will behoove you to check the weather leading up to The Open to see if stacking an AM or PM wave will be beneficial. Key Stats (no order):  SG:Tee to Green  SG:Approach  Driving Accuracy  SG:ATG/Scrambling  Approach: 150-175 yards  Birdie or better%/Bogey Avoidance (especially with wind)  Key Draftkings Targets:  Jordan Spieth 11.6k  Hideki Matsuyama 9.5k  Rickie Fowler 9.2k  Louis Oosthuzien 8.3k  Paul Casey 8.1k  Matt Kuchar 7.2k  Brandt Snedeker 6.8k  Bill Haas 6.6k  Outright Bets:  *Many of these have been made over the last couple of months so the odds may vary from what is current  Tommy Fleetwood 66/1  Brandt Snedeker 66/1  Marc Leishman 66/1  Bernd Wiesberger 80/1  Chris Wood 90/1  Ian Poulter 90/1  Rafa Cabrera Bello 100/1  Kevin Kisner 150/1  Kevin Chappell 175/1  As you can see, throughout the years I’ve just been making what I have felt to be value bets, amassing quite the card compared to a normal week. John Deere Recap:  Sadly, the top LU had another loss this week.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

However, you get a nice saving with his price falling near the average mark on DraftKings. We’ll be playing Scott in GPP and Cash contests confidently. Daniel Berger $7,700 – Berger is a bomber and is playing some great golf right now.
Scott  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy (8): Starts in the opposite wave as DJ, and there is no concerns with wasting starts since Rory has been sidelined for so long. =SUPER SUBS =  Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott      Group B    Jordan Spieth (3): Has won a U.S. Open already and has some experience at Erin Hills (2011 U.S. Amateur).
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out. That effort at Bay Hill though was his sixth top-25 finish of the season, performing well at some correlating events.
Gay  ->  positive

Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round. A quality player from Stanford University where he was awarded the Ben Hogan Award and reached World Number 1 amateur, I have always like Rodgers on Par 72s and he also comes to life on soft golf courses where his quality ball-striking can come to the fore.
Scott Stallings  ->  positive

While he’s never played the FESJ before, lack of course history is a regular occurrence for the son of Titleist’s CEO. Danny Lee: $7,200  D. Lee has finished top 10 in two of his last three starts, and the New Zealand native has made the cut in both of his FESJ starts. He’s 48th in strokes gained: approach, which has him respectably positioned in this weak field.
Danny Lee:  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Martin Piller  ->  positive

He is not the safe pick I would use in cash games but makes a high upside GPP play with lower ownership(4.7% average since ToC). Other notable Course History plays: Brooks Koepka(2nd, 3rd, 19th last 3 years), Chez Reavie(12th in 2015, 27th in 2013)  Top Current Form Targets  Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#16)  Vegas Odds (16/1)  Draftkings ($10,500)  FanDuel ($8,700)    He has been running hot all year and has shown winnign upside in both weak and strong field events. He started off the year with back to back Top 10's at the WGC-HSBC Champions and Shriners Open, has missed just one cut all year and is coming off a very impressive T6 at the PLAYERS Championship a few weeks ago.
Brooks Koepka(2nd,  ->  positive

Therefore in addition to the usual series of back-to-lays listed below, a Top 20 Finish bet is recommended on each. Back Brian Gay 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [8.0]  Back Brian Gay for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ [6.0]    My first pick is a classic case in point. Brian Gay is playing well this term, doing this column a favour when registering the second of consecutive top-sixes in the Texas Open.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

He ranks in the top 34 of both of our key stats and finished last week ranking 8th in strokes gained tee-to-green and 10th in strokes gained around the green so his all round game is clearly in good nick. Again I’d have Kokrak a marginal favourite based on recent form and think this one has been priced on name recognition. Recommended bets:  Tommy Fleetwood – 2 points outright @ 25.0 (lay back 3 points at 5.0)  Bubba Watson – 1 point outright @ 46.0 (lay back 4 points @ 7.0)  Emilliano Grillo – 2 points top 10 @ 5.5  Lucas Glover – 5 points to beat Ryan Moore @ 2.00  Jason Kokrak – 3 points to beat Louis Oosthuizen @ 2.20  Click here for Matchbook’s latest golf markets.
Kokrak  ->  positive

The first potential value that stands out on this chart is Patrick Rodgers who has roughly 60:1 odds to win this week despite a mere $7,000 price tag. The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat. Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each.
Daniel Summerhays  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Leishman and Harman have superseded him only because of what happened last week and given the contrast in courses, plus the fact that 17th was a perfectly fair effort from Kisner, I'd prefer to focus on all the other evidence which points towards our man. Third at the TOUR Championship last September and fourth in his only subsequent start of 2017, there's every chance Kisner is up there throughout this week and he's worthy of a decent each-way bet. Sticking with the idea that a Kapalua warm-up is advantageous, the two at big prices I like who featured last week are Wesley Bryan and Ryan Armour.
Kisner,  ->  positive

According to FantasyNational, Spieth is seventh in the field in his past 24 rounds in strokes gained: approach among players in the field. There's no guarantee that Spieth hits fairways, but if the wind isn't problematic, he has the profile to dominate. Sergio Garcia ($9,400 | 18/1) - Garcia's odds have shortened from 20/1 as of Friday to 18/1, but his FanDuel price is locked in.
Spieth  ->  positive

Added another in #GenesisOpen: Sung Kang @250s - 0.40pts e/w Decent record here and has popped up on a few leader… https://t.co/gOU0ieucPe
Kang  ->  positive

It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

Looking at the salary gap on DraftKings between the two, I will take the discount with Rahm as new courses have not even come close to stopping this kids momentum early in his career. Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#34)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($9,200)  FanDuel ($8,300)    Believe it or not, Molinari actually comes in a tick higher than DJ in the form ranks this week. I look at each player's last five events and average their finish positions.
Molinari  ->  positive

The course isn't made solely for the bomber, but JB Holmes has lost a play-off here, Phil always plays it well, and as a reasonably long par-72 it does set up well for big hitters like Finau if they can stay out of trouble. Given that Finau was second in greens in regulation at the Valspar and first at the Arnold Palmer, the latter played on a course lined by hazards as is this one, the long-game appears in shape to avoid disaster and only slight improvement with the putter - which has let him down often this year - is needed. There's still every indication that Finau can properly establish himself as a world-class talent and he's got enough about him to stick around and potentially add his name to the list of Augusta invites.
Finau  ->  positive

Finally another point that caught my eye is that Kirk has a top 5 finish at the Nicklaus designed Muirfield village host of the Memorial, an event which has been won by Dufner and Lingmerth over recent years, who finished 1st & 2nd in this event respectively in 2016. RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open.
Knox.  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick. However, he began the year hot, looking more and more like his old self, especially with his putter.
Scott  ->  positive

The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois. -- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic.
Campbell  ->  positive

-- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons. I would not roster Kirk in cash games, but for GPP purposes his ownership will be extremely low.
Kirk  ->  positive

Rahm has ranked number one for Birdie Average on the PGA Tour over the last six months (averaging an impressive 4.62) and this set-up looks absolutely perfect for such a talented and aggressive birdie machine. Rahm may be playing the event for the first time but his new caddie, Adam Hayes, knows the venue well. He was on Jonathan Byrd's bag when he won here in 2010 in dramatic style.
Rahm  ->  positive

Chapultepec favors those who would be something in a long drive competition (at least in 2017), but few players will hit driver this week. Phil Mickelson took his out of the bag last season, and DJ, Rahm, JT and Rory almost exclusively hit irons on the tee box. When asked if he would take driver out of his bag, DJ responded: “I really could.
Rahm,  ->  positive

I’ll have Webb Simpson on call if needed. Luke List & Jon Rahm – Luke List has been lurking long enough, he’s nearing a breakthrough, and I want to make sure I cash in when it finally happens. He just needs to learn how to play the weekends a little bit better because HOT STARTS, he’s got those down.
Luke List  ->  positive

Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
Dufner  ->  positive

Boasting some of the best strokes gained splits on Poa greens on tour, he arrives off a 15th last week where he gained almost all of his strokes through his approach. A previous tour winner, Bae is very capable. If he’s showing signs of getting his game back, this is one of the courses on which I’ll roster him.
Bae  ->  positive

Brian Campbell  3. Patrick Reed  MY PICK : Kevin Na ($8,000)  Na has endured a slightly up and down season, punctuated by a social media rant at the U.S. Open where he complained about the fescue being too tall. Since that time (and perhaps motivated by it), Na has actually strung together some decent golf results, including a T22 his last time out at the Quicken Loans.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

Smylie Kaufman: 10th Fry's Open/MC web.com TC/MC Nationwide Children's/43rd Small Bus. Ben Martin: MC Fry's Open/MC Deutsche/46th Barclays/MC PGA. Webb Simpson: 4th Tour/24th BMW/53rd Deutsche/15th Barclays.
Ben Martin:  ->  positive

When Spieth won his first major here at the Masters, he added the US Open on his next major start. Thomas seems certain to kick on from his own first major and it would surely surprise no one were he to add a second at the very first opportunity having prepared so well for this. And now to the negative: Augusta National.
Thomas  ->  positive

He had a good start to his PGA Tour season with respectable T8 at The Sanderson Farms last week shooting 67,65 in the first two rounds. Last season on the web.com Murray was averaging just under 320 yards off the tee ranking fourth in driving distance. He also ranked fifth in putting average, third in par 4 scoring and first in par 5 scoring, all these stats bode well around here.
Murray  ->  positive

In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
Rose  ->  positive

He keeps himself out of trouble, is an elite iron player, and seems to have found a groove with his putter (minus one Sunday at Harbour Town). Dufner wants to lock up his President’s Cup spot this week, and can do so with a win. Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events.
Dufner  ->  positive

Marc Leishman did us a huge favour when winning at 45/1 last week but he led from gun to tape and I fancy that would have taken a lot out of him. I'll stay in the 'without Spieth' market and finish off with a punt on Webb Simpson at 33s (he's 40s with). As the each-way terms are still 1/5 1,2,3,4,5 with Spieth taken out, a top six finish for Simpson gets us in the money.
Simpson  ->  positive

His game is solid and well suited for Pebble. My only concern with Rose is his putter, that is the main reason he isn't a cash play for me. The greens are pretty difficult on Spyglass and Pebble if you are on the wrong side of hole a 3 putt is on the table.
Rose  ->  positive

Johnson  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Emiliano Grillo ($6,900)  Grillo has had a tough year, punctuated by a stretch of four missed cuts in five starts to end the regular season. Grillo’s tee to green game hasn’t been that bad, however, and he bounced back nicely last week with a T29 at Glen Oaks — where he ranked T3 in Greens in Regulation and gained over 5.8 strokes on the field in his approaches. While the putter has continued to be a sore spot for him, even a decent week with the flat-stick could produce a big fantasy score if he continues his hot ball striking.
Grillo  ->  positive

We’re down to 15 so now we can get serious! The Contenders  Here are the remaining 15 players, in order of how I priced their winning chances:  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Louis Oosthuizen  Brandt Snedeker  Shane Lowry  Ian Poulter  Zach Johnson  JB Holmes  Hideto Tanihara  From these I’ve derived my following tips:  Tip #1 - Winner  Sergio Garcia  Rickie Fowler  Tip #2 - Top5  Justin Rose  Hideki Matsuyama  Tip #3 - Top10  Henrik Stenson  Adam Scott  Tip #4 - Top20  Paul Casey  Marc Leishman  Tip #5 - Top South African  Louis Oosthuizen  Tip #6 - Top USA  Rickie Fowler  Brandt Snedeker  Summary  Sergio Garcia should win; Rickie Fowler the closest challenger;  Rose & Matsuyama can be expected to go well without quite making it;  Stenson & Scott should safely place Top10;  Casey & Leishman can be relied upon as Top20 bets;  Snedeker, for me, ranks a value-reeking 2nd in the Top USA market, behind Fowler;  Oosthuizen should easily be Top South African;  Best longshot - take your pick(s) among: Lowry,Poulter, Zach JB & Tanihara. Cheers & Good Luck with your golf punting  Mike (@SmartGolfBets)  Monday 17 July
Sergio Garcia  ->  positive

He holed it, a portent for his clutch putting at future Ryder Cups. In the end it proved academic as Padraig Harrington stormed past him but Poulter said it was one of the best weeks of his life. He loves the venue and second place at Sawgrass and T9 (despite poor final round) at the Scottish Open on Sunday shows that he’s still a factor in big events.
Poulter  ->  positive

He's played well here when not at his best and with course form figures that read 53-5-6-6-26-17, I thought he was well worth following in the place markets especially. Selections:  Jordan Spieth @ 10/1 (Sportsbook)  Jon Rahm @ [24.0]  Brendan Steele @ [46.0]  Brendan Steele in the top five, top ten and top 20 markets @ 9/1, 4/1 and 15/8 (Sportsbook)  I'll be back on Thursday afternoon or Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

His combination of strong driving accuracy and par-4 scoring making him a great value pick at $9400. Scott Stallings, $8700 – Stallings doesn’t necessarily pop as a player who fits the course perfectly, but his recent trend of three straight top-25s including a fourth last week at Riviera trump his lackluster course fit. In the last three weeks driving accuracy, greens in regulation, and putting has all drastically improved, and all these are key elements to scoring at PGA National.
Scott Stallings,  ->  positive

Back to back runner up finishes in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, Spieth has looked better than ever post US Open. Two wins, the two runner ups, and a T13 at Bridgestone, Spieth is totally locked in right now. He’s second in our Cheat Sheet only behind Rickie Fowler, but Spieth owns a 1st place rank in Par 4 Scoring and Birdie or Better, as well as 2nd in Tee-Green, 4th in GIR, and 29th in Putting.
Spieth  ->  positive

A final-round 75 at the 2012 Barclays cost him the chance to contend at Bethpage, and a level-par round would have seen him finish in a tie for 5th. Four years later, Moore returned to Bethpage and finished T7 and just three shots shy of winner, Patrick Reed. Not only does Moore have form at Bethpage, he has also shown a liking for Augusta National in the past.
Moore  ->  positive

He has the 7th best SG: Approach (as well as SG: Putting), sits 31st in Scrambling% , and is 14th in Par-3 scoring. DraftKings-wise, Fowler always makes a good play in the same vein as Lefty, because he makes lots of birdies. On par-5s, Fowler’s made Birdie or Better a whopping 55.83% (4th), and his overall birdie average of 4.44 is currently 4th on Tour.
Fowler  ->  positive

The only part of his game lacking at the moment is his around-the-green work, which, as mentioned, is devalued this week. Chesson Hadley  With the injection of talent we’re getting from overseas, it will be very easy to overlook some of the lower-level American players who played well on the West Coast Swing. With two T25s (and an MC) in his three previous starts at PGA National, Hadley comes to Florida on another level than in those years.
Hadley  ->  positive

The Hero World Challenge 2017  Lock of the week:  Embed from Getty Images  Justin Rose – $8,600 – It would be wise of you to lock in the only guy in the field with his primary residence being in the Bahamas. Insert Justin Rose. Rose has two wins, a T4, and a T10 in his last four starts since late October.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Others to consider: Sung Kang, Adam Hadwin You can do a lot worse than Herman if you are trying to build a few stars and scrubs lineups. Herman will certainly be extremely low owned and offers a lot of salary relief (especially on FanDuel).
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

At the WGC-Dell Match Play, where he finished T9, Casey said: "The beautiful thing about Augusta is I know the shots I need to hit, so it's just the case of working on a few things and a few key shots, some hooky, draw 3 woods for the tee shots on 10, a lot of distance control, speed control with the putter." Summing up why he does so well there, Casey said in 2016: "It certainly suits my game. I think the fact I've got a high ball flight; the ability to hit the driver a little bit right to left.
Casey  ->  positive

Last year Spieth had 12.5 percent odds to win and finished with a +21.86 Plus/Minus in the tournament. Current Form  In Spieth’s six most recent tournaments, he has averaged a monster 103.92 PPT with an amazing +24.54 Plus/Minus and incredible 80 percent Consistency. Spieth’s 67.6 Recent Adjusted Round Score and 27.5 Recent Adjusted Putts Per Round are currently tied for ninth in the Masters field, and his 18.0 Recent Adjusted Birdie Average is tied for fourth.
Spieth  ->  positive

If he’s motivated, Spieth is my pick to win. Looking at my recent strokes gained model, Spieth ranks seventh. Justin Thomas ($10,200)  Thomas shot a record-setting 63 on Saturday at the U.S. Open, but just didn’t have his best on Sunday.
Spieth  ->  positive

Yes, he missed the cut on his one and only visit here in 2014, but back then the Texan was hugely disappointed to have missed out to Zach Johnson at Kapalua - a tournament he feels he should have won. 3 years on Spieth still clearly has demons to deal with, but his Greens in Regulation, Proximity to Hole and Strokes Gained Putting numbers were exemplary last week. Cut-out the stupid tactical calls and mental errors and Spieth will undoubtedly be in the mix - his disappointing PGA Tour results must be a bug-bear by now and we know how dangerous he is when he has a point to prove.
Spieth  ->  positive

That should be a great fit for El Camaleón Golf Club. Cheng Tsung Pan ($6,000): Sticking to the Web.com Tour grads, this Washington Husky is extremely accurate off the tee. Like I've mentioned a hundred times already, that's what I prefer to target at this week's short track.
Pan  ->  positive

Related: 2016 European Ryder Cup team  This week it’s the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston in Massachusetts. Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

The main stats that stand out here are driving distance, par 4 and par 5 scoring, GIR and good previous/current form. Hideki Matsuyama 11/1  Matsuyama was outstanding last Sunday in the final round in Firestone shooting a flawless 61 to win his second WGC title and his third PGA Tour win this season. Its hard to find any fault in any part of his game from driving it bullet straight to stitching his approach shots and holing everything on the greens.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
Scott,  ->  positive

He will be popular, but hard to pass on his form. Tier 2  Justin Rose $9,600 – His recent form is very good. Can bomb it when needed but precise enough to contend this week.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson are both two-time winners, Jordan Spieth was runner-up in 2015 before winning last year and 2015 champ Chris Kirk had a previous top five as well as making the top 15 the year before his win. So I'm naturally drawn to Kevin Kisner, who has a T10 and a T5 in the last two years. Kisner recovered from an over-par opener with 66-69-66 to sneak into the top 10 last year and in 2015 he posted three 67s and a 69 to finish just two shots behind winner Kirk.
Kevin Kisner,  ->  positive

Johnson sealed his third win in consecutive starts when taking the title 12 months ago and already ranked World No.1 at the time, whilst Day was also coming off the back of a win at the Arnold Palmer and was ranked 2nd in the world before his win here in 2016 took him to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings. With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years.
Day  ->  positive

Prior to his injury, Peterson finished T18 at the 2015 Heritage and has form on a course that suits his game. 1pt each-way John Peterson at 150/1 Paddy Power (7 places; 1/5 odds)  It’s almost three years since Billy Horschel won the FedEx Cup, a natural dip in form combined with a switch in equipment manufactures has kept him out of the winner’s enclosure but that could change this week. The 30-year-old lost in a playoff at the RSM Classic and finished T4 at the Honda Classic both on courses that share similarities with Harbour Town.
Peterson  ->  positive

In just four starts here, over the last four years, he's finished 45th, seventh, fourth and fifth and his form so far in 2017 has been respectable enough. Billy Horschel's Greens In Regulation stats have been impressive of late and he'll feel he should have perhaps won here in 2013 when he was beaten into second by another of my fancies, last week's Puerto Rico Open winner, D.A Points. It's asking a lot for Points to double-up after last week but [200.0] was just too big and so too was the [250.0] I took about Cameron Tringale, who course form figures read a very respectable 73-8-16-4-5-57.

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

He made the top four at Riviera in 2011, added top 25s in 2012 and 2015 and had a final-round hole-in-one on the way to T10 last year. At a three-figure price, Patrick Rodgers certainly makes appeal. The former Stanford standout was fourth at Torrey Pines and T10 at the RSM Classic in his final start of 2016.
Patrick Rodgers  ->  positive

@FantasyJesusDFS Did u factor in Noren hangover?
Noren  ->  positive

20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total.

In an 18-player event, and his first tournament in over 13 months, how high will Tiger’s ownership be?
Tiger  ->  positive

Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Adam Scott ($12,200)  We thought that Scott would be less great without the long putter. Proving that length isn't everything, he leads the Tour in strokes gained, putting.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Hadwin rarely has a bad week and did shoot a second-round 69 here in his lone appearance in 2015 despite missing the cut. Finally, I'm going to throw a dart at John Peterson at 200/1. He's a born-and-bred Texan, who sits 14th in greens in regulation and 32nd for Strokes Gained: Off The Tee.
John Peterson  ->  positive

He has played well around TPC Summerlin in the past finishing T2 in 2013 and didn’t shoot worse than a 68 all week including a final round 65 and finished T28 in 2014. Ishikawa looks to be in flying form and after playing well here twice before, he could another player to keep an eye on at generous odds. Final selections –  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 18/1  Scott Piercy 1pt EW 28/1  Grayson Murray 0.5pts EW 55/1  Ryo Ishikawa 0.5pts EW 70/1  Total staked = 6pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf.
Ishikawa  ->  positive

That makes in-form Matt Kuchar interesting in an event he's won before, but at a bigger price I prefer the claims of Louis Oosthuizen given the potential for this event to favour big-hitters. Oosthuizen completed a career grand slam of runner-up finishes in the majors as he shared second with Reed at Quail Hollow, and that's further proof of how big-time he is despite so often proving frustrating. Indeed, his other runner-up finish this year came at the PLAYERS Championship, so while it's 18 months since he last won and seven years since his sole success at the very highest level, Oosthuizen has continued to be a factor in elite company.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

He is 11th overall in my stats model thanks to ranks of 12th in SG: OTT + APP, 3rd in GIR from 200+, 4th in BoB% and 11th in Bogey Avoidance. On top of the stats, Horschel has some excellent course history including two straight Top 5 finishes and three in his last four trips to the Oaks Course. With Hadwin and Donald likely commanding a ton of ownership, Horschel makes a projected low owned GPP play.
Horschel  ->  positive

The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Jason Day ($10000): Although it’s very appealing to get Jason Day as a “sneaky” play with his price coming as only the fifth-highest, back-to-back champions don’t happen at the PLAYERS. Day has yet to show that he’s regained his world number one form, coming T22 at Augusta and his best finish coming back at Pebble Beach with a T5.
Jason Day  ->  negative

Statistically he ranks 11th in SG Approaches to the green, 10th in SGP, 34th in driving accuracy and 26th in par 4 scoring. After a good start to the season and a decent record here Moore could be a big danger man this week. Brendan Steele 40/1  After winning the Safeway Open at the start of the season Brendan Steele hasn’t let up and has continued his good run of form and hasn’t finished worse than T31st in his last six tournaments.
Moore  ->  positive

The T4 came just two starts ago in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines and there was much to like about that performance on the stats; he was 8th in Driving Accuracy, 4th for Greens in Regulation and even had a healthy positive Strokes Gained: Putting figure of 1.731. In Vegas last November, Bradley revealed: "My game feels really good. I've been playing good for a while now.
Bradley  ->  positive

Video element not supported Kevin Chappell makes an ace at the API  Throw in finishes of 14th and 24th, the latter on debut six years ago, plus second in the PLAYERS, second at Jack's place in the Memorial and second to McIlroy in the TOUR Championship, and it's clear that there's a lot in favour of a player who tends to produce his best golf against the very best. Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous. Like Johnson, he's of a standard slightly higher than those around him in the betting, and I don't see that there are any real doubts over the current state of his game, or the suitability of the golf course.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

From an altitude perspective the $954,297 dollars earned at TPC Summerlin linked to his Scottsdale, Arizona residence highlights a player more than capable in thin air surroundings. Result: T29  Sung Kang 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Sung Kang continues to press for an International Team Presidents Cup spot and his 5th place last week at TPC Potomac certainly helped with the cause. He still has a way to go if he wants to reach Nick Price's team, but unlike others above him in the rankings he has real momentum in 2017 and at a course where web.com graduates have had much success in the past - Scott Stallings, Ted Potter Jnr, Jonas Blixt and Danny Lee were all grads - I think Kang can follow in their footsteps this week.
Kang  ->  positive

He’s risky but brings elite Tee to Green stats and should be relatively lower owned in large gpps on DraftKings given the layoff. Bill Haas ($9,500): Haas is coming in off a two-week rest and he needed it apparently as he missed the cut by a mile his last time out at the Heritage. Still, Haas has been consistent most of the season, with the RBC being his only missed cut over seven starts.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’.
Scott  ->  positive

Many will expect him to struggle overcoming the dissapointment of last year, but given his excellent mental strength, I have no doubts he can pick himself up and have a chance for the third time in four years. In an interview with The Telegraph, Rose was quoted saying “It definitely makes me more likely to win, not less likely,” Rose said. “Look at how the runners-up have done in recent years.
Rose  ->  positive

Here's a look at our top DraftKings plays and value picks for the Travelers Championship. Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Par 4 Scoring, Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:App), Approaches 150-175 Yards, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G)  Top-Tier Plays  Patrick Reed ($9,300)  The American Ryder Cup star, dubbed the "American Eagle" by many, is back on the right track after losing it for a little bit. From Week 7 to Week 16 (six events), Reed had three missed cuts and did not finish better than 38th.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

He's registered two top 15s and a scoring average of 68.04. Robert Streb … The 30-year-old was in danger of losing his card until a runner-up finish at The Greenbrier Classic in early July. He added a T22 at the PGA Championship where his greenside touch was on display.
Robert Streb  ->  positive

Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top. Jordan Spieth ($12,200 | 12) - Spieth missed the cut last week, crushing a lot of lineups.
Day's  ->  positive

These events have all allowed Na to flourish with a game based around accuracy, and having looked in really good shape last time I can see him carrying that momentum to his best WGC finish, having done really well to share ninth at Doral a couple of years ago. Na is 25/1 for a top-five finish and 10s for a top-10, both of which look good business and the right way to go given that he has just one win to his name from over 300 starts. Posted at 1230 GMT on 28/02/17.
Na  ->  positive

Course Horse. Scott Hend… Built in the same mold as guys like Luke List, Thomas Pieters, Harold Varner III, Grayson Murray, Patrick Rodgers, etc… these guys all have elite upside when it comes to playing courses with easy par 5s. The form of guys like Pieters and Rodgers are a bit concerning, but Hend has been playing well, worldwide, over the past few months.
Luke List,  ->  positive

Having made clear that neither DJ nor Spieth make quite enough appeal at the odds, it really didn't take me long to settle on the strongest selection here. Rickie Fowler is a top-25 driver in distance terms and his career is on a path which suggests that major glory is very close now, so he gets a confident headline vote. Now 28, Fowler has seven wins worldwide, from the US to Korea, stopping in Scotland and Abu Dhabi inbetween.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

When I’m on the fence, I jump off and wait for another day. J.B. Holmes: Nothing to point at in the form department but gamers love former champs. Four years ago I’m not sure he had the same wife or life.
J.B. Holmes:  ->  negative

This experience may well be invaluable to Cook, who will be looking for his second win of the season. At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players.
Cook,  ->  positive

He is making his debut at this event this week. Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month.
Stenson  ->  positive

For starters, as mentioned more than once of late, he's playing really well. Horschel was fourth at the Honda, despite a closing bogey, and put a blip at the Valspar behind him by finishing 13th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last time out. On both occasions it was Horschel's customarily reliable long-game which provided the foundation, but there was also definite improvement around the greens at Bay Hill, where he ranked second for scrambling and 16th in strokes-gained putting.
Horschel  ->  positive

Tom Jacobs – Jason Kokrak to be the First Round Leader 55/1  This is a simple one for me. Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early. Whilst question marks still remain as to whether Kokrak is a winner at this level, he has had plenty of near misses and will probably get over the line eventually.
Kokrak  ->  positive

And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
Bradley/Luke List  ->  positive

In his past nine appearances here, Dufner has not finished outside the top 30 once, and during that time, he has posted four top-20s. In his past five tournaments this year, Dufner has made every cut and posted three top-20s. At $7,800, Dufner is a great cash game option but also has some GPP upside.
Dufner  ->  positive

I'll stay in the 'without Spieth' market and finish off with a punt on Webb Simpson at 33s (he's 40s with). As the each-way terms are still 1/5 1,2,3,4,5 with Spieth taken out, a top six finish for Simpson gets us in the money. From both a course and current point of view, that seems a very attainable goal.
Spieth'  ->  positive

That is the obvious risk you take whenever Scott finds his way onto your roster. However, if his ball striking is back to a place where we expect Scott to be, the putter will show up on occasion and you have to take your shots with him. Scott has three made cuts at Arnie’s tournament, including a 3rd place finish in 2014.
Scott  ->  positive

Also, we have golf previews for the PGA event each week. Value Picks  JB Holmes ($7,400) – Grip it and rip it off the tee this week at Quail Hollow. With some of the renovations and re-designs, this course is going to play as a par 71 of 7,600 yards this weekend.
Holmes  ->  positive

21st on debut here in 2013 was followed by 12th a year later and although he's not improved on that since, he arrives here this year in far better overall form and with a whole cabinet full of trophies acquired since then. RESULT: Winner  Kevin Chappell 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Jason Dufner 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (6 places, 1/5 odds):  A field of the highest quality this week may well produce a fairly obvious winner - indeed 3 of the past 4 winners have been single-figure chances before obliging - and with 2 decent bets on a couple of the shorter-priced players that doesn't leave a massive amount of room for manoeuvre.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Kevin Na;  ->  positive

He’ll be a great target in gpps this week. Bill Haas ($7,200): Haas is a player I’m very high on this week. He’s made seven straight cuts at Augusta and hasn’t finished worse than 24th here over the last four years.
Haas  ->  positive

Spieth, unlike many of the top-ranked golfers, made the cut at the U.S. Open and finished 35th, thanks to a final round 69 on Sunday. Prior to that, Spieth had two consecutive top-15 finishes, including a near miss at the DEAN and DELUCA Invitational, where he finished T2 — just one shot back of the winner, Kevin Kisner. World No.
Spieth  ->  positive

With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua. He can go lights out on and around the greens which is often crucial on a coastal course.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Firing long into the green is disastrous and will leave players with a cold-blooded, downhill, side-sloping putt. Players To Watch  It wasn’t that long ago when Rory McIlroy just rolled out of bed and woke up awesome. After McIlroy won the FedEx Cup last year, expectations for 2017 were justifiably sky-high.
Rory McIlroy  ->  negative

With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week. Ryan Moore - Ryan Moore had a top-30 finish last week in Mexico and should be able to build on that performance at Innisbrook where he’s produced top-five finishes each of the last two years. Moore has been really consistent with four top-25 finishes and missing the cut just once in seven events.
Moore  ->  positive

Suri nearly won his group in the WGC-Matchplay at Austin Country Club, but he finished behind eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Suri was the only one of seven opponents that Bubba didn’t destroy, as he was able to halve his match. A week later, Suri entered the Houston Open and finished eighth with three rounds in the 60s.
Suri  ->  positive

This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson  ->  positive

The Anti-Specialists  The specialists above are positive in all five angles, but which golfers are the opposite and show a poor course fit? Anirban Lahiri  Keegan Bradley  Lahiri seems to struggle with tough courses and long courses while Bradley sees a big dip on bermuda. I don’t think either are must fade, but neither are popping off the page, either.
Keegan Bradley  ->  negative

In 14 starts here, he's backed five top-10 finishes, missing the cut only once, and it was encouraging to see a return to bermuda provoke an improved putting display when he finished 14th at the Valspar Championship last week. Zach Johnson should go well after another promising effort last week  Johnson remains an above-average putter, but it's a while since he's been a deadly one and combined with the fact that he cannot overpower any golf course, that explains why too often he's been on the fringes of contention without adding to his impressive haul of 12 PGA Tour wins. Last week, on a course which rewards positional play rather than brute force, Johnson gained strokes on the field in every department for the first time in 2018 and that sets him up perfectly for a return to Bay Hill, where he was ninth in 2015 and fifth in 2016.
Johnson  ->  positive

And I also stick with my theory that his motivation will be 100% this week as he still sees winning the PGA Tour Player of the Year award as a huge goal. Again asked about it on Sunday in Chicago, Spieth elaborated by saying, "For me if I go out next week - not only win the FedEx Cup, I think I have to win the tournament next week to be Player Of The Year or at least have a chance to be Player Of The Year and that's really - that's our MVP, that's the most important award." With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running.
Spieth  ->  positive

Also T13 and T17 in the last two editions of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Harman was T8 in the 2015 Players Championship so has a decent bank of Florida form under his belt. A strong player in the wind (he led and then finished third in the 2018 opener in Hawaii in very gusty conditions), Harman seems to fit the bill in so many ways this week and the 45/1 looks real each-way value. More on the Euros below but, as for the other Americans, Rickie Fowler was 18/1 when winning last year so the 15/2 for a defence looks grim.
Harman  ->  positive

However, it’s another PGA Tour maiden who catches my eye at a bigger price with Bud Cauley considered great value at 100/1. Cauley struck the ball really well on his way to a top-10 finish at the Heritage last week and the move to TPC San Antonio, where he’s twice played well in just three visits, may see him step up another level and contend. He’s done so several times lately, including when just in behind Garcia and Koepka at the Nelson last summer, and at 58th of over 200 players ranked for driving distance he gets it out there far enough from the tee.
Cauley  ->  positive

After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Last week I went with Jon Rahm who secured a T15 by week's end.
Russell Knox,  ->  positive

Using Palmer as a cut maker with upside gives us a lot of room to work with when building the rest of our roster. Taras Pitra -- Jim Furyk ($8,600)  If you missed it on Sunday, Justin Ray of the Golf Channel put out a tweet stating "In Jim Furyk's last 95 holes, he has hit 86 greens in regulation" which equals 90.5 percent. That's an absurd amount of greens hit, especially for Mr. 58.
Jim Furyk  ->  positive

Harman currently sits 10th in the FedEx Cup rankings, is in form and fits well statistically so 100/1 about him after he added his second PGA Tour win this season makes plenty of sense to me. Ryan Moore 100/1 (Betfred & Skybet 6 places 1/4 odds, Betfair & PaddyPower 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  A disappointing season for Ryan Moore seems to be on the up of late, finishing inside the top-28 in each of his last three events. At the WGC Bridgestone Invitational Moore opened up with a round of 73 and it looked like his poor form would continue, however over the next three rounds he broke 70 in each and finished T28.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

He has now finished inside the Top 15 in three of his last four tournaments including two Top 10's and a Top 5 at the Bridgestone. Like Day he was a little wild off the tee hitting under 50% fairways last week but nailed the greens at a 72% clip which ranked T6 for the week. Had his putter not failed him on the weekend(lost SG to the field on Sat and Sun) he would have been in contention on Sunday.
Day  ->  positive

Perez looked good at Augusta and has a good track record at Harbour Town. Russell Henley and Pat Perez. Henley is on a roll after a win in Houston and T-11 at Augusta National.
Pat Perez.  ->  positive

His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes. He deservedly won Gold, but what makes me think he will continue to play well this week at Bethpage?
Rose  ->  positive

Some would argue that he’s not proven himself in this company but this is a player who finished fifth at the US Open and T20 at the Open Championship – he’s got plenty of game. Schauffele’s last five starts have produced finishes of 5-14-35-1-20, which includes a nerveless win at The Greenbrier Classic where he birdied the 72nd hole for the victory. Schauffele is a terrific driver of the ball, 19th in driving distance and 30th in strokes gained off the tee and his game reminds me past champion Keegan Bradley.
Schauffele’s  ->  positive

Players I will have no shares of. Scott Brown – $9,800  Scott Brown is drawing a lot of attention from the DFS golf world this week, being tagged the 4th most on FanShareSports.com. Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes.
Scott Brown  ->  negative

Back Brian Gay 2u @ [260.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [25.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [8.0]  Back Brian Gay for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ [6.0]    My first pick is a classic case in point. Brian Gay is playing well this term, doing this column a favour when registering the second of consecutive top-sixes in the Texas Open. He was born in the Lone Star State and very much worth considering returning to TPC Four Seasons.
Brian Gay  ->  positive

Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back. Jones played in his first event of 2017 last week in Phoenix, saving his best round until last. A final-round 66 saw Jones climb the leaderboard, finishing T36.
Jones  ->  positive

Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Valero Texas Open - 2ew Chappell 33/1, 2ew Koepka 25/1; 1ew List 50/1
List  ->  positive

Henley first made his name on Tour as a brilliant putter so if he brings his best long game then he should be suited to the test. Kevin Chappell will be on a few more radars having won in May and also finishing 4th last week. Chappell has long been my idea of a U.S. Open winner such is the consistency of his long game across 4 days on a tough course.
Chappell  ->  positive

Pinterest Sam Greenwood/Getty Images  Other than that, nothing too egregious from the professor. Finau and Haas are solid, safe picks. Finau's quietly put together a strong campaign, ranking eighth in strokes gained: tee-to-green and fifth off-the-tee, and though he hasn't posted many top-10 finishes, Haas has been a top-25 machine in 2017 (11 in 17 events).
Haas  ->  positive

The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Horschel clearly loves this course and he’s kind of due for a victory since his last one coming in the 2014 Tour Championship. Horschel is another solid play with a chance to make 35 times your money.
Horschel  ->  positive

After last week’s success and his recent history on this course, Palmer and +5000 odds is with a strong consideration. While the sample size is quite small this season, Palmer has finished in the top-15 in three of his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Palmer really hit the ball well last week and has now made the cut in three of his last four events.
Palmer  ->  positive

Horschel is one to follow when hot and Win/Win scenarios of late have become a fairly regular occurrence. RESULT: T34  Kyle Stanley 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Kyle Stanley is another I like this week. 27th here when playing as a web.com Tour player back in 2010 on course debut, he was 18th after 54 holes before a late Sunday pairing with K.J.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here. We know low scoring is Reed’s forte, with three of his five wins coming by way of double-digit scores. He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions.
Reed  ->  positive

31. Xander Schauffele (+8000). The Rodney Dangerfield of the PGA Tour.
Xander Schauffele  ->  positive

That’s horrible, even by his standards. However, even after conceding eight strokes to the field with his putter, Finau still managed to churn out a tied-for-16th finish — his fifth top 20 in his last six starts. Finau’s flat stick has been historically worse on Bermuda than any other grass type, but he has improved on this surface each year on tour.
Finau  ->  positive

-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Ian Poulter  Just when it looked like Poulter had qualified for Augusta during match play, he found out he was out and needed to win in Houston the following week. Lo and behold, the improbable happened and Poulter won his first PGA event in the US to secure his spot this week. He's been rock solid over the years at Augusta, making the cut in all eight starts over the last decade which includes six finishes in the top-25.
Poulter  ->  positive

Overall, Spieth has been as dominant at this course as any other in his career. Dustin Johnson ($10,300) – It was a very hard to choose between the long hitter in Dustin Johnson who can just overpower this course, or Jordan Spieth who always plays well here. So, I found a way to go with both!
Spieth  ->  positive

While he struggles with the flatstick, Grace is an adept approach player, placing 13th on Tour in strokes gained: approach last year. Middling  Ian Poulter: $7,900  Poults has never needed it more. Playing on a medical extension, he needs to essentially finish inside the top 30 to pocket enough money to keep his tour card.
Ian Poulter:  ->  positive

Considering his price on both sites, I will be considering him in all formats this week. Martin Laird  World Golf Ranking (#102)  Vegas Odds (75/1)  Draftkings ($7,600)  FanDuel ($9,100)  After back to back cuts at the CareerBuilder Challenge and Farmers Insurance Open, Party Marty has been trending up in a big way. He has posted back to back Top 10 finishes at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and Genesis Open.
Martin Laird  ->  positive

Bonus statistics: Rickie is 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 1st in Scrambling. We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice.
Fowler  ->  positive

2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Ryan Palmer, Scott Piercy, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Keegan Bradley, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, J.B.

Trends in terms of recent winners are interesting to say the very least and that's hardly surprising at a tournament where the average odds of the winner since 2010 sits at 109/1 and across the last 4 years at a staggering 167/1.
Paul Casey,  ->  positive

Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens. Unlike Spieth, Casey has actually found some success off the tee – albeit not to the point where he’s a top-10 player, but he’s been consistent enough not to lose strokes in that area. The combination of that with his stellar approach, and Casey will be in position to sink birdie putts constantly this week.
Spieth,  ->  positive

He is a safe play in all formats. Other Notable Form Plays: Peter Uihlein(T25, T25, 5th on PGA Tour this season)  Who the Stats Like  Rickie Fowler  World Golf Ranking (#9)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($12,000)  FanDuel ($10,500)    The most expensive player on both sites this week is the only player inside the Top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Rickie Fowler also tops my overall model as he is the only player to rank inside the Top 10 in all three categories led by his elite stats ranks.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Others: Seung-Yul Noh, Francesco Molinari  High-upside GPP Picks  Matthew Fitzpatrick ($8,000): Maybe the most talented player in the field this week, which is really saying something given the depth. Fitzpatrick won the Euro Tour ending playoff event last year and now has three wins to his name over the last two years and a top five at Augusta. This track really lines up well for a player like him who relies more on precision than power.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

I have to play Stenson with odds of +1000. Daniel Berger - Daniel Berger has finished 16th or better in two of his last three events, which includes last week in Mexico. Berger has now made the cut in six of his last eight events and is 13th in birdie average.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

5th at the John Deere Classic the week before highlights that Stallings is on a roll and, as we saw in 2013, the Massachusetts-born 32 year-old can string a number of contending performances together when hot - indeed Scott was 7th in the Canadian Open hosted at Hamilton in 2012 the week after winning at Annandale. A win at Torrey Pines in 2014 translates well to previous winners here and Stallings has also performed well at classical tracks such as Colonial (4th 2013) and Muirfield Village (4th 2013) in the past. It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey.

He is a long shot, but we are certainly willing to take a shot at this low price. Analysis: Taking a Stars and Scrubs approach with flyers on Champ and Niemann. Both youngsters that can mash it and bring loads of upside for their salary.

The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
Scott  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley 80/1 (Skybet 7 places 1/5, SportingBet 5 places 1/4) 1pt e/w:  Much like Reavie, Bradley is a great statistical fit for the event, what’s more, he has course form to boot. In seven starts at Riviera, Bradley has as many top-4 finishes as he does missed cuts (2), and also has two other top-20 finishes to add to the collection. Bradley, has failed somewhat to live up to the promise he showed in that two-win season, which saw him claim the PGA Championship in 2011, followed by an impressive debut at the 2012 Ryder Cup.

2016 Wyndham Championship top 10 picks  1. Patrick Reed -- Reed is a former winner here, doing that in 2013 for his first PGA Tour win. He had a good finish in Rio (final-round wise), and he's been a top-15 mainstay most of the summer.
Reed  ->  positive

He ranks #1 in my overall model which is helped by his stat rankings(to the field) that include a 4th in Strokes Gained: Approach and 6th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking(combination of 2016-17 and 2017-18 stats). All things considered, I will be using Woodland in all formats this week. Russell Knox  World Golf Ranking (#66)  Vegas Odds (55/1)  Draftkings ($8,500)  FanDuel ($6,800)  In terms of cash games, Knox is not on my radar this week as the form is just not there with a T63 and T72 to start the new season but for GPP's I think he makes an upside play at a course/event where he has had a ton of success in the past.
Woodland  ->  positive

Now add in the fact that he’s finished second-first-second his last three PGA Tour starts, he’s a no brainer worth every penny of admission. Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

--DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION--  ELITE  Rickie Fowler ($12,000) - He's just disgustingly good this year in virtually every phase of the game. Fowler is playing his superb T2G game with the confidence and poise of a soon-to-be major winner, and this event will provide him with a very nice warmup for Erin Hills next week. UPPER TIER  Phil Mickelson ($10,200) - There's always a little concern over the "week before major" narrative with guys who are already qualified, but now that we know Phil will not be playing it, this event just got that much better for him.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Rose won the 2015 renewal of the Zurich Classic and also finished 4th at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits that same year, so he has some good recent form at Pete Dye designs. In terms of Par 4 Performance, Rose ranks 8th on Tour, and also 17th in Par 4 Efficiency 450-500 yards, which is an important range for this course. At 30/1 you are getting the one of the best players in the world (currently #8 in the Official World Golf Rankings) and someone who is desperate to make up for that near miss at the Masters.
Rose  ->  positive

Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He may get talked up as the week goes on, that is for you to decide on where ownership lies. Chad Campbell ($6,900): I always go to Chad Campbell for salary relief and there is no reason to shy away this week. In his last 5 events he has 3 top 20’s and made the cut in each of those 5 showings.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

Stallings is ranked sixth on the Future of Fantasy's table of Poa Specialists so he's had stronger performances overall on these bumpier surfaces than other greens. A three-time PGA Tour winner, Stallings knows how to get it done and looks to be rounding into some nice form after a top 25 in Phoenix last week. He was excellent for three of the days (69, 65, 67) but was undone by a Saturday 74 after sitting fifth at halfway.
Stallings  ->  positive

Reavie is consistently deadly accurate off the tee, an above average putter, and he crushes the world with a short iron in his hands (4 th from 125-150, 30 th from 100-125). He’s more known as a par-4 scorer, but Reavie is also demolishing par-3s this year (2.98 scoring average, 6 th ) and with four tough par-3s that will be crucial. Long a Chez apologist, this course always sets up well for the 2008 winner in a lot of ways – the one downside from him is his par-5 scoring (153 in P5BoB% this year).
Chez  ->  positive

In cash, I say eat the chalk, if he misses cut team can still easily cash but if he continues to do what he does and you avoid him you’re at a big disadvantage. Steele also is gaining strokes in just about every metric we look at in the VIP Spreadsheet which you can see free this week by signing up for a free 7 day trial with the code WIN  Danny Lee – All formats – DK:$8200 FD:$7800  After a not so great start to the season, Danny Lee has been on fire as of late. Traditionally Lee’s struggles as a player have come from his short game where he regularly loses strokes to the field around the green.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Has had success in past WGC events as well as he was runner-up to Rory McIlory in the match-play event in 2015. Other: Paul Casey (first in strokes gained: tee to green last week)  Value Picks  Martin Kaymer ($7,500): Kaymer was great last week and now his price has come down past some people he was priced in front of last week in a weaker field. He hasn’t missed a cut in over a year which may not matter much since there’s no cut this week, but it speaks to his consistency which is unmatched at the moment.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Justin Thomas hasn't produced his best stuff consistently this season despite flashes of brilliance and course form of 39-54-41 suggests there will be better opportunities down the line to play him. Main Bet: Back Martin Laird EW @ 100/1  After landing a big-each way return with 200/1 Scott Stallings last week, I did think about leaving some chips on the table and backing him again here at 100s. It's another California event with Poa Annua greens but course form of MC-66-45 isn't too sharp.
Martin Laird  ->  positive

The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker. Chappell has finished 35th and 45th in two fall starts while Kirk has rattled off top 10s in three of four.
Chappell's  ->  positive

Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4. Not that we needed it, but that was a timely reminder of how good the two-time Open champ can be on links courses and T17 in the Travelers adds to the feeling that he’s in a good place again.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned. Spieth has played Pebble Beach five times, finishing 22nd, 4th, 7th, 21st, and 1st a year ago. The world's third-ranked golfer is 2nd in strokes gained: tee to green over the past 12 events but 144th with his putter.
Spieth  ->  positive

The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Paul Casey: One of the top golfers in the CSURAM88 Model, Casey is second and fourth with a 63.3 percent LT SC mark and 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score.
Paul Casey:  ->  positive

So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Over the years I've really dedicated myself to amassing knowledge of the golf course, keeping notes and carrying those notes forward year on year." Rose's "love affair" with Augusta started in 2003 when he finished T39 and that's actually his worst finish! Since then, he's bagged three top fives and a further two top 10s, with five other top 25s.
Rose's  ->  positive

After a frustrating first round last week, Finau rebounded strong after giving me high blood pressure for a few hours watching him hack away on shot tracker. Finau ranks 4th in GIR% and SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 16th in BoB%. Keep loading up on Finau as he is striking the ball well as of late.
Finau  ->  positive

Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st. Pair that with the fact that he's the world's number-one ranked golfer, and he's a really tough fade.
Johnson  ->  positive

The World Number 5 is in a rich vein of form and he continued that last week with 5th place at Copperhead. Despite grabbing the lead at the start of the final round, Rose struggled on Sunday, but if there's one thing we have learnt about the Englishman, it's to keep faith with him when he's playing well. Going back to 2012, here are Rose's performances in the tournament prior to the win: 5th, 8th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 22nd, 10th, 1st, 10th.
Rose  ->  positive

Kim, who even wears a Beatles badge on her golf cap, is a 29-year-old Korean. Matsuyama is a 25-year-old Japanese. So I’m not having it that he’s too young to have the most very basic grasp of pop culture.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ken Duke; 2) Ryan Armour; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) K.J. Choi; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Kevin Kisner; 7) Paul Casey; 8) Patrick Cantlay; 9) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel / Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman / Brian Stuard; 14) Brice Garnett; 15) Brian Gay; 16) David Lingmerth; 17) Jon Rahm; 18) Bryson DeChambeau; 19) Vaughn Taylor; 20) Tyler Duncan / Ben Martin.

Pat Perez;  ->  positive

Westwood's a Masters ringer with five top-8 finishes (including a pair of runner-ups) in the last seven Masters. Kevin Kisner ($6,900)  The runner-up at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Kisner has been playing steady golf of late. He made the cut in his first Masters appearance last year and should play the weekend at the very least.
Kisner  ->  positive

Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out. That effort at Bay Hill though was his sixth top-25 finish of the season, performing well at some correlating events.
Gay  ->  positive

He’s also 32nd in par-4 Birdie or Better percentage which is encouraging for this layout. Harris English ($7,000): English has been showing signs of life recently. His approach game has been improving of late and he was third in SG: Approach stats last week, after being first in this same stat a few weeks ago in Memphis.
Harris English  ->  positive

With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Also consider: Rickie Fowler, Emiliano Grillo, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka  Lower Priced Plays:  Here is a list of the lower priced players (below $8,000) we like this week on Draftkings that will be worth rostering:  Tony Finau ($7,900)  Byeong Hun-An ($6,900)  Patrick Cantlay ($7,800)  Peter Uihlein ($6,800)  Billy Horschel ($6,700)  Marc Leishman ($6,900)  Bill Haas ($6,900)  Brendan Steele ($6,700)  Kevin Tway ($6,500)  Other DraftKings Misprices:  This is something new we wanted to include in this weeks article as we believe there are several misprices that we can capitalize on to fit in some of the higher priced players. If you routinely visit our Player Model on the website, you know that we include tabs that compare Draftkings to FantasyDraft and Fanduel to exploit misprices.
Billy Horschel ($6,700) Marc Leishman ($6,900) Bill Haas  ->  positive

Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix. Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights.
Taylor  ->  positive

All the time Kirk is three-figures he is worth keeping an eye on in current form, and given his play here in 2013 I thought this could be another chance for him to finish inside the top-5. Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts.
Vaughn Taylor  ->  positive

Plus in truth, it will be an enormous shock were Martin Flores to challenge for the title, and it will be hard to get his odds to shorten up sufficiently to cash out. Though a winner on last year's Web.com Tour, Flores has rarely even contended at this level. Nevertheless, his credentials point to a respectable finish at least.
Flores  ->  positive

I’ll bet he makes it 3 for 3. Tony Finau is another big hitter whom I’d be considering for my lineup. Crooked Stick digs the long ball.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Other: Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Francesco Molinari, Phil Mickelson, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Russell Henley, Russell Knox, Stewart Cink, Ricky Barnes  – Charl Schwartzel, Harold Varner III, Peter Uihlein, Sam Saunders, Chez Reavie, Danny Lee, Smylie Kaufman  Bets:  Kyle Stanley 40-1  Peter Uihlein 60-1 ew  Stewart Cink 70-1 ew  Harold Varner III 80-1 ew  Ricky Barnes 200-1 ew  Chez Reavie 160-1 ew  San Saunders 200-1 ew He should be able to bounce back here and is capable of taking advantage of a weaker field to post a top ten finish. Last week he gained strokes on the field in approaches over three rounds, but had a terrible back nine on Sunday.
Ricky Barnes  ->  positive

Last year saw the Predictor highlight Ryan Moore in 5th spot at 25/1, plus Ricky Barnes (4th spot) at 125/1 which I also tipped - he finished T5. So at a tournament where a specific and consistent set of challenges has to be met year-in, year-out, I'm going to stick with 3 selections from the top 5 of this week's Predictor Model and Brian Harman leads the way. Harman tops the predictor by a large margin and it's easy to see why.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Rafa Cabrera Bello e.w. @ 60/1  Rahm touched on the great match play records of Spaniards so, from the land of Seve and Ollie, I'll also have punt on Rafa Cabrera Bello. There's very simple course and current form logic to this punt but, despite his obvious credentials, the price is a good one at 60/1.
Cabrera Bello  ->  positive

No reason why Spieth can’t win three straight. EXPERT JAMES HICKEY , Project Manager-Fantasy  LINEUP | BENCH Sergio Garcia  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  Brian Harman  Justin Rose  PROJECTED CHAMPION Hideki Matsuyama Trying to mix a competitive lineup while holding a few players back for the FedExCup Playoffs.

Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign. A win at the CIMB and a 5th at the CJ Cup in his last two starts suggests Perez is ready for another strong season and after four events currently sits in 2nd place in the FedEx Cup standings. Given his obvious liking for this course, his most recent performances and what appears to be a new winning swagger, Perez looks a decent price at 33/1 and worth a bet this week.
Perez  ->  positive

Studs  *In order of my rankings  Jordan Spieth ($11,400)  Spieth sputtered a bit last week at the U.S. Open but came storming back Sunday with a 69 in difficult conditions. Surprisingly, Spieth’s ball-striking was solid, but it was his trusty putter that let him down at Erin Hills. That’s a good sign moving forward because we know he’ll regain his touch on the greens.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Sentry Tournament of Champions (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jordan Spieth  Justin Thomas    You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks.

Cameron Smith … First-timer comin' in hot.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays. Scott Piercy ($8,900) – With few exceptions, Piercy has been rock solid over the past year at events far, far more challenging than the Sony Open, and I would expect his excellence to carry over well here again this year at a very reasonable price, just as he has over the past four years where he’s been inside the top 25 four out of five times, including a runner-up in 2015.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

After a solid performance in Sedgefield last week Sneds is certainly worth a second look here. Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

As far as recent performance goes Woodland has made seven straight cuts dating back to last season. Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Others to Consider  Jon Rahm ($9,700): Ranks third in driving distance, fourth in BoB%, sixth in T2G, and third in SG:OTT to the field over his last 24 rounds. Kevin Chappell ($7,000): Bomber who makes a lot of of birdies and always plays well at Quail Hollow. Great T2G player.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Madness to miss out on him at this price. Ryan Palmer 2 points each way at 40/1 with Sportnation.bet – Always pick Palmer in Texas, has had four top 10s here in his last three appearances in his home state. Can really attack the course and go on his famous birdie runs.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Indeed, he's no bigger for any of the four majors, yet here he does not have to beat the very best and nor does he have to prove that the course fits, because in six visits he's made five cuts, twice contending for the title, while even last year's 12th place included a third-round 65. Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson.
Fowler  ->  positive

I love Donald Ross' design. I think he's somewhat of a genius in terms of architecture and I've always enjoyed his golf courses, Donald confirmed. "The greens are very true, very fast, quite undulating.
Donald  ->  positive

Perez always had a reputation for being hot-headed on the course and maybe as he’s getting older and maturing he is getting this under control, which in turn is helping his results. Whatever the reasoning for it, Perez seems to have a new-found belief in recent years and a win here amongst the game’s elite would be the perfect way to start what he hopes to be another successful campaign. A win at the CIMB and a 5th at the CJ Cup in his last two starts suggests Perez is ready for another strong season and after four events currently sits in 2nd place in the FedEx Cup standings.
Perez  ->  positive

If his putter gets hot, that and his elite ball-striking makes him a strong contender this week in Mexico. Sergio Garcia ($8,500) – Garcia had another solid week at the Honda Classic, but made too many mistakes to contend. He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking.
Garcia  ->  positive

Billy Ho a name to watch this week at Valero: past 4 years: 4, 3, MC, 3. After MC this season: 2, 4, 13.

The logical place to start is with the 2008 edition at Royal Birkdale, so here are the stats for the first five and ties. 2008 Open Championship Top-Five  1 Padraig Harrington +3 DA 37 DD 45 GIR 30 SC 13 PA 4  2 Ian Poulter +7 DA 13 DD 50 GIR 7 SC 26 PA 37  T3 Greg Norman +9 DA 76 DD 37 GIR 38 SC 3 PA 21  T3 Henrik Stenson +9 DA 4 DD 18 GIR 38 SC 4 PA 31  T5 Jim Furyk +10 DA 26 DD 31 GIR 5 SC 24 PA 61  T5 Chris Wood +10 DA 32 DD 15 GIR 38 SC 10 PA 31    Stats Key  DA = Driving Accuracy  DD = Driving Distance  GIR = Greens In Regulation  SC = Scrambling  PA = Putting Average    Straight away we can see that no stat stands out blatantly. All six players scrambled well or reasonably well and that's understandable.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

Also, he’s played here at the Wells Fargo Championship each year since 2011 and his results have been steadily improving, finishing t-9th and t-14th the past two years. He may not seriously contend, but I like for Steele to post a sneaky top 10 finish this week. #isitThursdayyet  Joel Harrington  @joel4deepgolf
Steele  ->  positive

Value Picks and Sleepers  Rickie Fowler ($8,900)  Rickie Fowler is $8,900. For comparison, Patrick Reed is $9,200 and Brooks Koepka is $9,700 and are both ranked below Fowler in the OWGR. Rickie is a tough book to read.
Fowler  ->  positive

He is 20/1 because of the pure strength of the top of the market this week, but that’s big enough for me, considering his record here and wonderful current form. Hideki Matsuyama 40/1 (BetStars 5 places) 35/1 (Bet365 8 places, Boylesports and WilliamHill 7 places) 1pt e/w:  Hideki Matsuyama has been incredibly solid at Augusta over the last three years, finishing 5th, 7th and most recently 11th and he can go even better this week. After withdrawing from the Phoenix Open earlier this year with a wrist injury, Matsuyama made a return at Bay Hill, but could only finish T49.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending. In his last two starts, Rose has ranked 29th (Northern Trust) and 3rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Around-the-Green, so his play around the greens seems to coming round at the right time. Where he does still seem to be struggling is on the greens, ranking 61st (Northern Trust) and 23rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Putting.
Rose  ->  positive

His last three finishes at this event have been T17, T8 and T5 last year. Martin Laird ($7,400)  Laird is not a pick I would be trusting in cash games as he just hasn't been consistent here at Copperhead over the years. He has made four of six cuts but just one Top 10 back in 2011 before the course was updated.
Laird  ->  positive

Aaron Wise  It’s time to jump on the former NCAA individual champion’s bandwagon before it’s overflowing with bodies. After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside. A ball-striking and long-iron extraordinaire, Wise is better on approaches the further he is from the hole.
Wise  ->  positive

Other golfers who may go overlooked due to price this week with great records at TPC Boston include Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100) and Russell Henley ($7,600). From a price perspective, J.J. Spaun ($6,700), David Lingmerth ($6,700) and Chad Campbell ($6,700) all should be on the radar here as min-price tournament plays too. Recent Form  1.
David Lingmerth  ->  positive

He is ranked 44th in driving accuracy. Stewart Cink - $6,800 (150-1)  Cink is in the odd position of going 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National but never securing a top-25 (he was T27 and T26 the past two years). So, if you are looking for a bargain-basement price with a really good chance to make the cut, Cink is your man.
Cink  ->  positive

That was better than all of last year's top-five bar Spieth. Taking advantage of the four easiest holes at Augusta is, as mentioned, really important and while par-five performance has long been something of an issue for Haas, there's evidence to suggest he's getting to grips with this particular set. Finally, for one at such a price and without a major in the bag, Haas does have a heck of a lot of top-level form including his 2011 FedEx Cup success, which came here in Georgia, and three Presidents Cup appearances which he's desperate to add to with a fourth at Liberty National later this year.
Haas,  ->  positive

Luiten’s form is peaking at the moment, much better than last year’s form before Mexico, and, like Sergio, he just needs to be average on the greens to post a springily lofty finishing position. Adam Hadwin  With many looking ahead to next week when he defends his title at Copperhead, the Canadian is riding sneaky form into Mexico City — T6/T43/T35/T3. He lacks the driving distance of the favorites, but his accuracy is so good that he won’t necessarily need to club down, which should close the distance gap without sacrificing the number of fairways he hits.
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Back to the pick. Finau is another guy who really stands out in this mid-range as he checks almost every box. After an average start to the fall season(T26, T33, T41, CUT) he rebounded with a T9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions and a T20 at the Sony Open two weeks ago.
Finau  ->  positive

While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish. In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging. Last year Cauley shot his best round ever here with a 66 in the third round and also ranked number one in Par 5 Scoring for the week, which shows an increasing level of comfort with the venue.
Cauley  ->  positive

All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he’ll be in contention. Lucas Glover ($7200): Much like Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover is a player that is a huge step ahead of the field in terms of play from tee-to-green, but who struggles on the greens. Glover has always lacked a bit of distance off the tee (296.4 average), but over the years he’s consistently made up for it with a stellar second shot game (14th in SG: App) and with generally good accuracy off the tee (66.19%, 41st).
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

Hatton has a great record here finishing 13-46-10-6 in his last four appearances and looks in great form coming into this week. American Chez Reavie is also in fine fettle coming to California with five top 20’s in his last six starts. He started the season with a T13 at the Safeway Classic and followed that with a T17 at the CIMB Classic, T15 at the CJ Cup, T14 at OHL Classic and a T18 last week at the Sony.
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

My model likes him a lot and his course history matches that. $6k – a few darts  Hudson Swafford ($6900) – Slightly under-priced and has good history, I like my chances with him. Bryson DeChambeau ($6900) – I think long-term he is a better player than this price and provides some decent upside down in this range.
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

Schniederjans played fantastic at this venue last season finishing T9 on his debut. Lower down, I’d also highlight Alex Noren ($7,800), Kevin Streelman ($7,500), Harris English ($7,400) and Bryson DeChambeau ($7,200) as some high-upside targets. Top Strokes Gained: Tee to Green from Last Week  1.
Harris English  ->  positive

The Ryder Cup star began the final lap just a shot back following a Saturday 66 but couldn't find the magic that had brought him three wins in five starts at the back end of 2017 and had to settle for T5. It was still a strong week though and speaking ahead of his closer, Rose noted: "First couple days there's sketchy stuff tee to green, like my first round. And probably the most important round I played so far, hung in there and stuck with it.
Rose  ->  positive

On the European Tour he’s won three times – as recently as the Open de France earlier this summer, and has flashed the form to compete on any track in the world. Although it’s in a very small sample size, Fleetwood has been elite in terms of hitting fairways at a whopping 75.71% – but on the Euro Tour he’s been just as consistent, at 73.7% (12th). He’ll need to take that great play off the tee into Charlotte, because as great as the 26-year old has been, he still struggles with a putter in his hand.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Horschel is one to follow when hot and Win/Win scenarios of late have become a fairly regular occurrence. RESULT: T34  Kyle Stanley 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 plus 7 places each way, 1/5 odds - get it here:  Kyle Stanley is another I like this week. 27th here when playing as a web.com Tour player back in 2010 on course debut, he was 18th after 54 holes before a late Sunday pairing with K.J.
Kyle Stanley  ->  positive

Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Arnold Palmer Invitational - 2.5ew Fowler 18-1, Stenson 9-1
Fowler  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Ryan Moore EW @ 40/1  It's been said before that Copperhead also has plenty of nods towards courses in the Carolinas. So it's perhaps no coincidence that, just like Stenson, Ryan Moore is a former winner of the Wyndham Championship and has some excellent form here. Moore has been a regular visitor since coming on tour and as well as an early T8 in 2007 and a top 20 in 2009, he's been one of the best performers in this event over the last three years with finishes of 18-3-5.
Moore  ->  positive

He has a great record here over the last few years finishing T9 in 2013, a win in 2012, T7 in 2009 and a T24 in 2008. With home advantage and a great record here Moore could have a great week. Scott Piercy 28/1  Piercy had a bad start in China last week and found it hard to recover after an opening round 79.
Moore  ->  positive

Stay tuned! Core Players  Luke List ($9,900): List can absolutely crush the ball. The rough here isn’t as penal as we saw last weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational where the ball just stuck in the rough.
List  ->  positive

7th (2013) and 1st at East Lake (2014) across an elite-class field also shows that Horschel likes the rigours of a Donald Ross test. Success here at Sedgefield had been limited with a 30th, 46th, 47th and a MC from 4 appearances until 12 months ago when Horschel off of the back of some indifferent non-Bermuda form, very reminiscent to what we are seeing from him at the moment, finished 5th. Naturally with a Floridian upbringing, this Bermudagrass narrative makes plenty of sense and in this season alone, Horschel has finished 2nd at Sea Island, 4th at PGA National and 4th at TPC Southwind, with Bermudagrass making up 3 of his 4 top 5 finishes.
Horschel  ->  positive

Like DJ, his record on Bentgrass greens is very good and he arrives at Eagle Point in fair form given he was beaten in a playoff in Phoenix in February and that he was tied 11th at the Heritage last time out. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [6.4]  Webb Simpson @ [44.0]  Carl Pettersson @ [260.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow morning with my Golf Sixes preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
DJ,  ->  positive

Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice. DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th.
DJ:  ->  positive

In four starts here, Scott has a win, two top-14 finishes and just one MC (on debut in 2011) so it fair to say he should be comfortable with the layout. Scott ranked 3rd for Greens in Regulation last week at Riviera, but of course did not hole the amount of putts he needs to, to go low or in fact break par. He shots rounds of 72-72-71-71 and ranked 75th out of 76 qualifying players in Strokes-Gained: Putting, which is no surprise given he ranks 203rd in that area on Tour this season.
Scott  ->  positive

Casey finished 16th in the WGC Mexico Championship and he placed 11th in this year’s Honda Championship played at Fazio-designed PGA National. Casey is rarely going to make the most birdies in the field for a week, but what he will do is prevent disaster as he ranks 14th in bogey avoidance. He has a great tee-to-green game, ranking 16th on tour, and also ranks 21st in SG:App.
Casey  ->  positive

As with our first two picks this week it’s again hard not to see another big week for the Swede ahead. EMILIANO GRILLO – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 26th    I backed Grillo in this event last year and he duly lead the event on day one before sitting one shot of the pace at halfway. After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils.
Grillo  ->  positive

Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week. The 2014 FedEx Cup champion will be desperate to return to Augusta, where he posted a career-best T17 finish last year.
Horschel  ->  positive

🚨 Fantasy Alert 🚨 Charles Howell III has withdrawn from the @WMPhoenixOpen. Get your #FantasyGolf picks in at… https://t.co/Z78TkxzOC5
Charles Howell III  ->  negative

His game sets up well again this week and should be a consideration for tournament contests. -- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons.
Kirk  ->  positive

He can make birdies with the best of them as he finished last season ranked 19th in BoB%. Like Walker and Mickelson, O'Hair really loves putting on these Poa greens. He ranks in the top 20 of our TFF projections and is one of the top players under $8,000.
Walker  ->  positive

Finding players who can play in poor conditions can be a huge difference maker in constructing winning lineups. Open Championship Picks  Sergio Garcia – All Formats – DK:$ 10600 FD: $9600  At the top of the price range, I am really liking Sergio for the week. Sergio has been on fire this year (2 wins, three top tens, 10/10 made cuts), has historically been great at the Open Championship and has the game that lines up to perform well here.
Sergio  ->  positive

Selections  I had a shortlist of a half a dozen or so but the only two players I'm happy to back at the prices on offer are the aforementioned Chez Reavie and James Hahn. Hahn, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, ranks highly for both Par 4 Scoring and GIR, he was 11th in Phoenix in February and he's won at Quail Hollow. He's also averaged 4.5 birdies per round over the last three months - ranking sixth for Birdie Average.
James Hahn.  ->  positive

Just some sprinkles on Kizzire, Rodgers, Steele, Walker https://t.co/j6qIz4lHJy
Walker  ->  positive

No better place than where he picked up his first career PGA Tour win. Other Notable Stats Plays: Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Brendan Steele  Top Low-End Value Play  Byeong Hun An  World Golf Ranking (#56)  Vegas Odds (55/1)  Draftkings ($6,900)  FanDuel ($7,500)    This is the golfer who's price really stood out this week as being way too low. He played here for the first time last year, finishing T11 after missing his previous two cuts going into the tournament.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

So look for players who are excellent Bermudagrass putters and who can convert birdie chances, rather than pure ball-strikers. Winners : 2017: Justin Thomas (-27); 2016: Fabian Gomez (-20); 2015: Jimmy Walker (-23); 2014: Jimmy Walker (-17); 2013: Russell Henley (-24); 2012: Johnson Wagner (-13); 2011: Mark Wilson (-16); 2010: Ryan Palmer (-15). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

He is my favourite pivot play this week. Harris English – $8,400  Harris English has been sneaky good lately, especially in his approach game. He ranks 1st in SG:APP and 3rd in DK points over his past 12 rounds in the field.
Harris English  ->  positive

How about: he's got two top-sixes and two more top-20s to start the year; he's made five straight cuts at Riviera; he's from Southern California and knows kikuyu; and he's fifth in scrambling, 13th in GIR and T26 in proximity. J.B. Holmes - $7,100 (40-1)    The oddsmakers don't consider DFS pricing before acting, but Holmes' price certainly doesn't jibe with his odds, and in a good way. He has had great success at Riviera, with six top-12s through the years, including T11 last year.
Holmes  ->  positive

If this does come to fruition we are looking at one tough week and I would imagine the winning score will be nowhere near as low as last year! PICKS  I have gone with 5 players this week as follows;  RUSSELL KNOX – 55-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED - M/C  I mentioned above that one tried and tested formula for finding the right men to go with when the tour hits Florida is to look for the East Coast specialists who have performed beyond their normal expectations during the West Coast swing and Knox is one player this year who certainly fits that mould. Over recent years Russell has either not bothered with the West Coast or performed patchily at best, in fact the last year before this that he had a top 20 on the West Coast was 2015 and he went on to finish 3rd at the Honda Classic.
Russell  ->  positive

Can't get behind Na, either; he's missed the weekend his past three trips here, and his only performance of note (T-9) came in 2007. As for Spieth, Day and McIlroy: they definitely aren't my favorites. Spieth's flat stick continues to be an issue, and though River Highlands' greens will be a respite from the Open dance floors, he's not shown the type of putting consistency that instills conviction.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley ($9,600) – It feels weird going back to Stanley after a victory but then I ask myself who else are you going to take in this field? Stanley ranks 2nd SG: T2G, 12th OTT and 9th in Approach his last 36 rounds on Bent grass. Stanley has a spot secured in the Open next weekend but my gut tells me this guy still grinds it out this week regardless to fine tune.
Stanley  ->  positive

Double major winner Spieth was T4 at Riviera in 2015 after T12 the year before and Matsuyama has course form of 11-4-23. But on this course where length is a definite advantage (Bubba Watson has won it in two of the last three years), I give Johnson the edge. Jason Day's chance looks less obvious given finishes of MC-MC-62 although they came from 2010-2012.
Johnson  ->  positive

Year Finish Position 2016 9 2015 39 2014 11 2013 30 2012 1  Another week, another Tony Finau ($8,700) recommendation. Finau has been playing extremely well this year. He is making cuts at close to the highest rate of his career and is slowly creeping up the OWGR.
Finau  ->  positive

Abraham Ancer 125/1 (Betfair/Paddypower and Boyleports 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Despite being raised in Mexico, Abraham Ancer was born in Texas and currently resides in San Antonio, and he will look to carry his trending form over as he plays at “home” for the second straight event. In his last three starts, Ancer has finished T16 (Valspar), T13 (Corales) and T8 (Houston) and should he keep this form up he may well contend for his second win as a professional and first on the PGA Tour. A winner already on the Web.com Tour in 2015, it is clear Ancer is an improving talent who will be looking to take advantage of a weakened field, building particularly on his last start.
Ancer  ->  positive

The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
Horschel  ->  positive

He also enters the week fresh off of two solid finishes in his last two starts, so it feels like just the right time to own Wagner -- especially for the bargain price of $5,300. -- Zach Turcotte  David Lingmerth  All things considered, Lingmerth might be the best overall fantasy golfer on FanDuel this week. He continues to show solid form with recent finishes of T5, T26, T21, T15 and T12, and also has a decent overall game for the Old White TPC.
David Lingmerth  ->  positive

There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out. As shown above, I'm very keen on Jordan Spieth while it's hard to ignore the claims of Hideki Matsuyama. The Japanese golfer was the hottest player on the planet at the end of 2016 after finishing with four wins (Japan Open, WGC-HSBC Champions, Taiheiyo Masters and Hero World Challenge) and a second.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin: Hadwin has only played here twice, but he hasn’t finished worse than 22nd in either appearance. Hadwin’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score is 10th, his 60.6 LT SC percentage is 19th, and his 14.4 LT Adj Bird Avg ranks ninth in the field. Pat Perez: With zero missed cuts and seven top-25 finishes in 2017, Perez comes into this event in fabulous form.
Adam Hadwin:  ->  positive

He also finished T9 at the Frankie Templeton Shootout, but as this is an unofficial event it seems silly to count it. Whilst Berger has hardly made a blistering start to the season, it has been steady enough and I am hoping he will build on that T7 finish last time out. On his debut at this event, Berger finished 2nd (lost in a play-off) to Padraig Harrington back in 2015.
Berger  ->  positive

At that point if anyone had told you that Lovemark would remain winless on the PGA tour more than 8yrs later you’d have said they were stark raving bonkers, however that is unfortunately the case. The main reason for this of course is that Lovemark’s career was derailed by a major back problem in 2010, which ultimately required surgery in 2011. After time off for the necessary rehab Jamie a historical fader of the ball had developed a hook in his game, which coupled with the pressure he was under to fulfil a Major Medical Exemption lead to real struggles on the course.
Lovemark  ->  positive

Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state. Piller has been wildly inconsistent on the PGA Tour, despite being a six-time winner on the Web.com Tour, one of which came last year to help secure his PGA Tour card this season. Whilst he hasn’t yet been able to make the step up and win on the main Tour, he has finished inside the top-5 on multiple occasions, including here when finishing T4 in 2016.
Piller  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy should probably join him in the top 10 (or five) but Stenson's been there and done it on this course whereas Rory hasn't. I'm tempted to support Justin Rose but will take Paul Casey at the bigger top 10 price of [4.70]. The Englishman has latest Florida form of 11-23-9-7 (the 9th coming in this event) and he putts well on Bermuda greens.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Paul Casey ($10,200): I feel like I am beating the drum week after week here with Casey but he really has been excellent over his past few starts. Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings. Given the potentially high winds I do think this is a field in which you can potentially fade the top three options and still field a winning gpp roster and Casey might be the man to target if you are going after that strategy.
Casey  ->  positive

Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early. Whilst question marks still remain as to whether Kokrak is a winner at this level, he has had plenty of near misses and will probably get over the line eventually. What is not in doubt is his ability to go low on any given round, especially on a Thursday, and that’s all we need from him.
Kokrak  ->  positive

Patrick Reed ($9,500): Reed may not have the razor sharp approach game that Casey has but he should be a good fit this week regardless as he can make up strokes at this venue with his improving short game and putter. Reed has a boom or bust history at this event with two top-twenties and two missed cuts over his last four appearances but I’m comfortable using him here as the real American hero has only finished outside of the top 25 once in his last six starts. Kyle Stanley ($8,400): I’m not sure if Stanley necessarily has what it takes to win at this venue, but like Casey his approach game can be so good at times that a shaky putter shouldn’t matter too much.
Reed  ->  positive

He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years. Haas only has seven tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to an equally priced Byeong Hun An, who has 20.
Haas  ->  positive

Here are my selections for the 2017 Sony Open. Pat Perez 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w  Pat Perez at 40/1 is one of those picks I struggle to make, but also find terribly difficult to ignore. Perez returned to action last October at the CIMB Classic and finished T33.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Only reason I'm leaving him on the bench to begin with is because I have one start remaining. EXPERT BEN EVERILL , Staff Writer LINEUP | BENCH Jason Day  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Adam Scott  Dustin Johnson  Rory McIlroy  PROJECTED CHAMPION Adam Scott Former champion needs a kick for his season to be up to standard. Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

In addition to last week, his form in limited starts at Torrey Pines is solid. Cauley is the only pick this week that doesn’t have a top-10 here before but he does have two top-25’s in three starts. He finished T13 on debut in 2012 but missed the cut the following year.
Cauley  ->  positive

He only finished behind winner, Bubba Watson and runner-up Dustin Johnson so he was bettered by two of the very best on the PGA Tour. In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory.
Harman  ->  positive

He started with an opening round 64 and followed that with 67,65,71 to post 13 under. Stanley has a good record in Torrey over the last few years and came close to victory in 2012.He had a healthy three shot lead on the 18th tee and ended up taking a disappointing triple bogey after finding water short of the 18th green and went on to lose a playoff to Brandt Snedeker. Despite that collapse, Stanley seems to like this course finishing T25 in 2016 and T14 last year and looks great value to have a good week here.
Stanley  ->  positive

Marc Leishman was giving both Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth all they could handle at TPC Boston last Monday, but ultimately - with a 2-shot lead on the 10th tee - the pressure got to him. However from adversity we've seen players blossom and Leishman, who sits 7th in the FedEx Cup standings, has the kind of result CV that links beautifully to previous winners here Zach Johnson and Jason Day. 5th at Waialae in 2014 (Johnson was winner there in 2009), 2nd at Torrey Pines in both 2010 and 2014 (Day was a winner there in 2015), 1st at Bay Hill this year (Day won there in 2016), 4th at Augusta in 2013 (Johnson won there in 2007, Day 2nd in 2011), 3rd at TPC Four Seasons in both 2012 and 2014 (Day won there in 2010), 2nd at St Andrews in 2015 (Johnson won the title, with Day 4th a single shot out of the Playoff), plus 3rd at Firestone in 2014 (Johnson was 2nd there this year), highlight that Leishman can circulate in very high echelons when he plays his very best golf.
Leishman  ->  positive

Finally Huh has some eye catching progressively improving form at Copperhead with finishes of 33rd, 22nd and then 9th over the past three years, which gives further cause for optimism of a good week ahead. DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 100-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 31st  The mention of Bozzelli above leads me on nicely to my last selection of the week. Regular readers will know that I was on Bozzelli a couple of weeks ago at the Honda at the massive odds of 350-1.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

10th (2014) and 4th (2017) at Sea Island and 3rd at PGA West (2017) also marry-up perfectly from a comfortable on TifDwarf Bermudagrass greens perspective. Cameron Smith 1pt EW 40/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Regular readers will know I'm a fan of Cameron Smith and golf betting is often a game of patience. Scrolling down to the bottom of the Sentry leaderboard early last Friday morning and seeing young Mr Smith ensconced in tied 30th spot alongside Jordan Spieth was not something I anticipated.
Smith  ->  positive

He rode a hot putter to a T8 in last weekends Sanderson Farms Championship and if he ride that momentum he could grab another Top 10 this week. Also Consider - Jamie Lovemark  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Jason Bohn  World Golf Ranking (165)  Vegas Odds (101/1)  Draftkings ($6,200)  FantasyAces ($4,500)    If you are looking for GPP value, Jason Bohn is it this week. He comes back to TPC Summerlin with outstanding course history, making all seven cuts and finishing T2, T18, T2, T8 his last four trips to Las Vegas.
Jason Bohn  ->  positive

DJ got the monkey off his back thanks to a brilliant and bold display in last year's US Open and, with the weight lifted, I expect more to follow quickly. There were 10 years between Nick Faldo's Augusta debut and his first green jacket so we can forgive Johnson for taking his time to crack the code at Augusta National. This is his eighth appearance in the year's first major and the knocks at the door are getting louder.
Johnson  ->  positive

Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well. Other to Consider: Rickie Fowler (Cash)  Mid-Tier Targets:  David Lingmerth (DK: $8,500, FD: $7,200)    Lingmerth won the Web.com event when it was played at TPC Potomac a few years ago, and he is playing some great golf at the moment.
Haas  ->  positive

He's showing signs of a turn-back-the-clock season with top-25 finishes in his last three starts. Patrick Reed ($8,300)  In four career starts at Pebble, Reed has finishes of T6, T7 and T13 and no missed cuts. His ability to string together flurries of birdies always makes him an intriguing fantasy option.
Reed  ->  positive

Australians have a nice record at this event and Adam Scott (a former winner) could go overlooked due to his lack of play.

KEY STATS FOR DFS PGA THIS WEEK:  Strokes Gained T-G Strokes Gained Putting GIR Par 4 Scoring Birdie or Better Drive Distance Scrambling  DraftKings PGA Picks of the Week  Henrik Stenson ($11700)  Stenson is an interesting name for me this week as he’s a guy I believe can shine, but he did have his struggles at Bethpage the last time The Barclays rolled through there. He’s been as good as anyone all year over his last seven events with T4, WIN, T13, WIN, T7, 2nd place finishes, and a WD mixed in which he actually was doing quite well prior to withdrawing.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
Poston  ->  positive

Charles Howell III;  ->  positive

A guy with another good combination of LT Adj Rd and LT DD is J.B. Holmes, who has finished 68th, 12th, and 52nd over his last three tournaments; he’s a volatile player perfect for guaranteed prize pools (GPPs). Holmes has a massive 315.4-yard LT DD, and his 13.7 Long-Term Birdies Per Tournament is the fourth-best mark in the field. He has respectable odds to win the tournament at 2.4 percent, which isn’t bad for his $8,500 price tag on DraftKings.
J.B. Holmes,  ->  positive

Zach Johnson – $7,700  Zach Johnson has found a lot of consistency in Scottsdale. In his past three trips to the WMO, Johnson has a T10, T14 and T12. Another result like that would be perfect for a $7,700 golfer.
Johnson  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Piller  ->  positive

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Peter Uihlein; 2) Wesley Bryan / Freddie Jacobson / Matt Jones; 5) Graeme McDowell; 6) Thorbjorn Olesen; 7) J.T. Poston; 8) Camilo Villegas; 9) Ryo Ishikawa; 10) Jonas Blixt / Hunter Mahan / Ian Poulter / Seamus Power; 14) Graham DeLaet; 15) Chris Kirk; 16) Ken Duke; 17) Brian Campbell / Tim Wilkinson; 19) Scott Brown / Andres Gonzales.

Jonas Blixt  ->  positive

Perhaps more importantly, he’s been longer off the tee of late, averaging a Recent DD of 305.2 yards. Cink doesn’t have any history at this course, but he allows you to take a stars-and-scrubs lineup approach. A guy with another good combination of LT Adj Rd and LT DD is J.B. Holmes, who has finished 68th, 12th, and 52nd over his last three tournaments; he’s a volatile player perfect for guaranteed prize pools (GPPs).
Cink  ->  positive

To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well. That history may be the one thing that keeps Fowler’s ownership down, which would be an added bonus. In almost every important aspect as it relates to the course this week, Fowler is elite.
Fowler  ->  positive

Harman should find himself in the middle of the pack this week and these odds are too great to pass up. Also, Harman shot a 61 in the second round of the 2012 Honda Classic, which is a course record, so he does have some history on this course and a great feel for things. Harman has produced four of those top-25 finishes in his last five events overall.
Harman  ->  positive

In-form Chez Reavie and Tommy Fleetwood, who should take to the track, were both on the radar but I felt they were both fractionally short so my four are Kevin Streelman, Charl Schwartzel, William McGirt and KJ Choi. Streelman currently ranks third for GIR and second for Scrambling on the PGA Tour so he emphatically ticks the correct stats boxes. McGirt is also a great statistical fit with decent recent form and very solid course form (sixth, 14th and 20th last three visits) and KJ Choi could get in the mix again at a venue he loves, given he was on the fringes of contention last week.
Kevin Streelman,  ->  positive

Could Phil parlay a 3 week stretch ending with another green jacket? Russell Henley ($8,700) Three top 10’s here and coming off 3 straight made cuts with a top 10 at Valspar. Everything seems to be pointing to a 4 th straight top ten at the SHO.
Russell Henley  ->  positive

I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week. Safely qualified for the Ryder Cup team (as Kuchar was when winning this in 2010), Walker's results CV looks very similar to that of Nick Watney with a plethora of top finishes on the West Coast across Torrey Pines, Pebble Beach, CordeValle and Riviera, so we know he can perform well on putting surfaces with Poa Annua in them. That fact is backed up by his win at Baltusrol which ticks the won 'Up-State' box.
Walker  ->  positive

Well, he has posted nine Top-10 finishes in his past 10 starts, including a win at thein China, and consecutive Top 5s in his last two turns at the Valspar Championship and Arnold Palmer Invitational. Unlike Phil, who’s using this as a tune-up event, Rose showed last year that he’s game to compete, churning out againing the third-most strokes with his irons, before inevitably dropping the Masters playoff tothe following week. It’s somewhat concerning that Rose has used a hot putter to propel himself to those lofty finishes in the past two events (at least 6.7+ SG: PUTT in each), but he’s one of the premier long-iron players in the field, tops in Birdies or Better Gained over the past 50 rounds and third in Par 5s Gained in that same stretch.
Rose  ->  positive

I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different. My only concern with Walker is whether or not he can stay out of trouble on what seems to be a course that requires some level of accuracy. The other standout on this chart is Johnattan Vegas who comes in near the minimum price and is coming into the event with incredible form.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Well on this occasion I’ve decided to stick with the latter. We start therefore with an unapologetic pick of last week’s winner Justin Thomas. JT’s credentials don’t really need much explanation however there are two things to highlight that draw me to him this week rather than to say DJ the defending champion and other market leader.
JT’s  ->  positive

Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Sentry Tournament of Champions and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.

Tyrrell Hatton;  ->  positive

UPPER TIER  Matt Kuchar ($9,400) – Steady Kuchar looked like a potential cut risk on Thursday/Friday last week, but in typical Kuchar fashion, he rallied back for a nice and easy T12 finish. There is nobody in this field with a better overall track record at this course, and when it comes to smooth, steady T2G play, Kuchar is among the best ever. Lock him in.
Kuchar  ->  positive

Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Sony Open / South African Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) John Peterson; 2) Stuart Appleby; 3) Joel Dahmen / Boo Weekley / Steve Wheatcroft; 6) Zac Blair; 7) Graeme McDowell; 8) Matt Jones; 9) Ryan Armour / Richy Werenski; 11) Andrew Johnston; 12) Hunter Mahan; 13) Ben Crane / Ken Duke; 15) Fabrizio Zanotti; 16) David Hearn; 17) Graham DeLaet; 18) Alex Cejka / Brett Drewitt / Danny Lee / Tim Wilkinson. Greens in Regulation : 1) Greg Owen; 2) Luke List; 3) Peter Uihlein; 4) D.A.
Danny Lee  ->  positive

Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play. Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G.
Suri  ->  positive

Selections  Jon Rahm @ [12.5]  J.B. Holmes @ [48.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter He's always been a very streaky type but well capable of winning when in form, so last week's return to contention at Torrey Pines could be significant. J.B. Holmes is a twice former winner of this title and has a couple of further top-six finishes among his record.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

Finally, whilst, as I’ve also noted above, past course form is not a requisite here it naturally doesn’t do any harm to have some and as a previous winner of the event Kevin is bound to have really positive vibes returning to the Copperhead track and I can see him going really close again this week. LUCAS GLOVER – 100-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 7 Finished 74th  In a week where if the forecast turns out to be correct and the wind blows, I am keen to have some serious ‘ball strikers’ on our side and there are none better in that department than the South Carolinian native Lucas Glover. When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th.
LUCAS GLOVER  ->  positive

I like DJ just fine but I’ll save and spend elsewhere for this LU. The next tier gives you some great options like JB (Don’t call me John) Holmes, Reed, Castro, and Blixt. After the MC in Phoenix I’ll take Castro to bounce back and hope some are scared off Roberto.
Reed,  ->  positive

Also Consider: Ollie Schniderjans, Russell Henley, Tommy Fleetwood, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Webb Simpson, Beyong–Hun An, Charles Howell (14/16 here, and has now made ten straight cuts, great value at only $6,900), Anirban Lahiri, and Billy Horschel. Regardless of what his ownership level ends up being (13-16% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs), Kaymer is an absolute steal at $7,400, and is a strong play in both cash games and GPPs. He has only played here at Bayhill once, missing the cut back 2008, but this was a long time ago, and Kaymer is a world class player who is in great current form.
Anirban Lahiri,  ->  positive

He missed the cut in Malaysia last week and was said to be carrying some sort of injury so he's a risky proposition but I couldn't let him go un-backed at that price. Selection:  Charl Schwartzel @ [90.0]    I'll be back on Friday after the first round with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

Lowry hasn't set the world alight on the PGA Tour this year, with a missed cut at Torrey Pines and a 65th placed-finish in the Phoenix Open on Sunday, but he's a great links exponent and poa annua putter and he was in-form before Christmas. His tournament form figures read 21-41-14 and I thought he was just worth chancing at [95.0]    Selections:  Chez Reavie @ [75.0]  Shane Lowry @ [95.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with my ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Chez Reavie  ->  positive

Rahm  ->  positive

He has just been so damn consistent this season compared to the other options it’s pretty much a no brainer. Fowler is the clear favorite to win this week and is obviously the least likely to miss the cut. If you have to back only one golfer from +$10k, it’s 100% Fowler.
Fowler  ->  positive

He’s T14 in Total Driving, has been absolutely nails in finding greens (73.06%, 8th on Tour), and has an outstanding birdie average of 4.25. Given how high the ownership will be on both Finau and Steele, using Greg Owen in a stars & scrubs format will help ease the ownership burden, with lots of upside to score well on DraftKings. Owen made the cut last year and finished T65, and in 2010 finished T41.
Finau  ->  positive

The 2007 Masters Champion Zach Johnson, once said “You just have to be on your toes on every single putt you ever have in the Masters.” Spieth’s elite putting ability gives him an edge at Augusta. Spieth’s 17.1 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is also elite and gives him extra value, given the DraftKings scoring system. Rory McIlroy and the scorching-hot Dustin Johnson are the only golfers in the Masters field with higher LT Adjusted Birdie Averages.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

At third in strokes-gained off-the-tee so far this season, Molinari junior is exuding control from the tee as usual and that formula is a good one here. Molinari's form figures don't look altogether inspiring, but I don't believe he's played in a truly suitable event so far this season. There are no excuses on that score now returned to Florida, where he's also built up a fine record in the not dissimilar PLAYERS Championship as well as here at Bay Hill.
Molinari  ->  positive

Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
@K_Kisner  ->  positive

While Blair hasn’t finished higher than 40th in his last six events, he does have 12th- and eighth-place finishes on his resume this season. Sha Na Na  Unlike Blair, Kevin Na is in good form, tied for 19th in the field with his 69.2 Rec Adj Rd Score. Na’s Rec GIR percentage (66.7) and Rec DA percentage (69.7) rank within the top 10, and his 14.5 Rec Adj Bird Avg is 14th overall.
Blair  ->  positive

He could threaten a place putting badly and it's in the hope that a few weeks off have helped him find something that the Kentucky native gets the vote. Of the many tempting options at three-figure prices, it's Andrew Landry who stands out. Born in Texas, Landry won a couple of minor tour events in his home state before turning professional and hinting that difficult conditions may bring out his best when scoring a five-shot victory in 11-under-par on the Web.com Tour.
Landry  ->  positive

Final selections –  Jordan Spieth 13/2 1pt EW  Rickie Fowler 16/1 0.5pts EW  Russell Henley 33/1 0.5pts EW  Billy Horchel 45/1 0.5pts EW  Total Staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6 Pressure could be a big motivator for Horchel here so he could be worth chancing. Statswise he ranks fourth in GIR, 35th in SGTTG, 34th in SG approaches to the green and 26th in par 4 scoring.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Bradley was first for greens in regulation at the Travelers so his irons were dialled in while he was third on the All-Around so did everything well. If form from another North West event transfers well, then Bradley's superb performances in the WGC-Bridgestone at Firestone in Ohio could provide a good clue. Like Potomac it's a par 70 with bentgrass greens and Bradley has a win, a second, a fifth and nothing worse than T17 in five starts there.
Bradley's  ->  positive

Few in the field will be playing with as much confidence. Also like: Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

2. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  negative

We're relying on Mickelson having given an honest assessment but he's been good for that in the past and, at the price and in an event where most have some kind of question to answer, he's worth a decent each-way bet. Those who read every word of my 2018 Money List preview may have noticed that I put forward this event as a decent opportunity for Aaron Wise and Beau Hossler, and nothing has changed my mind on that since. Justin Thomas threatened to win it straight off the Web.com Tour and the three courses used are set up straightforwardly, much like most of the events on the feeder circuit.
Aaron Wise  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Rory Sabbatini ($7,200)  There’s a distinct lack of quality at the very bottom end of this field, but there are still some plays worth talking about a little higher up. One of those is definitely Rory Sabbatini. After a poor start to this season, Sabbatini has ramped things up lately, with five straight made cuts; four of which were top-25 finishes.
Sabbatini  ->  positive

Despite all of the options in this deep field, what's notable is that the push is in play. Circle Matsuyama and move on. You're fine.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Hossler is currently trading at 200+ whilst Jaeger is at 250+ Unfortunately the exchange market is fairly weak in this event at the moment so neither players exchange price are quite where I'd hoped for at this stage, but both are still worth supporting..Hossler has also been strongly tipped elsewhere. With Jaegar again it was a case of his ability to go low should suit this event and I was also mindful that one of his wins on the Web.com last year came in a pro am event.
supporting..Hossler  ->  positive

Coming off a great U.S. Open, Steele ranks 6th in Par 4 Scoring, 14th in BoB%, and 19th in SG:T2G. Paul Casey ($9,700) – Our final cash game staple, Casey has been playing solid golf this year. If only he could’ve avoided the fescue on the weekend at Erin Hills.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Simply put, the winner will likely be an experienced player with elite ball-striking who rolls in a few more putts than normal due to the easy conditions and putting surfaces. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jordan Spieth, $12,800 – Spieth finished third at Waialae last year after a three-year hiatus from the event, so expect high caliber play from the superstar youngster. Spieth should have no problem making oodles of birdies if he can hit it reasonably off the tee box.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Russell Henley has played outstanding golf almost all season, with an early season equipment change doing wonders for his approach game specifically. Henley has always been good off the tee and on the greens, but his new found efficiency is pushing him towards the top of the tour in many other stats as well. He ranks 13th in Par 4 Scoring overall and is seventh on tour in efficiency on par 4s from 450-500 yards (and 10th from 400-450 yards).
Russell Henley  ->  positive

I used this chart earlier with Reavie, but I love how it shows a golfer’s performance compared to how the field did for that round. Kuchar rarely disappoints us relative to the competition or any given round which makes him a superb building block anytime we can catch him for a fair price. Below $14,000  Rafa Cabrera Bello ($13,800)  Seems the flavor of this range is European’s lately.
Kuchar  ->  positive

I know he's not been at his best of late but this place really suits him and I was delighted to get a triple-figure price. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [6.4] (saver)  Kevin Streelman @ [100.0]  Charl Schwartzel @ [120.0]  William McGirt @ [180.0]  K.J Choi @ [410.0]  I'll be back later with my Oman Open preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
William McGirt  ->  positive

Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
Steve Stricker  ->  positive

Can’t believe the 250/1 on Ogilvy in Vegas is still standing. 200/1 Sabbatini very big also. Small dart at Hoge 200/1 too

Piercy ranks eighth in SG off the tee, ninth in SGTTG and tenth in SG Approaches to the green. With a great record here and good current form Piercy could be another player to keep an eye on here. Harold Varner 80/1  I was quite surprised to see Harlod Varner at such a big price considering he’s in great form coming to Hawaii this week.
Piercy  ->  positive

Later in the week, I will update SlackChat with how my ownership will end up in GPP’s. Paul Casey – GPP – DK:$9400 FD: $11600  Definitely check back into our SlackChat as this thought could change but I think looking at pricing Paul Casey could come in very under-owned and give you a top-end talent playing well with low ownership. Casey’s price makes him tough to roster if going for any of the top end guys and I think it is much easier when constructing rosters to spend less on Cantlay, Kucher or Perez.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016. At 66th in the PGA Tour Driving Distance stats, Phil has taken an average of 6 yards off of his driving to hit more fairways in a bid to hit far more greens.
Mickelson  ->  positive

The list goes on with legitimate cases quite feasible for Paul Casey, Tyrrell Hatton and Thomas Pieters but it's G-Mac at 50s that gets my vote. I will go for an American by taking Zach Johnson and making it a hat-trick of major winners on my team this week. The former Masters and Open champ is another with some impressive history here without actually winning.
Zach Johnson  ->  positive

Both Summerhays and Rodgers are intriguing to me having made exactly four cuts in a row each. With Rodgers we’re typically used to a very streaky set of results with missed cuts and upside being the normal mix, and Rodgers coming in off of a second place finish at the John Deer Classic two weeks ago leaves me wondering if his upward trend will continue. Either way both Summerhays and Rodgers will definitely make their way into my GPP lineups this week.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Maybe that’s because he’s in his comfort zone so he can miss a putt every now and again and it doesn’t define whether he wins or loses, so because he can, he probably misses less of them. Harrington on Jordan Spieth:  Jordan clearly has the X-factor. He plays golf pretty much like everybody else but he has that something special and he brings it to Augusta.
Jordan  ->  negative

He has made three of four cuts with top-10 and top-20 finishes. Mullinax leads the field with his robust 71.5 percent Recent Greens in Regulation percentage, and he is second with his 322.8-yard Recent DD. Importantly, Mullinax’s 13.4 LT Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament ranks eighth.
Mullinax  ->  positive

And until we see otherwise, Day is still among the very best putters in the game. Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that.
Reed  ->  positive

A second-round 76 cost Berger a real chance of finishing inside the top-5 at Birkdale, ultimately having to settle for a modest T27. A solid four rounds at Firestone followed, which led to a T17 finish there but a real low round was absent from Berger’s four scorecards last week. Berger has two starts at the Wells Fargo Championship, finishing 28th on debut in 2015 before improving in 2016 with a 17th, so there is an expectation for him to improve again on his third start at Quail Hollow, even with the changes to the course taken into account.
Berger  ->  positive

He's been a bit disappointing since he successfully defended in Phoenix in February with a missed cut at the Genesis Open and a 25th placed finish in Mexico but I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised to see him bounce back here. Selections    I've played both Henrik Stenson and Hideki Matsuyama towards the head of the market and I've alo backed Zach Johnson and Morgan Hoffman. This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won.
Morgan  ->  positive

Dufner has posted six top-15 finishes in his past ten stroke play events. Paul Casey ($10,200) – People looking at Casey’s recent history here (43rd, MC) will be turned off, but he’s posted 13th and 5th place finishes previously at Colonial. When we’re targeting accurate ball-strikers, Casey pops to the top of our list.
Casey  ->  positive

4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
Walker  ->  positive

Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

He's one of the nicest characters in the world of sport, let alone golf, and he has a fabulous chance but it's all there to be seen and his price is bang on. Selections  I backed Jordan Spieth last week at [17.0] and I'm more than happy to have him onside. I'm a big fan of course form at this event and after a decent week in Houston he looks nicely primed to perform well here again.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

But there's a lot of holes where you can make birdie." Johnson gives the impression he's only flexing his muscles at the moment and yet already the World No.3 has posted T6 in the SBS Tournament of Champions, T2 in Abu Dhabi and that solo third at Pebble Beach. "I feel like the game's in really good shape.
Johnson  ->  positive

Across the European, Tour Li has sprung up inside of the top 10 four times in sixteen starts, pretty impressive. Coming off of a missed cut and in a price range with lots of playable options, I would expect Li to see low ownership despite his high upside. Although he missed the cut last week at the PGA Championship he only missed by one stroke, his game is still there and if Li can get hot no one should be surprised if he gets his breakthrough win.
Li  ->  positive

All the time Kirk is three-figures he is worth keeping an eye on in current form, and given his play here in 2013 I thought this could be another chance for him to finish inside the top-5. Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts.
Taylor  ->  positive

With five straight top-8 finishes which include four top-5’s, it is now time for Harman to capitalise on some special form. Harman has made huge strides as a player over the last couple of years and whilst his win at the Wells Fargo was just his second on the PGA Tour, and his first for three years, he now looks ready to become a perennial winner on Tour. The potential has been there ever since Harman was an amateur winning multiple times, as well as playing on winning Palmer and Walker Cup teams.
Harman  ->  positive

Harold Varner III 70/1 - T34 at Bay Hill, T11 thru 54 holes. 4th in the field in SG Approach. Beat a better field in Australia in December.
Harold Varner  ->  positive

His form is the best on TOUR at the moment, and he now travels to Kuala Lumpur CC, where he’s won the previous two years. Thomas ranks first in our Cheat Sheet, converting birdies at the highest rate, 2nd best in Par 4 Scoring, and 6th in T-G. He ranks no lower than 47th in any stat we’ve looked at this week and while he’s the most expensive on DraftKings by a pretty large margin, he’s the favorite to win this week, so you’ll want him in your lineups.
Thomas  ->  positive

It helps obviously the experience I have had here". 71-68-68-70 last week at the AT&T Byron Nelson to finish in a tie for 27th, Palmer has been looking forward to this week for quite some time. Ahead of the Texas two week stretch last season he pointed out "Colonial is very special to me, it is the one event that I would cherish the most and I would look good in that colour".
Palmer  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth  MY PICK : Louis Oosthuzien ($9,100)  Oosthuizen started the playoffs strong last week with a T10. While he was somewhat wild off the tee at Glen Oaks, Oosthuizen’s approach game was on point as he gained over 4.2 strokes on the field in approaches and was T3 for the week in Greens in Regulation. The South African has come close to winning multiple times this year in strong field events, and the venue this week clearly speaks to him as he’s landed finishes of T12-T8-T2 at TPC Boston over his last three appearances – a record which includes six of his last 12 rounds being 67 or better.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

BEAU HOSSLER – 150-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 2nd  For my final selection this week I am going to roll the dice again with a player who we were on earlier in the year in the form of Beau Hossler. Regular readers of my work will know that I picked Hossler as one of my players to follow for 2018 and on the West Coast swing he was certainly living up to the bill. As a native Californian it’s not surprising that Beau cooled off a bit once the tour reached Florida however I am hoping that a trip to his adopted home state of Texas will reignite things.
BEAU HOSSLER  ->  positive

Stay away from Chuckles this week and thank me later. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Sullivan t-70th)    Morgan Hoffmann– No, I didn’t flip flop these Hoffman(n)s around on accident. Morgan missed the cut here each of the past two years and finished t-52nd in ’13, which is certainly nothing to write home about.
Morgan Hoffmann–  ->  positive

The Aussie is killing it off the tee, sticking his irons, chipping well and, as usual, missing more 3-foot putts than everyone else combined. Classic Adam Scott. He’s lost almost three strokes per start over his last three events, yet he has churned out solid finishes since the Tour moved to the East Coast (T13/T16).
Adam Scott.  ->  positive

In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

Puerto Rico Open 🔥 takes: - Uihlein picks up the win - Varner with a top ten - Power with a top 20 - Flores with a top 25
Flores  ->  positive

Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour. Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar.
Emiliano Grillo  ->  positive

As of now the worst weather over the first two days might actually be on Thursday morning but that can change in an instant obviously so make sure you re-check it Wednesday night before submitting your lineups. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($11,900): Arguments could be made for and against rostering all of the top four priced players this week on DraftKings but of the four Fowler stacks up the best for me. Since 2012 Rickie has made 5/5 cuts at PGA National and in 20 rounds has gone 69 or better ten times—and only shot worse than 72 twice in that span.
Rickie  ->  positive

Cink has missed two cuts in a row and is 44, and Glover has poor history at PGA National, but they’re definitely underpriced relative to their talent. Two other guys who stand out in the $7,000 range are Charles Howell and Russell Henley. Howell is the perfect cash-game play: Of golfers with at least 25 tournaments over the past year, he ranks third with an 83 percent Consistency Rating.
Russell Henley.  ->  positive

playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
ROSE  ->  positive

We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic. These unknown greens in Mexico will result in tough 5 – 7 footers and patience will help.
Hatton  ->  negative

Here are my picks for the 2017 U.S. Open. Jordan Spieth 16/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds. WilliamHill 6 places 1/5 odds) 2pts e/w:  Jordan Spieth has not had his best season so far, but the fact we are saying that is a testament to the lofty expectations placed on him by both us and himself.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He’s 7th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green, over the past 24 rounds. Jon Rahm ($10,800) has scored the most DK Points over his past 24 rounds. He’s 1st in Strokes Gained: Total and 2nd in Strokes Gained: Approach in that time frame.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

When he catches some form, there’s a good chance he will keep it going for a while, so a good week here will certainly bode well ahead of the Masters in three weeks’ time. Fitzpatrick is first out on the 10th tee on Thursday, playing with Brandon Harkins and former winner of this event, Robert Gamez so he will get the best of the greens, making him an intriguing option as First Round Leader, an honour he shared with Emiliano Grillo last season. Tom Jacobs – Sam Horsfield to finish inside the top-20 (8/1)  Still just 21, it feels like Sam Horsfield’s name has been bounded around forever but that is because Ian Poulter has been gushing about the young Englishman’s ability for years.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Don't forget he was 5th at the Open Championship and 10th at the Baltusrol-hosted PGA Championship in 2016 and I like his competitive streak whereby he isn't intimidated in the biggest tournaments. Great results across both Emirates Golf Club - 8th (2016), 3rd (2017) and 3rd (2018) and Crans-sur-Sierre - 3rd (2014), 3rd (2015) and 3rd (2017) tie in well with the last 2 winners here in Garcia and Willett, but I also like Hatton for his strong links with St Andrews as Augusta winners Tiger Woods, Zach Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia all have excellent records at the Home of Golf, as does 2016 champion Danny Willett. So getting on board the 2016 and 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links winner Hatton makes lots of sense to me at a rather tasty price.
Hatton  ->  positive

The FedEx Cup itself has been won by the Tour Championship tournament winner here every time since 2010. Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Billy Horschel, Henrik Stenson and Brandt Snedeker were all in the top 6 of the FEC standings across the last 5 renewals whilst Bill Haas and Jim Furyk were in positions 25 and 11 respectively in the 2 years prior to that. 12 months ago, Rory McIlroy was he first FEC winner since Bill Haas to not control his own destiny when arriving in Atlanta.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Winning machine Thomas hit the ball beautifully at Augusta last time, was 12th here in 2015, and also finished fifth on the Web.com Tour on his only other start in Louisiana. You can rest assured both these Alabama graduates will have plenty of support from the Crimson Tide and it’s also of some significance that they play a similar ball – Cauley the Pro V1, Thomas the Pro V1 X – although they’re hardly unique on that front. Even so, Thomas currently leads the PGA Tour in birdie average and alongside an in-form partner looks overpriced in what should develop into a real shootout.
Cauley  ->  positive

Louis Oosthuizen 60/1 (BetBright 1-6 1/4 odds) 1pt e/w:  Louis Oosthuizen has always been considered a major player, and already has an Open Championship on his CV, which he almost added to, two years ago. Oosthuizen won the 2010 Open Championship at St.Andrews by 7 strokes and five years later, nearly won it again at the very same course. Oosthuizen made it into the three-man play-off at the 2015 Open, but was beaten by Zach Johnson.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

He also ranks inside the Top 10 in SG: Putting this season and if he can avoid the double bogey's that cost him the win last week, he has a great shot at winning a Green Jacket. Hideki Matsuyama  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,900)  FanDuel ($9,700)  If you are looking to go ultra-contrarian in the top tier this week just roster Jason Day. He should be extremely low owned but comes with a lot of risk as we just don't know where his head is at.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

I’ll be on at 16s. The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

His play at the Match Play had a disappointing result (T52), but he rates out very well for Augusta:  2 nd in SG: Off the Tee (1.036)  in SG: Off the Tee (1.036) 2 nd in Driving Distance (All Drives), 312.0 yards  in Driving Distance (All Drives), 312.0 yards 13 th in Putts per Round – although he’s three-putted 17 times (3.37%)  in Putts per Round – although he’s three-putted 17 times (3.37%) 2 nd in overall Birdie or Better percentage, 28.17%  in overall Birdie or Better percentage, 28.17% T4 in Par-4 Scoring, T34 in Par-5 Scoring  Much like Bubba, Rahm’s a long hitter that tends to be inaccurate with the driver, and for a golfer that’s seemingly got horrific SG: Approach numbers (137th on Tour, losing 0.161 strokes), Rahm is still hitting 69.05% of greens in regulation. Over his last 24 measured rounds, Rahm is the 16th-best putter in the field on bentgrass, compared to 31st on Bermuda, which is another notch in his belt for the speedy greens of Augusta National. Other golfers to consider: Justin Rose ($9300) – chalk, chalk, chalk; Dustin Johnson ($11400) – poor year by his standards but expected low-ownership for the current number one is hard to pass up.
Rahm’s  ->  positive

While the field this week is strong, I think this is still a great spot for Cauley to potentially pick up his first win – or at the very least another top finish. In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging. Last year Cauley shot his best round ever here with a 66 in the third round and also ranked number one in Par 5 Scoring for the week, which shows an increasing level of comfort with the venue.
Cauley  ->  positive

He's 19th for Birdie Average. Last four events: 7-MC-4-9  Course form: 36-13-8-MC-63-MC-30-17-14-22  Florida form: MC-36-WD-MC-13-53-17-48-8-58-46-8  Last 50 starts - Win: 4%, Top 5: 16%, Top 10: 30%    Paul Casey  "It's a golf course I love," said Casey when speaking about Bay Hill last year. "I've not necessarily had great results here in the past but I think that the conditions suit my game.
Casey  ->  positive

But other than Dustin Johnson four years ago, the champions have been of standard length -- or in the case of Zach Johnson in 2014 and Steve Stricker in 2012, even sub-standard. Last year, Jordan Spieth rolled to an eight-stroke victory over Patrick Reed despite being only T17 in driving distance. He won by masterfully playing the angles of the course, not to mention leading the field in strokes gained putting and finishing third in both scrambling and proximity to the hole (the greens are enormous, and simply doing well at GIR won't cut it).
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

In the stats of importance this week, Steele ranks 20th in Greens in Regulation, T22 in Par-4 Performance and T34 in Par-4 Scoring Average this season. In addition, Steele ranks 15th in the All-Around Ranking. Steele has only won twice on the PGA Tour, his first win coming back in 2011, so it may be difficult to see him winning twice in one season when it took him six years just to add to his maiden victory.
Steele  ->  positive

No wonder therefore that experienced players, with a liking for tight par 70s, tend to thrive here. Short game specialists (Jordan Spieth, Chris Kirk and Zach Johnson) and ball-strikers (Adam Scott and Boo Weekley) have an equal chance of victory on this classical Colonial layout. Jordan Spieth and Chris Kirk scrambled and putted their way to victory; prior to that Adam Scott (2014) and Boo Weekley (2013) had diligently plotted their way around the par 70, both ranking in the top-10 for Driving Accuracy and Greens in Regulation.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Bill Haas  World Golf Ranking (#41)  Vegas Odds (35/1  Draftkings ($9,500)  FanDuel ($8,500)  As expected, Haas is currently #2 on the FanShareSports most tagged list as he is one of the other three golfers with local knowledge being a member here. Haas has been a bit more consistent this season with seven Top 25 finishes but the form is almost identical after missing the cut in a big way(71/76) at the RBC Heritage. I prefer Haas over Webb this week due to a few stats.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Sure, players will have one more opportunity to fine tune their games next week at the St. Jude Classic, but you’re not getting the same quality of field. I guarantee the galleries in Memphis won’t be seeing six of the world’s Top 10 – Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, and Adam Scott – or another hefty dose of the Top 25: Justin Rose (Rose has decided to skip the event), Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar, Charl Schwartzel, Brooks Koepka, Kevin Kisner, and Phil Mickelson. If St. Jude can draw a fourth of those names, I shall be stunned.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Perhaps the hangover ends this week. Paul Casey - $10,200    Casey does not have the greatest recent form here -- T43 two years ago, missed cut the year before -- but this is a course that should suit him, and he's certainly more on his game than he was in 2014-15. Like Garcia he's a sub-optimal putter, but Casey ranks seventh in both ball striking and P4P, 12th in SGT2G and T25 in proximity.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

Although he did not look great last week at WGC Mexico I am not overly concerned as this course fits his style much more than what we saw last weekend. Charl Schwartzel – All Formats – DK: $7500 FD: $9800  Although Schwartzel has not seen his name atop a leaderboard in a while he has quietly been making plenty of cuts and has a great history here at Valspar. In the last two years Scwhartzel has finished T6 and won the event in 2016.
Charl Schwartzel  ->  positive

He’s been consistently good since missing the cut at the PGA Championship in August. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Turning it around a bit to start the new season, but he struggled enough toward the end of last year that we can’t justify the $9,800 price tag here.
Hideki Matsuyama.  ->  negative

I personally will be splitting them in my GPP lineups but if you are looking to go contrarian you will get Rory McIlroy and Alex Noren at a big ownership discount this week. I would lean McIlroy who has been a good wind player over the years and also has a bit of course history as he finished 2nd here back in 2014. He also bounced back from a missed cut at Pebble Beach with a T20 at the Genesis so you could say he is trending in the right direction.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

$8million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive: Jamie Lovemark has to be positive this week at $9.6 million. A lover of soft, scorable golf courses, he was 6th here last term - going out in the final group with Dufner and Hadwin. Lovemark seems the sort, who struggles to get over the line, but undoubtedly he strings form together well and he's 15th for Total Birdies season to date, after hitting another 2 eagles and 18 birdies at Waialae.
Hadwin.  ->  positive

He is probably too risky for cash games but is an excellent, high upside GPP play. Who the Stat Like  Tony Finau  World Golf Ranking (#74)  Vegas Odds (35/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,100)  I already talked about Hadwin and Steel who rank #1 and #3 in my overall model so we will jump right to the guy in the middle of them, Tony Finau. Looking at the field ranks for this week, Finau is 1st in SG: OTT, 2nd in SG: OTT + APP, 5th in Driving Distance, 4th in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd and 14th in GIR from 175-200 and 200+ and 15th in both Bogey Avoidance and Birdie or Better %.
Finau  ->  positive

He comes to the fore on mid-score (-11 to -17) level tournaments and at 7th in the Team USA Ryder Cup standings, a win this week would pretty much lock his place on the flight to Paris in September - which on form over the last 10 months you have to say he merits. RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them.

The reason I struggle to pick him is the price. Pat Perez has won twice on the PGA Tour in 380 starts. This isn’t an impressive ratio, and given it was seven years between his two victories, Perez seems difficult to rely on.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
Kirk's  ->  positive

-- Kevin Maguire  Chad Campbell  Not only is Campbell playing his best golf of the season, making four of five cuts including a T-13 at the AT&T Byron Nelson, T-10 at the St. Jude Classic and a T-9 last week at Greenbrier, he also has a history of playing well at this event. In fact, Campbell has made the cut in each of his past five appearances at the John Deere Classic. -- Joe Kaiser  DraftKings value picks  Kelly Kraft  I may be a week late on Kraft as he jumped up the leaderboard last week, but I'm thinking that the putting could still get better than it was last week (where he was putrid on the greens).
Campbell  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

It's also worth remembering that this is only the third time that the Texas Open has been played 2 weeks after The Masters. Looking at the past 7 winners in this post-Augusta slot, Bohn (80/1), Horschel (33/1), Noh (125/1) and Rose (11/1) won at TPC Louisiana; Snedeker (35/1) at Harbour Town and Ben Curtis (150/1), Charley Hoffman (30/1) and Kevin Chappell (33/1) here at TPC San Antonio. As you'd expect a mix of players and circumstances across 3 different courses, but all had at least a top 16 finish in one of their previous 2 outings which differs significantly from the incoming form characteristics if you look purely at the Valero Open winners.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Paul Casey – GPP – DK:$9400 FD: $11600  Definitely check back into our SlackChat as this thought could change but I think looking at pricing Paul Casey could come in very under-owned and give you a top-end talent playing well with low ownership. Casey’s price makes him tough to roster if going for any of the top end guys and I think it is much easier when constructing rosters to spend less on Cantlay, Kucher or Perez. Casey is still playing good golf as he showed with his T9 finish a few weeks ago at Abu Dhabi and although he has no course history he has shown over the years his ability to adapt to new courses.
Casey  ->  positive

His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day. Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.
Chappell  ->  positive

The dude hits his 3-wood straight as an arrow and as long as most pros hit their driver. Stenson should have no issue navigating these tight holes, raking up greens in regulation and filling the cup with plenty of birdies. Oh, his worst finish in his last six starts….T9.
Stenson  ->  positive

He's played just twice since November but finished 9th in Abu Dhabi in mid-January and 8th last week at Pebble Beach. Casey is a stellar tee-to-green player and can get the irons going as well as pretty much anyone. Phil Mickelson ($11,300 | 22) - Mickelson is a two-time winner here (2008 and 2009) and has a pair of seconds in 2007 and 2012.
Casey  ->  positive

It won’t surprise me one bit to see Martin use his world-class tee two green game to propel himself to a top 20 finish this week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7.9K) – In this outing, the South African makes his season debut and looks for his elusive first win stateside. Louis Oosthuizen played well here last year.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.
Bubba  ->  negative

Koepka is 20th in strokes gained: off the tee in this field and is 8th in strokes gained: approach at this course (among 50 golfers with course history in the past five years) in his four rounds. Rickie Fowler ($9,000 | 18/1) - Rickie always has big ownership, but it's justified because he either fits the course well or is playing well or has played at that particular course well. Fowler has finished top-10 (10th, 10th, 8th) in the past three years at this event and was 2nd back in 2011.
Rickie  ->  positive

Paul Casey - $10,200    Casey does not have the greatest recent form here -- T43 two years ago, missed cut the year before -- but this is a course that should suit him, and he's certainly more on his game than he was in 2014-15. Like Garcia he's a sub-optimal putter, but Casey ranks seventh in both ball striking and P4P, 12th in SGT2G and T25 in proximity. Matt Kuchar - $10,100    The ultimate safety-net pick.
Casey  ->  positive

He’s a riskier play as he enters the week in terrible form, but as Si Woo Kim and Billy Horschel have shown recently, form is not the be all and end all. On the year, Reavie’s had some fantastic finishes including a T8 in the strong Sony Open field, but no Top-25s since January will help keep him slide under the radar. Reavie is another shorter hitter that’s deadly accurate (11th in Accuracy %) which has led him to a great Par-4 Scoring rank of 32nd (4.01) – he’s also great on Par-3s at 18th (3.00) but will struggle on the par-5s because of that lack of distance.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

This contest has a large number of entries, with guaranteed prize payouts, which means we can't play it safe if we want to see our name at the top! DraftKings Picks:    Rory McIlroy ($11,100): He's still one of the best at racking up birdies (and eagles) in bunches when he's on his game. I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
Cook  ->  positive

He has above-average putting numbers across the board, performs better on par-3s and -4s (he struggles on par-5s due to the distance), but has also never made the cut here and will be a high-risk/high-reward play thanks to expected low ownership. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card.

The win is Kizzire’s second win of the young 2017-18 golf season and it boosted his standing in the World Golf Rankings. Less than three months ago, Kizzire was ranked outside of the Top 300; he is now number 54 in the world.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Smith knows how to dial it back off the tee as well as avoid bogeys when missing the fairway, which is so important at a course such as Copperhead. In his 28 measured rounds this year, Smith has made bogey on only 11.5 percent of his holes (T-5). Smith is also 8-under on 43 attempts from outside 200 yards, 2-under from the rough (T-18) and great at both one-putting and scoring in general.
Smith  ->  positive

I'm e/w on McGirt, Molinari &amp; Gay (long shot) in Wells Fargo this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
Molinari  ->  positive

He came T7 here last season after his T17 finish in his debut. Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds.
Chappell  ->  positive

Spieth will be playing this course for the first time which is a scary proposition at his price point, which could help keep ownership slightly lower than it should be. The concerns with Spieth have typically come in just one area, Off the Tee, but he’s an absolute stud in every other facet of golf – he leads the Tour in SG: Approach, is 40th in SG: Putting (but 3rd in Putting Average), and 40th in SG: Around the Green. The Off the Tee numbers aren’t nearly as terrifying as they would be otherwise, because his lack of distance (291.6) and struggles with accuracy (59.35%) will be mitigated by the way the course sets up.
Spieth  ->  positive

Fowler also happens to be a great putter, but great putting has not been a requirement for winning at PGA National. That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week.

After a very exciting US Open – that played much easier than expected thanks to the width of the fairways which I completely under-rated – the Tour stops in Connecticut for the Traveler’s Championship, with a remarkably packed field. Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy are some of the highlights at the top of the field, but there are plenty of good options in the value range as well. The Course  The Traveler’s Championship is played at TPC River Highlands, a Pete Dye design, which means it shares some common characteristics with the other Dye-designed courses (RBC Heritage, The Players, etc.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

I’m leaning bombers, but if you’re going to side with a shorter hitter this week, place an emphasis on approach, short game and look for them to end up inside the top 20 for the event in putting. Since putting has the most variance hole-to-hole, the safer option is to load up on the deeper drivers and birdie makers as overall strategy  2018 Waste Management Open Picks — Targets From Each Range  Hideki Matsuyama  The Hideki-Bot got a grain of sand stuck in his motherboard Saturday at the Farmers and things went sideways quickly. Still, he got his game righted Sunday, and enters as the back-to-back in Phoenix, with no finish worse than T4 in his four career starts at this event.
Hideki  ->  positive

He has played well around Waialae in the past finishing 20,13,13 in his last three starts. Harman looks to be a good fit for this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, fourth in GIR, 22nd in SGTTG and 11th in SG Putting. With a decent record here and excellent current form Harman looks worth backing here this week.
Harman  ->  positive

Scott has two top-10 finishes in his last three tournaments, and he is tied for seventh with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Per our DFS Ownership Dashboard, Dufner was nice and chalky with his 21.18 percent average ownership last week when he missed the cut. This is a good week to capitalize on some recency bias, as Dufner made nine straight cuts prior to last week.
Dufner:  ->  positive

I think these are the type of weeks when the cream rises to the top. For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico.
McIlroy.  ->  positive

I can forgive him that. Looking at the breakdown of his stats, it has to be significant that Fowler was ranked 1st for Putts taken in both 2013 and 2014 after needing just 108 swishes of the blade each time. He was double digits under par (-10) on the par 5s in both 2013 and 2015 so he can really attack the long holes so it's just a question of limiting the mistakes.
Fowler  ->  positive

Scott won The PLAYERS all the way back in 2004 and hasn’t missed a cut in his last five tries. We are all well aware of Scott’s ball striking ability that can put him in contention week after week. It is just a matter of if his putter will show up or not.

Marc Leishman  ->  positive

Given how well the frontrunners fare, picking out the winner after the opening round should prove far easier than finding him before the off but I have thrown a few pounds at three big outsiders. Last year's Sony winner, Fabian Gomez, who finished sixth on debut here 12 months ago, looks worth chancing at a triple-figure price and I quite like Aaron Baddeley and Vaughn Taylor too. Baddeley ranked fifth for Scrambling on the PGA Tour last year and he finished fourth at the Australian Open last time out and Taylor finished eighth and fourth here, in 2005 and 2006, on his only two previous appearances.
Aaron Baddeley  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside. Keegan was fourth in Strokes Gained: Approach at the Farmers, trailing only Goosen, Noren and Hadley.
Bradley  ->  positive

Russel Knox ($8,200) – Knox is just another golfer with supreme talent who is priced down in a big way. At $8,200, Russell Knox is one of my favorite plays this week. He ranked 8th in Driving Accuracy Percentage and 9th in Greens in Regulation Percentage in 2016.
Knox  ->  positive

This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
Blayne Barber  ->  positive

Whilst I suspect many of the faces will be solid in their top-10 efforts there is ample opportunity to make a profit from the less-fancied and/or under-rated types and we will go for a  Top of my list is the improving Kiradech Aphibarnrat, who has risen 85 places on the world rankings from 2014-2017 and has taken a further leap up to 29th after making the quarter-finals of the WGC Matchplay at the end of March. Just looking at his more recent form, the 29-year-old finished 6th in Turkey to Justin Rose (joint-leader into Sunday), runner-up to Jon Rahm at the DP Championship, 5th to Rose (again) in Indonesia and 5th to Mickelson and Thomas in the WGC Mexico, all winners being very highly fancied at Augusta this week.

He’s a tee-to-green behemoth with the ability to dominate this golf course as he has so many others. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – So he shot an 80 at Riviera on a tough, windy day. That shouldn’t make him $1,800 cheaper than DJ.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

In three appearances at Memorial, Cauley doesn’t have any finishes better than 34th but three made cuts is at least encouraging. Last year Cauley shot his best round ever here with a 66 in the third round and also ranked number one in Par 5 Scoring for the week, which shows an increasing level of comfort with the venue. Cauley ranks 10th on tour in approaches this season and he’s also had success on other Jack Nicklaus designed courses in 2017, with a T3 at the Career Builder and a solid week at the Honda Classic.
Cauley  ->  positive

I hope it will be there at Augusta." There is also a flip-side to Matsuyama's low-key preparation. He goes into every major with the weight of a nation on his shoulders, with more media following him than probably every player here bar Tiger, and that has to have affected him from time to time.
Matsuyama's  ->  positive

Priced at only $7,800, he offers a ton of upside for GPP contests. Zach Turcotte: Luke Donald ($7,600)  The tour moves to Florida this week and with that, a lot of players will be headed back home, one being Luke Donald. Donald, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, has been very successful at PGA National over the years.

Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts. Marc Leishman, $8300 – Leishman broke through for his first PGA Tour win here in 2012, and has since blossomed into a multiple-tournament winner on Tour with a few close calls in major championships.

Dave Tindall previews the 81st Masters at Augusta National...  Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 6 places        I've thought long and hard about this over the last few weeks and I've finally come to the conclusion that Dustin Johnson will win the 81st Masters at Augusta National - and possibly by some distance. When DJ starts breaking Tiger's records, you have to realise that he is a very, very special talent. And although the game is littered with top-class players right now, DJ is the one who will head to Augusta National in the form of his life.

DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $12,000 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 8-1)    Fowler is the overwhelming favorite this week, and while we list him here, we're not sure he will make our six-man lineup (if you enter lots of lineups, that's a different story). Fowler has had a lot of time to think about missing a prime chance at the U.S. Open, and we should see where his head is at first thing on Thursday. That said, Fowler checks off all the boxes: 11th in SG: Tee-to-Green, seventh in SG: Putting and first in scrambling.
Fowler  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley - $14,500    Having finished his 2016-17 campaign at No. 2 on Tour in GIR percentage and 11th in SG: Tee-to-Green, Stanley’s price this week creates intriguing value as one of the field’s top ball strikers. He’s coming off a T10 at the Sony Open and has placed top-25 at the Farmers Insurance Open in back-to-back years.

Selections    I toyed with backing Ryan Moore, in the hope that he can get the flat-stick working, but the price has gone now so I'm happy to leave him out This is a very tough tournament and I was tempted to lay the front end of the market (apart from Moore) before the off and see where that took me but in the end I've decided to kick the event off with some very small wagers on three outsiders. Cheeson Hadley and Trey Mullinax have both won the Web.com Tour's Rex Hospital Open in Raleigh (about an hour away) and both rank fairly highly for Greens In Regulation. Hadley, who lives in Raleigh, has been in fair form this year - he won on the Web.com Tour last month and he was third last week so he could go well and Mullinax is ranked 132nd in the FedEx Cup Standings so that could be a pointer.
Hadley  ->  positive

Other tournament targets to consider include: Alex Noren ($7,900), Sergio Garcia ($9,400), Peter Uihlein ($7,000), Patrick Cantlay ($6,900) and Jhonattan Vegas ($6,500). MY PICK : Paul Casey ($7,800)  Outside of a couple of obvious picks at the top (Rory and Spieth), one of the players with the best chance at picking up the win this week in my mind is Paul Casey. The Englishman has not done the best job of capitalizing on his opportunities the past couple of years, but he’s continued to put himself in the mix week after week this season and has now recorded eight straight finishes of 26th or better coming into the final major (including a T5 from last week).
Paul Casey  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Cameron Tringale ($6,700)  Tringale is a hard player to get right, but he always brings upside for DFS. Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead.
Tringale  ->  positive

The Texas resident posted ten Top 15's that season and closed out the year with a runner-up finish in the TOUR Championship at East Lake. In 2014 rounds of 67-68-66-68 seen Lee finish second to Chesson Hadley in the Puerto Rico Open, it's worth noting he led the field with 28 birdies for the week. The South Korea native is good friends with Rickie Fowler and it comes as no surprise to me that his return to form has come on the back of the American claiming his fourth PGA Tour title at The Honda Classic.
Lee  ->  positive

Comfortable on these poa annua greens, I can see him continuing the momentum this week at a nice price. RESULT: T35  James Hahn 1pt EW 80/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds):  I like the look of James Hahn this week who's been playing some great stuff on the West Coast and who has course form to boot. A player who can blow ice-cold, finding season-long statistics to back up any thoughts on him is nigh on impossible, but despite 3 relative poor outings in the autumn Hahn still ranks 49th for Birdie or Better Conversion, 29th for Strokes Gained Approach and 46th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green.
Hahn  ->  positive

RUSSELL KNOX – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 25th  My second ‘Ball Striker’ who played well last week is Russell Knox. Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox!

We know that Deere Run is a specialised test where players often churn out regular contending performances, so it's interesting to note the detail behind Danny's last visit here in 2015. Fresh off of a victory at the Greenbrier Classic the Sunday before, Lee was grouped with Jordan Spieth pretty much throughout the whole tournament. Rounds of 68-68-62 (a career low) got the Texas-based 26-year-old into the Final Group with Spieth and going down the last Danny and Jordan were level with the clubhouse leader Tom Gillis.
Danny's  ->  positive

Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
PATRICK REED  ->  positive

With the front two in the betting there to be taken on, suddenly this feels like an eminently winnable event. So many of the course specialists are either out of form or out of town and while the case for Marc Leishman is solid, as it is for Brian Harman, I'm not sure either can match Kisner who has the added benefit of being a bigger price. For starters, of the three he's still the one I'd rather have batting for me on the 72nd hole of a tightly-contested event.
Brian Harman,  ->  positive

You really need to do everything well to score around here," he said two years ago so finishing second (BMW) and fourth (Dell Technologies) on the All-Around in the last two FedEx Cup Playoff events shows his game is in ideal shape to make an impression. Those two second places at East Lake add to a pair of runners-up finishes at nearby Augusta National so playing Rose 'without Spieth' makes extra sense given that he's been the nearly man so many times in Georgia. It's stating the obvious to say that Spieth would out-putt him if the two were locked together coming down the stretch so I'm convinced this is the best market for Rose this week.
Rose  ->  positive

With the U.S. Open nearing and a Muirfield Village course that he likes ahead this week, a fourth win of the season is on tap. Johnson finished third at the Memorial last year prior to his U.S. Open triumph at Oakmont.-- Bob Harig  Value picks  Kevin Tway  I think a lot of people will shy away from Tway in this field, but I don't think that's the route we should go. When looking at his past three performances (not finishing places) he's gaining over a stroke from tee-to-green as well as gaining almost a stroke on the greens.

No one that has played 29 rounds or more ranks higher than Spaun in Proximity to the Hole and only Charles Howell III and Patton Kizzire, both of whom rank 24th, have played 29 rounds or more (both have played 30) and rank higher than Spaun in Greens in Regulation, so it is fair to say he is striking the ball wonderfully. Kizzire is also the only player to have played 29 rounds or more and rank higher than Spaun in Par 4 Scoring Average, so this test looks to be right up Spaun’s alley this week. His T4 finish here 12 months ago was one of four top-10’s Spaun posted in 2017, with two of them coming at the start of this wrap-around season.
Spaun  ->  positive

Bryson DeChambeau 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds, Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5 pt e/w:  Somewhat an enigma, you are never quite sure what DeChambeau is going to turn up but I am hoping the best one turns up here at Copperhead. Thru 36 holes here last year, DeChambeau was sitting in T8, following opening rounds of 67-70. Rounds of 72-73 halted any progress over the weekend however, dropping into a tie for 27th.
DeChambeau  ->  positive

You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Matt Kuchar, Kevin Chappell, Charley Hoffman, Sergio Garcia, Brendan Steele, Zach Johnson, Ryan Palmer, Luke List, Jason Kokrak, and Chesson Hadley. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
Chesson Hadley.  ->  positive

Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
Spieth  ->  positive

He hits a lot of fairways and greens, which is the key to contending at the British Open. Fade: Jason Day. The former World No.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

Henrik Stenson has burned DFS players in his last two outings but carries a 69.6 scoring average at this tournament over his last three visits. I also like Rickie Fowler who has figured this course out recently with two top-10s here over the past three years. Australians have a nice record at this event and Adam Scott (a former winner) could go overlooked due to his lack of play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

But for many U.S.-based golf and fantasy golf fans, the Hero serves as the de facto year-ender. Key Stats to Winning at Kapalua (in order of importance)    • Putting average/strokes gained putting  • Proximity to the hole/strokes gained approach  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Birdie or better percentage    Past Champions    2017 - Justin Thomas  2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy  2009 - Geoff Ogilvy  2008 - Daniel Chopra    Champion's Profile    When we look back at the eight winners this decade, some hit the ball far off the tee, some didn't. But they collectively excelled in their short game: proximity to the hole, scrambling and, especially, putting.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

6. Dustin Johnson, United States -- After posting five consecutive finishes in the top 10, including victories in the U.S. Open at Oakmont and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone, Johnson has not been as sharp in his last two outings. He missed the cut in the PGA Championship after opening with a 77 at Baltusrol, and tied for 18th last week in the Barclays to open the playoffs, breaking 70 only when he shot 67 in the third round.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

He ranks 63 in SG: OTT and 68th in SG: APP but ranks 10th in Par 5 Scoring and 4th in Scrambling. Due to the separation in stats from other golfers in the range I will be using Reed in GPP's only this week. Also Consider - Jason Day  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 40/1  Draftkings - $8,600  FantasyAces - $5,550    Value play of the week!!
Reed  ->  positive

That’s strange behavior from someone who hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in Strokes Gained: Putting in each of the last two years (12th in 2016; 18th in 2017). Normally with Hadwin, it’s “I really hope his tee-to-green game can catch up to his putting.” Now, it’s the inverse. His lack of distance is worrisome, but he notched a T36 in his Augusta debut last year, and with some experience on these greens, plus an excellent track record at equally as lengthy Riviera (Hadwin gained the eighth-most strokes of any player in this field at the Genesis Open), pencil in Hadwin for the low, low price of $7,200 on DraftKings.
Hadwin,  ->  positive

16th (2011), 5th (2012), 14th (2014), 1st (2015) and 15th (2016) highlights a player who enjoys this classical set-up and 66/1 with Betfred seems a little out of kilter for a player who's a 40/1 shot with plenty of other bookmakers. Kirk has been putting well enough - 47th Strokes Gained Putting - this season and sits inside our Putting Average 10-week tracker top 13, so it was interesting to see that his TPC Sawgrass performance a fortnight ago was driven by a great all-round showing. 6th for Ball Striking, 5th for Greens in Regulation and 5th for Putting Average generated Kirk's best ever finish at TPC Sawgrass and he also shot a -3/69 in the windiest conditions on Saturday.
Kirk  ->  positive

-- Michael Collins  Adam Scott  It's been 10 years since Scott last played in Memphis, and the memory is not good as he blew the 54-hole lead with a final-round 75 -- and hasn't been back. But Scott is committed to playing the week ahead of majors this year and seems close to putting it together. -- Bob Harig  DraftKings value picks  Kevin Tway  Shooting 77-75 last week should be enough to get most of his backers to back off this week, especially with some more popular names around him this week.
Scott  ->  negative

Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Henrik Stenson; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Emiliano Grillo; 5) Ryan Moore; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Alex Cejka / Kyle Stanley; 9) Steve Stricker; 10) Martin Laird; 11) Matthew Fitzpatrick; 12) Chad Campbell; 13) Daniel Berger / Ian Poulter; 15) Ryan Blaum; 16) Sergio Garcia; 17) Tommy Fleetwood; 18) Rafa Cabrera Bello; 19) Kevin Kisner / Jon Rahm / Vaughn Taylor.

Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Close here last year, but he often goes under-owned when he shouldn’t. Sleeper of the week = Lee McCoy. Played great as an amateur here… but the real reason I like him is he has played the course over 1000 times growing up so close.
Lee McCoy.  ->  positive

#HeroWorldChallenge Picks Reed Berger Tiger😀 I also have a Fowler exotic (parlayed him w the Rams from Sunday)
Berger  ->  positive

He has good memories at Riviera, too, a T-4 in 2015 and also winning a team NCAA Championship in 2012. His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott.
Spieth  ->  positive

But I also like McGirt as his 69-68 across the weekend in Las Vegas was good enough for tied 5th in the field - level with Cantlay and Hadley - plus his CV contains plenty of excellent performances by the coast. A steady hand on the tiller might be just what's needed this week on the eastern seaboard and McGirt fits that bill perfectly. RESULT: T8  Beau Hossler 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
McGirt  ->  positive

That’s not asking too much. Aaron Wise  It’s time to jump on the former NCAA individual champion’s bandwagon before it’s overflowing with bodies. After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside.
Wise  ->  positive

The pick of them is Bill Haas, and while his overall play in majors is a nagging concern in that he's been consistently on the fringes but never in the mix, at three-figure prices there's a pretty compelling case to be made for him. For starters, Haas is in great form. His third-placed finish in the Match Play was a fine effort and came on the back of several others; it's no surprise that he's up with Fowler in the bogey avoidance (second) and scrambling (first) stats which should mean he can tackle Augusta's biggest challenge with confidence.
Haas,  ->  positive

An ranks 15th in SG:T2G and 57th in Par 4 Scoring. Tony Finau ($15,600) – My favorite risk/reward every week, especially on bentgrass greens, Finau will be sure to get your blood pressure going if you watch closely. He can also shoot lights out when everything is going right.
Finau  ->  positive

Back Vaughn Taylor 1u @ [500.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [30.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [3.0]  Given that Herman and Points were absolutely enormous upsets, don't be afraid to take a punt at a crazy price. Vaughn Taylor is every bit as realistic as either of those were. He even won an event last year.
Vaughn Taylor  ->  positive

Some players arrive at Augusta National fearing the worst, others are hopeful that they might do well and contend. Casey is very much in the bracket of player who thinks he can win. It's a feeling he's had since his debut in 2006 when he turned up at his first Masters and finished T6 after middle rounds of 69-68.
Casey  ->  positive

So the message is clear, when Rory’s tail is up and he is in confident mood keep him on side as he will more than likely follow up. JUSTIN THOMAS – 12-1 – 3pts Win Eliminated Semi Final  On a very similar theme to that of Rory this week I am keen to stick with the other ‘hot hand’ at the moment in the form of Justin Thomas. I pointed out when siding with JT in Mexico a couple of weeks ago that, with the exception of after his win at the CJ Cup, which basically signalled the end of his 2017 playing year, after each of his previous two wins he had either won again on his next start or the one after.
Justin Thomas.  ->  positive

Spieth has struggled off the tee this year, but leads the field in Strokes Gained: Approach and is 5th in Par 3 Birdie or Better so far this year. Most DraftKings players will have to make a decision between Spieth and Johnson. Spieth is the better cash game play this week in my opinion.
Spieth  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor.

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Coming off a T-7 finish at Valspar last week, his game and health are both in a good place for this week to end with him holding the trophy. Jonathan Coachman: Rory McIlroy ($12,000)  This week is special for many reasons. Yes, it's a golf tournament, but it's also a remembrance, a celebration.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas. That's some turnaround, especially as he led the field in greens hit last time out, and on balance has to be considered an overreaction.
Fowler  ->  positive

The prospects of Spieth appear better than any other player and he gets the vote to show it. There are only two others at the top of the market who make genuine appeal, despite the obvious claims of Fowler and Rahm in particular, and they're Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama ( 20/1 Sky Bet ). Scott's Open record is phenomenally good and, let's be honest, he should've won it two, maybe three times already.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts. With Adam, you can always take that his long game is going to be good, so for me, and I don’t know what the betting is, but if there’s value in the price of Adam Scott, that’s who I’d go with.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

Would be nice if I could see if I can fit Dufner Perez Kisner in every lineup this week.
Perez  ->  positive

Also like Kodaira, the No. 54-ranked Miyazato was in the Sony but MCed. He recently tied for 11th in a tournament in Australia co-sponsored by the European Tour and won by Kiradech Aphibarnrat.
Miyazato  ->  positive

Path to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Rory McIlroy: Round 1: 7th, Round 2: 5th, Round 3: 3rd. 2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 5th, Round 2: 2nd, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Billy Horschel: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 1st.
Jordan Spieth:  ->  positive

If he can just roll it at an average pace, like he did at this track last year, the reigning Masters champ will be near the top of the leaderboard. Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly.
Tony Finau  ->  positive

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Bob Harig -- Jon Rahm ($10,700)  The former Arizona State golfer has made the most of his short time as a professional, earning a spot on the PGA Tour this season by finishing among the top 125 in Fedex points despite not being a PGA Tour member. He's started this season with ties for 15th in both of his starts, including last week in Las Vegas.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Time waits for no man and all that, but in an event he's won twice and never failed to make Sunday, I rate Mickelson's chances better than in-form Brian Harman, as well as former winner Patrick Reed and the rest. Despite the changes to the rotation, birdie average has remained a key pointer over the last couple of years - eight of the top 10 in 2016 ended that year inside the Tour's top 25% - and Mickelson has been a consistent feature throughout his career, including the years subsequent to his Open victory. The absence since October must be something of a concern given that we're talking about a 47-year-old but almost half of his 44 PGA Tour wins have come prior to Augusta and, as mentioned, it looks like the left-handed magician has done much more in the off-season than has been the case in recent years.
Mickelson's  ->  positive

The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Kevin Na ($8400): Na has a pretty sparkling course history here, with a T4 last year, T8 in 2012, and T9 in 2011 being his most recent successes (he missed the cut in 2014). Unfortunately, Na is not the same player he’s been in the past, and it’s shown this season with three straight missed cuts and only two top-10s in cut events.
Na  ->  negative

Looking at my sheet, he ranks 8th in Strokes Gained: Approach, 18th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, 12th in Proximity from 125-150 Yards, 27th in Par 5 Scoring, and 12th in Birdie or Better %. Who is being Mentioned on FanShareSports(DraftKings)  $10K+ Range  Dustin Johnson and Jason Day lead the way in tags in the upper tier and will be two of the top owned golfers in almost every format thanks to all the values in the bottom tier. I have no problem going overweight on them and feel we can find some lower owned pivots from the obvious chalk plays in the bottom tiers to separate ourselves.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

To put that number in perspective: Only 10 players in the upcoming field at The Masters have an Adjusted PPR of 28.5 or lower and three of them — Fred Couples, amateur Curtis Luck, and Yuta Ikeda — are not regular PGA Tour Players. The 2007 Masters Champion Zach Johnson, once said “You just have to be on your toes on every single putt you ever have in the Masters.” Spieth’s elite putting ability gives him an edge at Augusta. Spieth’s 17.1 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is also elite and gives him extra value, given the DraftKings scoring system.
Spieth’s  ->  positive

Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Approaches 125-150 yards, Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Putting (Bermuda grass), Scrambling. Top-Tier Plays  Zach Johnson ($10,200)  Johnson, although not very long off the tee, still ranked 60th in Par 5 scoring last year. During his Masters win in 2007, you might recall that he laid up on every single Par 5 while shooting 11 under on them for the week, which bested Tiger Woods by two strokes.
Johnson  ->  positive

Fire him up at $7,000. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year.
Castro:  ->  positive

All in all, a share of 34th was by no means a disaster and it was encouraging to see him so sharp around the greens. Of course, winning twice in three starts is not easy, but Horschel went 2-1-1 on his way to FedEx Cup glory almost three years ago and even when needing time to adjust to his breakthrough win in 2013, just a handful of starts later was seen finishing fourth in the US Open. He's definitely a confidence player and when on-song there are few more reliable from tee-to-green, which is why he's compiled a strong record here, making the cut in all three visits, twice finishing inside the top 15, and even when down the field on debut finishing T2 for birdies.
Horschel  ->  positive

1pt each-way Rickie Fowler at 14/1 Sky Bet (10 places; 1/5 odds) Ranked first on the PGA Tour for adjusted scoring average his price deserves to be up amongst the likes of Spieth, McIlroy and Rahm. Winner of the Honda Classic in February, he’s played well almost the entire season including consecutive top-5 finishes on his last two starts in the United States.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Brian Harman, $11,300 – Despite a huge increase in salary compared to last week, Harman still shakes out as a good value on a course tailor made for his game. Harman has finished no worse than T20 in the past three years, so expect the lefty precision player to convert plenty of birdies and continue his good form. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Gary Woodland, $10,200 – Not typically who you’d think of at a venue like Waialae, Woodland has finished 6th, 13th and third his past three trips.
Harman,  ->  positive

He finished with a T18 at another less-than-driver event -- the Valspar Championship -- in which he shot -8 on the par 5's, which is something he'll need to duplicate this week if he's going to collect a big paycheck come Sunday. Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event.
Brown's  ->  positive

I have noticed that guys can go either one of two ways when they take some time off, either really bad or really good. Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years.
Day  ->  positive

Glover has an even better score of 69.3, and he’s only $7,200. Cink has missed two cuts in a row and is 44, and Glover has poor history at PGA National, but they’re definitely underpriced relative to their talent. Two other guys who stand out in the $7,000 range are Charles Howell and Russell Henley.
Glover  ->  positive

What better place than D.C. for Captain America to get his first win of the season? Bill Haas (DK: $9,500, FD: $8,400)    A difficult course with a weak field is a prime spot for Haas to pop. Haas is a Pete Dye specialist, and I’ve heard some golfers say that TPC Potomac has a lot of qualities that you would find at a Pete Dye course.
Haas  ->  positive

The slower/softer greens here should help and he’s simply too cheap for his talent level. Zac Blair ($6,400): Blair brings consistency this week and a lot of good play at corollary courses. He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico.
Zac Blair  ->  positive

5 PGA Tour victories for Moore shows that he can get the job done on his given day and undoubtedly Ryan will be motivated to keep the recent momentum going as at 71st in the OWGR he needs a strong performance to get a spot in the Dell World Match Play. Moore topped Greens in Regulation at a windswept PGA National 2 weeks ago and was 4th for Strokes Gained Putting at Riviera the week before that where he finished 8th. Ryan shot -3/68 across Thursday/Friday to be 3rd at 36 holes, so he's clearly playing some nice stuff as 14th for Scoring Average, 35th for Bogey Avoidance, 9th for Scrambling from the Rough and 33rd for Strokes Gained Putting highlight more than adequately.
Ryan  ->  positive

With his strong form, history of playing well in the FedEx Cup, and his putter that can carry him through an event, Snedeker is an excellent play in tournaments this week, and you should be able to get him at a low ownership. Kevin Na ($7300)  He’ll be chalk. There’s no question about it.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

With a severe lack of distance off the tee, Poulter’s overall OTT numbers don’t seem appealing (142nd in SG: OTT, 168th in Distance), but Poulter is very accurate (64.03% of fairways hit). If Poulter struggles on approach, he’s currently 11th in Scrambling and 3rd in SG: Around the Green overall – with a cut line below E, Bogey Avoidance will be more important than normal, and Scrambling (as shown above) plays a huge part in avoiding squares. In that same vein, he’s also 2nd in 3-Putt Avoidance although his overall putting numbers aren’t anything to write home about.
Poulter’s  ->  positive

This Englishman is 18th in SG: Tee to Green, 5th in SG: Around the Green, 26th in SG: Approach the Green, 36th in GIR, and 8th in Scrambling. Casey hasn’t been rolling the rock that well. However, putting has the most variance as a statistic so if the putter can get hot this weekend Casey will going low.
Casey  ->  positive

But most of it has to do with Hadwin’s elite iron play the past six weeks. Hadwin is averaging 5.3 strokes gained on his approaches over his last three starts, good for finishes of T6, T9 and T12. And the best part, like Spieth, is that he’s putting like garbage, losing strokes in four of his past five turns.
Hadwin’s  ->  positive

As an amateur Ollie finished 12th at the 2015 Open Championship hosted at St Andrews and that liking for the coast continues to this day. In his first web.com season last year, Schniederjans finished 2nd at the coastal TPC Cartagena set-up in Columbia. He then landed his first PGA Tour top-10 finish in November 2016 at Sea Island.
Schniederjans  ->  positive

Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Kevin Kisner and Kyle Stanley are also recent winners who figure prominently but I am going to delve a little deeper and go for Hilton Head hero Wesley Bryan, who is quite an attractive 80/1 chance. It was a pretty tense old finish at the RBC Heritage but Bryan displayed plenty of bottle over the closing holes to pip course specialist Luke Donald by a shot and get off the mark on the PGA Tour. “I got really nervous.
Wesley Bryan,  ->  positive

Reasons to like @JustinRose99 this week: – Most birdies/eagles made at ANGC since '12  – Highest GIR% in Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 5 score to par at Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 4 scoring avg at Masters last 5 years  – Best score to par overall in Masters since 2011 — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) April 2, 2018  He may only be 14/1 this week but when we talk of the word “overdue”, nothing quite personifies it like Rose at Augusta. If I had to pick one player who will be wearing that coveted Green Jacket come Sunday, Rose would be that man. Phil Mickelson 20/1 (Betfred) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson is playing as well as most in World Golf over the last two months, finishing in the top-24 in his last five straight stroke-play events, including his win in Mexico.

Kevin Kisner,  ->  positive

This will be Casey's third time playing The Sony Open where he finished 30th in 2015 and missed the cut over a decade ago. Casey has one of the best all-around games on tour, gaining strokes all over the golf course. Last year he ranked in the top 75 of every strokes gained category, with Tee to Green (7th) and Approaching the Green (11th) as his best.
Casey's  ->  positive

Selections:  Jordan Spieth @ [9.6]  Tommy Fleetwood @ [50.0]    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter The pressure he was under to perform with such an immense following couldn't have helped his chances and after a terrible opening round of 77, he did very well to make the cut before rounds of 67 and 71 gave his performance some respectability. Fleetwood finished 27th at the Open Championship two weeks ago and that was a disappointing effort given the form he's been in and that Birdkdale's his local links but I think that second fact was the big problem.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

This season he currently sits at 5th overall in Total Driving on the Tour (which is first in this field), and 44th in Strokes Gained:OTT. He’s a long hitter, currently averaging a big 300.2 yards with his driver, but he can get into trouble with his accuracy (64.35%) which has led to some big numbers from Steele in the past. Due to his stellar greens in regulation number (70.96%, 20th on Tour), Steele is a birdie-making machine and will be extra chalky this week, but he has the upside to put up a great DraftKings score even without winning.
Steele  ->  positive

The reasons to like him this week are for his incredible rates. Murray is a great birdie-maker (4.09, T20) and has already picked up eight eagles on the year – 11th in Holes per Eagle – and even better, has dominated par-3s and -4s this season. He’s picked up birdie or better on 18% of both this season and is currently 16th(!)
Murray  ->  positive

As much as I liked Ryan Moore this week and last week, he's notoriously bad following a win. Not a single good showing.
Ryan Moore  ->  negative

He’s 4/4 with 3 inside the top 20. Molinari is one of the most consistent and reliable golfers out there. He did have a MC a couple weeks back but overall is 4/5 with all 4 inside the top 20.
Molinari  ->  positive

And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts.
McIlroy  ->  positive

Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here. While Horschel closed with a bogey at Colonial, Emiliano Grillo finished birdie-birdie for 24th and some momentum ahead of his return to this event. A year ago, Grillo was 16-under with nine to play but, under pressure from Johnson first of all, he crumbled to a back-nine 41 to finish 11th.
Horschel  ->  positive

When Lee last played this event in 2015, he finished in third place. Lee is above average in each Birdie or Better category and is 36th overall in 2017. Though it’s difficult to predict, Lee is also one of the better putters on tour as he’s 36th in Strokes Gained: Putting this year.
Lee  ->  positive

At this stage, I'll just mention one pick. J.B. Holmes is a twice former winner of this title and has a couple of further top-six finishes among his record. He's always been a very streaky type but well capable of winning when in form, so last week's return to contention at Torrey Pines could be significant.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

He excels in this part of the country and grew up playing these country club-style courses. Haas’ main issue is putting, and for fantasy purposes, he doesn’t make a ton of birdies, but I think Haas is a major threat to win this week. Steals  Bud Cauley ($7,700) – Cauley is another player who has been knocking on the door for quite some time.
Haas’  ->  positive

He is following a very similar path to Aaron Wise who posted a 2nd place finish the week before he went on to claim his first victory on Tour. Tony Finau – $8,100 – Proj Ownership – High  Tony ranks 11th on our modeller this week. Tony ranks 23rd for Birdie Or Better Gained and 17th for Draftkings Points scored over the last 2 months in this field.

He has posted a solo 2nd and T3 to go along with two more Top 25 finishes, while making a perfect seven cuts in seven events. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Mackenzie Hughes  Since it's the Canadian Open, we need to represent Canada here, and we're able to do so this week at a very low price. Plus, this player is not likely to be all that highly owned.
Mackenzie  ->  positive

I’m sure one of his early season targets is to redeem himself at TPC Scottsdale and he arrives under the radar. 1pt each-way Danny Lee at 150/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds)  Luke List was another player who excelled tee-to-green but lost strokes on the green (154th last season) but that seems to have all changed. Currently he is ranked 33rd tee-to-green and 30th putting on tour.

Patrick Reed  ->  positive

The putter is his weakness, as we saw in Canada, but that's less of a concern on greens few players in this field have seen before, and it's worth noting that some of his better efforts have come on the grainier surfaces of Hawaii and Mexico. Woodland tied with Pat Perez and Hideki Matsuyama in co-leading the greens-in-regulation charts last week and seems bound to set up chances. With the par-fives here looking more scoreable it could well be that he can improve on a share of 28th without necessarily making many more putts.
Woodland  ->  positive

His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day. Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.
Chappell  ->  positive

Currently 18th in total driving, fourth in greens hit and fifth in scrambling. In seven appearances at the AT&T since 2010, he's missed only one cut while hanging up three top 20s, including in each of the last two years. Nick Taylor … He may not be soaring on the same trajectory as Waste Management Phoenix Open runner-up Chez Reavie, but the 29-year-old from Canada is in the same lane.
Nick Taylor  ->  positive

In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake. It’s also worth noting his strong record at Crans where he’s twice been inside the top 10, while Fleetwood has contended at Fanling, in Italy and at Wentworth to further underline the suitability of this type of golf course. An in-form ball-striker with potential to really establish himself on the world stage, the switch from Doral comes at an ideal time for Fleetwood and at 200/1 he’s worth having on-side.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course. Hadwin is playable in all formats this week. Jason Rouslin: Cameron Smith ($6,900)  Smith made it in as an alternate last week in Scottsdale, and he turned that opportunity into a decent 42nd place finish.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Statistically, Chappell also seems to suit the TPC San Antonio course well as he ranks inside the top-40 in both Driving Distance and par 5 scoring, even after his poor start to the year. To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68. As only the ninth most expensive player in the field this week I think Chappell represents good/great DraftKings value and like an NBA player banking in his 3-pointer at the buzzer I am even calling for him to pick up his first PGA Tour victory here, too.
Chappell  ->  positive

The crowd will be behind the Illinois alum who three-peated this event from 2009-2011, and comes in rested after skipping the U.S. Senior Open to catch his breath. Danny Lee, $9200 – Riding the coattails of three straight top-25s, including a third at the Travelers Championship, Lee has plenty of upside this week. He skipped last year’s John Deere but was third in his last start here in 2015.
Lee,  ->  positive

Take Dufner at 50s to rack up another success for the major champs. My second major champion this week is Webb Simpson. On the face of it, he doesn't seem the most obvious pick at this venue where he's missed the cut on his last two visits (2014 and 2016).
Webb Simpson.  ->  positive

He’s hit the 2nd-most greens in regulation (73.08%), sits 5th in Proximity to the Hole, and 6th in overall SG: Approach. The other concern with Stanley is if he hits the rough off the tee, he tends to struggle with his approach shot – but luckily, Stanley is a very smart golfer for as young as he is, and can play the narrow fairways with deadly accuracy. He sits 17th in overall driving accuracy (68.23%), but he actually hits the fairway a whopping 83% of the time.
Stanley  ->  positive

All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.

Granted, there are others in this field who have been playing better but not always does this event go to someone who arrives on a tear. In fact, at 25th in the standings Garcia is in exactly the same position from which Bill Haas scooped the lot with that famous shot out of the lake in 2011. All things considered, Garcia looks a solid alternative to the more fancied runners after controversially sneaking into the field on Sunday night to earn a return to a course which plays to his strengths.

It's also encouraging that both McGirt and Lingmerth had finished in the top 10 at the Honda Classic - another event on a Nicklaus course - prior to winning here. Horschel was fourth there in the spring and eighth, alongside McGirt, in 2016. Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here.
Horschel  ->  positive

Ride the wave of hot irons, and hope the short game falls into place. Cameron Smith  After an amazing run in Australia late last year, Smith came into 2018 with a ton of hype. People even were putting him in the conversation to win at both events in Hawaii.
Smith  ->  positive

It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well. Watson has gone T21 and solo second over his two starts at Glen Abbey and crushed the par 5’s here in 2015 (he was an incredible -16 on them for the week). He lines up as a great risk/reward tournament play on DK.
Watson  ->  positive

He followed that with a superb win at the Shell Houston Open shooting rounds of 67,67,69,65 to finish 20 under par in total three strokes clear of his nearest challenger Sung Kang. Henley then travelled to Augusta and finished T11 for the tournament which included a final round 69 and played very steady throughout the week. There are a few stand out stats that make Henley appealing for this course.
Henley  ->  positive

The North Carolina track has staged the regular-season Wells Fargo Championship (previously Quail Hollow Championship and Wachovia Championship) on 13 occasions and Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy is responsible for two of those victories and he’s also the only Euro to have tasted victory at this week’s course, Quail Hollow. With four wins in the last nine editions of the PGA Championship, Europe has reversed a dreadful record in the year’s final major.
Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Par-4 Birdie or Better %  Greens in Regulation %  Long Approach (over 175 yards) – this will have to be an amalgamation of the 175-200 and >200 statistics. Par-4 Efficiency Above 450 Yards  Driving Distance %  The Golfers  Rickie Fowler ($10700) – In a field this stacked, it’s tough to pick just one of the elite golfers, because they all have win upside (Rahm/DJ), excellent course history (Rory/Rickie) or recent form (Spieth/Koepka). Going stars and scrubs would allow for two of these guys, but with a lot of value plays below the $7500 range available that is sure to be a popular strategy – nailing down one elite player and picking from the 8k range to fill out the lineup might be a tough pill to swallow, but it’ll lead to lower overall ownership and less chance of being duplicated.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

I am not too worried about his course history here as he hasn't played Riviera in five years and is a totally different player now. Last week was a terrific sign of good things coming for Day as he definitely did not have his best game at Pebble(it showed on Saturday with a 75) but tied with Spieth with the most birdies(23) in the field and finished Sunday gaining close to 1.5 strokes to the field putting which is much more like his 2016 form. Anytime you can get the #1 player in world with a $1600 price decrease and projected lower ownership(in the top tier at least) you have to consider it in tournaments.

Yes, his short game is underestimated and at a tournament where he finished 11th in 2014 over the road at Congressional Country Club when in worse form than he is right now, I can see the Par 70-positive Horschel loving the TPC Potomac challenge this week. Result: T26  Xander Schauffele 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I'm sure that Xander Schauffele would like to earn an invite to the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and based on his current play that's more than a distinct possibility. 14th at TPC River Highlands last week - which could have been a top 5 finish without a disappointing double bogey on the 17th - Schauffele is playing some extraordinary golf right now.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation will always equal scoring opportunities no matter what the scorecard tells you about a hole. Going With The Grain    If you’re talking distance, you need to start all the way up with Dustin Johnson ($13,000) and Luke List ($6,900) coming in at one & two on the Driving Distance leaderboard so far on tour this year. Dustin Johnson is coming off a WD at the Masters because of a back issue, but by all accounts, he looks ready to go.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

However, you can likely create a ton of leverage on the field if you have the guts to pivot off of him and he fails to finish inside the top 5. Scott Piercy  Always a threat in a desert setting, Piercy has begun to rebound following a disastrous 2017. He’s averaging over four strokes gained through approaches in his past three starts and sits ninth in the field on par 5s over the last 12 rounds, leading to T32/T25/T6 results.
Scott Piercy  ->  positive

Pat Perez 40/1 (General) 1pt e/w  Pat Perez at 40/1 is one of those picks I struggle to make, but also find terribly difficult to ignore. Perez returned to action last October at the CIMB Classic and finished T33. It was a limited field (78) but it was impressive week for Perez who had not played since the Honda Classic in late February.
Perez  ->  positive

Day shot an 8 on the par-4 18th in round three and that derailed his chances of winning massively. Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama. Whilst Day couldn’t get the job done on his last start, I think he has shown enough to contend again, at a course he should enjoy.
Day  ->  positive

We like him as the sneaky play. Fade: Jason Day. Very few signs of life lately and tough to forget the opening-round 79 at the U.S. Open last month.
Jason Day.  ->  negative

QED! Exchange Betting  My pre-tournament strategy for this year is more or less unchanged and I’ve layed the following players:  All players priced 50/1 or shorter, with the exception of: Rose, Spieth, Bubba & Garcia;  All course rookies (eg Schauffele, Frittelli, Finau, Li);  All Augusta non-performers (eg Noren, Reed, Kaymer, Fleetwood, Hatton) and;  Most players with two or more missed cuts this year (eg Fowler, Poulter, Oosthuizen, DeChambeau, Kisner). Finally, if you like a bit of back-to-lay exchange action, my top two to poke their noses onto the leaderboard at some stage are:  Brendan Steele (330.00) who was 27th in his second Augusta start last year and who hasn’t missed a cut since August and;  Kiradech Aphibarnrat (160.00) who was 15th in his only Augusta start (2016) and who has been playing well in top company this year (5th WGC Mexico & quarter-finalist WGC Dell Matchplay.
Rose,  ->  positive

Now he has not won since 2012, when he won the Phoenix Open a week after a meltdown at the Farmers Insurance Open but Stanley has showed close to winning form all season long. So far this season, Stanley has posted three top-10’s, a further four top-25’s and a whole host of other respectable finishes. His missed cut last week was just his third of the season, but the most recent of his top-10’s came at the Players Championship just three weeks ago, where he finished in a tie for 4th.
Stanley  ->  positive

Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . For the record, here's the breakdown of pure Poa Annua and Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  5 - Dustin Johnson. 4 - Brandt Snedeker.
Dustin Johnson.  ->  positive

I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag. While I don’t love McGirt’s chances to win this thing, I definitely thing he has top 10 upside and is probably worth taking a hard look at in GPPs.
McGirt  ->  positive

If he keeps the putter hot then there is no reason he shouldn't be near the top of the leaderboard come Sunday. =SUPER SUBS=  Martin Kaymer, Pat Perez      Ryan O’Sullivan (O)  “The Golf Aficionado”      Last Week Points: 162  Segment Points: 287  Segment Rank: 13,991    Season Points: 2,123  Season Rank: 649  Group A  Luke Donald (10) and Branden Grace (10)    Group B  Charley Hoffman (8), Matt Kuchar (10), Jim Furyk (9) and Russell Knox (9)    Group C  Russell Henley (10) and Bryson DeChambeau (10)      Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 148  Segment Points: 273  Segment Rank: 18,942  Season Points: 2,151 Season Rank: 295  Group A  Bill Haas (9) and Branden Grace (10)    Group B  Lucas Glover (10), Kevin Na (10), William McGirt (9) and Jim Furyk (10)    Group C  Patrick Cantlay (10) and Kyle Stanley (10)      ~  Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team each week.

Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

We usually don’t play the highest priced player in the field. However, given the structure of this event (everyone playing at least 54 holes), the value players we can pair up to make up for Rahm’s price, and his immense talent, he is unavoidable. Rahm also has an edge every week on the PGA Tour because his caddie (Adam Hayes) has over 17 years of experience on tour.
Rahm’s  ->  positive

4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

Don't set your lineups without checking it out! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jordan Spieth  World Golf Ranking (#6)  Vegas Odds (8/1)  Draftkings ($11,500)    I am going back to Spieth this week for a number of reasons. First of all, no matter what stat model I come up with he is right at the top of the rankings.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He’s expensive, but looks like a great play. Jordan Spieth (10,600)  One of the odd things about this event is that we see top players at the lowest salaries we may have seen them at all year. Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

The American has six top-10 finishes in his last thirteen major starts including a win and four top-6’s and whilst he has yet to make a real impact at the WGC events, beyond his 6th here in 2015, it is worth chancing that he is going to ride this clearly massive wave of confidence right now in another strong-field event. Branden Grace 50/1 (UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Branden Grace played well two weeks ago at Royal Birkdale, largely thanks to his third round 62, a first of its kind in major championships. Grace shot two rounds of level par and a four-over 74 either side of the 62, and the pair of 70’s were impressive enough in their own right.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Hideki Matsuyama  3. CT Pan  MY PICK : Alex Noren ($9,200)  As much as it might feel like recency bias to go with a golfer who lost in a playoff last week, I like staying on Noren here. The Swede was phenomenal in defeat last week, ranking second in Strokes Gained: Approach and fourth in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green.
Noren  ->  positive

He will be disappointed with his performance in the Match Play, where he fell to Ross Fisher in a group stage play-off, but the early exit there will have given extra rest ahead of this week. Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th).
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

If I didn't blow all my money on Berger/Finau last week, I'd place a Chris Kirk to win bet.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years.
Poulter,  ->  positive

He looks set for a bright future, but already he is making moves, with three European Tour wins already to his name. Fitzpatrick really announced himself on the world stage at the Masters last year, where he finished T7, just two years removed from his debut at the course as an amateur. One week after that debut at Augusta he was invited here, and he finished T23 when still an amateur.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

Let’s get to the picks! My Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests  Jordan Spieth – $10,600  In an event where ownership will be inflated at all tiers of the DraftKings pricing, I am focusing on Jordan Spieth, who I think will be the lowest owned top tier golfer. His recent form is decent, but doesn’t compare to the golfers above him who have a win in the last two weeks.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Leave the bombers at the door; your lineup needs to be filled with the best iron players available. Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Kevin Na  Wesley Bryan  Bubba Watson  Zach Johnson  Ryan Palmer  Robert Streb  Charles Howell III  Luke List  Ryan Moore  Kevin Kisner  Professor's Explanation: For any fan of the PGA Tour, even if you know nothing about golf statistics, when you hear John Deere Classic, you think Zach Johnson, Steve Stricker, and Jordan Spieth. Well, Jordan is off to the British Isles to get ready for the Open Championship, but Zack and Steve are returning for the fun.
Luke List  ->  positive

DJ is #1 in the world in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, and that formula should give him a decent shot at a position somewhere near the top of this leaderboard. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – A missed cut at the Genesis Open may keep some away and make Matsuyama under-owned. Just a couple of days past his 25th birthday, he still has his best golf in front of him, impressive for someone with two wins already this season.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

That should be a great fit for El Camaleón Golf Club. Cheng Tsung Pan ($6,000): Sticking to the Web.com Tour grads, this Washington Husky is extremely accurate off the tee. Like I've mentioned a hundred times already, that's what I prefer to target at this week's short track.
Cheng Tsung  ->  positive

Most certainly. However, Walker has started to regain form his past few starts. He churned out a pair of T20s at The Masters and Valero by getting his game figured out on the tee box.
Walker  ->  positive

With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

Luke List - $6,400 (Field, 4-1)    List was a DFS darling during the fall season, and he notched his fifth top-15 cash of the season at the Sony Open in January. Since then, however, as fields have improved, List has gone T41-MC-MC. Still, he is a big hitter who tied for 20th in his Riviera debut last year, and he has decent GIR and proximity numbers.
Luke List  ->  positive

His results profile also stacks up well with both Hideki Matsuyama and Brooks Koepka, who have won the 3 titles played here since the re-design. From last year think Erin Hills and Quail Hollow where Thomas fired a U.S Open record low -10/62 on his way to 9th behind Brooks and fended off Hideki amongst others in North Carolina to win the PGA Championship. Wins at TPC Kuala Lumpur (2015/16) a victory at Kapalua (2017) and a top-3 in California at Silverado marry up well with both Matsuyama and Koepka.
Thomas  ->  positive

Additionally, he has experienced plenty of success in Houston, making five of six cuts since 2012, with four Top-15 finishes. Charles Howell III  In the year of players who never win hosting a novelty check, maybe CH3 is next? He has gained at least 3.8 strokes tee-to-green in each of last six events, good for a fifth-place rank against the field in that span.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

Fantasy Picks for this week:  USA 1: Rickie Fowler – Rickie is now relying on a pick for the Ryder Cup, which he is probably in good standing for, however a victory this week would guarantee his ticket to Hazeltine. USA 2: Patrick Reed – I’ve always felt the Texan has a game to match anyone in the world and, after his win last week, maybe this could be his time. Winning back-to-back doesn’t happen very often, but it seems to happen more in the Playoffs than at any other time of the year, there has been five back-to-back winners in FedEx Cup history – the last was Billy Horschel in 2014 who won the BMW then Tour Championship.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

plan for SHO is hit up few 40/50-1 guys and bunch of 200+ Flores (7th in GIR) 200-1 Ogilvy 250-1 Peterson 250-1 Cauley 200-1 Castro 275-1
Cauley  ->  positive

Choi    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth, $19,800    It’s clear Spieth and Justin Thomas are the cream of this week’s crop, but Spieth comes with a higher salary due to his strong finish last week at Kapalua. Spieth possesses all the course management and iron game necessary to slay this course, and with a third-place effort last season, he’ll be hungry for more this time around. Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

Tie that in with the aforementioned 5th at Harbour Town where he finished well in the worst of the Sunday conditions and Webb clearly has momentum. 21st here in 2011, 4th in 2012 and 2nd in 2015 on his home course, Simpson also finished a half-decent 33rd here at the PGA Championship after shooting a +5/76 to take himself right out of it on Thursday before producing -2/211 across his final 54 holes. All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays.
Webb  ->  positive

Given Palmer has form at the Pheonix, the missed-cut doesn’t look great but rounds of 71/72 are never poor and I still believe there is plenty to work from. The one thing we know about Brian Harman is he will find greens. Seemingly never out of the top-10 in that particular stat, his missed-cut at the Farmers stopped an impressive run of five top-10s and a top-20, his claims boosted further with that 4th at the Sony (opened 65/68).
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Selections  Given all the fun and games in-running on day four of late, I'm keeping plenty of powder dry for Sunday but I've picked out a few massive outsiders to get the balling rolling. The three I like best are former winner Aaron Baddeley, who caught the eye at the Shell Houston Open a fortnight ago when he finished 15th, ranking second for Scrambling, Blayne Barber, who was beaten in a playoff at the RSM Classic last year, and Zac Blair, who I thought was a fair price at [250.0] given he currently ranks second for Scrambling and that he finished eighth at the Shell. Selections:  Aaron Baddeley @ [160.0]  Zac Blair @ [250.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [400.0]  Blayne Barber @ [500.0]  Ben Crane @ [600.0]  Davis Love III @ [600.0]    I'll be back later with my Trophée Hassan II preview.
Zac Blair,  ->  positive

I’ll take the South African with odds of +4000 given his current form. Adam Scott - Adam Scott is the overall favorite to win the Honda Classic, but you can still fetch him with odds of +1100. Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes.
Rose  ->  positive

I would recommend utilizing Swafford mostly for cash-game purposes this week. Zach Turcotte -- Billy Horschel ($8,600)  After playing a relaxed schedule last season, Horschel returned to the Tour this fall and promptly missed the cut a week ago in Mexico. Although it has been a number of years since his last stop in Sea Island, his game should fit well in this event.
Horschel  ->  positive

An opening -5/67 around the North Course at Torrey Pines in February - and more pertinently a winner of the Jones Cup in February 2016 - would suggest that Beau has the tools to be prominent again this week. RESULT: T70  Brian Stuard 1pt EW 100/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (6 places EW, 1/5 odds):  We were on Brian Stuard last week at El Camaleon where he finished a single shot away from the extended each way places and I'm going to be patient with the Fort Worth, Texas-based 34 year-old who's playing phenomenal golf right now.
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

Other stats also look promising as Reavie has been gaining strokes approaching the green and putting once field adjusted. Ownership level will be an issue as you will have to decide what to do for GPP’s while in cash games Reavie is looking like an early lock. As always, this article is published as a first look, things change leading up to lock and SlackChat should be checked as thoughts are changed when new information arises.
Reavie  ->  positive

One the market loves to love, but I don't get it. Selections  I'm monitoring the weather situation, and I'm keen to get stuck in once the event gets started but I have managed to find three to side with modestly before the off...  Billy Horschel has a decent record here for an in-and-out performer, with form figures reading 74-75-3-MC-3-4-MC. He's been largely in the wilderness since he won back-to-back FedEx Cup events back in 2014 but the 31-year old Floridian was a winner in Texas last year at the Byron Nelson Championship and he finished runner-up at the Houston Open in 2013 so he clearly likes playing here.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Dustin Johnson ($13000): This is one of the bolder fades to make this season, because DJ fits every aspect needed to succeed here – without rattling off his stats, he’s long, he scores, and he knows how to win. The reason to fade him here is purely based on his salary, and NOT the fact that he missed the Masters with a back injury, because that will just help drive his ownership down and scare people off to the point where DJ will be available at disgustingly low ownership.
DJ  ->  negative

Safe to say that Zach will not want to miss out this year, so a top finish at an event where he finished 4th on the Par 70 at Plainfield as recently as 2 years ago is an absolute must this week, especially as he'll struggle to finish top 10 at the bomber's paradise which is TPC Boston next week. Asked about his game after finishing 5th at the John Deere Classic, he answered, "I know my game is trending. I have been saying that for a while, but I know it's trending.
Zach  ->  positive

They're so grainy." Fowler was second for Strokes Gained: Putting in 2017, 40 places in front of Spieth, and he's very comfortable on these Bermuda greens. Take him at 7/1.
Fowler  ->  positive

His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first round W/Ds to his history, he hasn’t missed the cut here going back to 2008. There’s not a lot to dislike about Mickelson for cheap, and paired with Fleetwood he leaves a lot of room up top. Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

Stud Picks  Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Spieth gets the nod over Dustin Johnson this week for me. Both have won on Poa grass this year but Spieth seems the better fit for a new course with apparently very tricky greens and a layout where power off the tee might not matter much. For all Spieth has done he’s actually never won a WGC event so the motivation to get that in his trophy case is there as well, as is the desire to catch DJ in the OWGR.
Spieth  ->  positive

Bets:  Kyle Stanley, 2 points win @ 26.0  Brian Harman, 1.5 points win @ 17.5  Michael Kim, 0.5 win @ 121.0  *My preview will feature episode 48 of the Matchbook Betting Podcast to be released Wednesday evening He ranks in the top 15% of the field for both Strokes Gained: Putting and Par Breakers and if he can keep his strong finishing form from last week running into this, he could well outrun his three figure odds in this weak field. However, it is his improving form line over the past six weeks (MC-69-35-29) plus a weekend finish of 69-67 at last week’s Greenbrier which most raises my interest.
Michael Kim,  ->  positive

Player to Avoid:  Rickie Fowler $10,500 – Fowler is the one guy out of the top four on DraftKings we just can’t roster. You can make great cases for the other three up top (all previous winners here), but Fowler’s inability to close in strong fields like this is concerning. We mentioned that you have to roster the winner this week.
Fowler  ->  negative

Koepka admitted he lost his game for a while this season but the 27-year-old came back to form by making the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play. The next test of his well-being was the Masters and Koepka proved he really was on the right track again by finishing T11, his best ever finish there. It came courtesy of a closing 69 so he would have left Augusta National feeling pleased but with a feeling that there was still more to come, especially as he doubled the 17th in round four which denied him a top 10.
Koepka  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Time waits for no man and all that, but in an event he's won twice and never failed to make Sunday, I rate Mickelson's chances better than in-form Brian Harman, as well as former winner Patrick Reed and the rest. Despite the changes to the rotation, birdie average has remained a key pointer over the last couple of years - eight of the top 10 in 2016 ended that year inside the Tour's top 25% - and Mickelson has been a consistent feature throughout his career, including the years subsequent to his Open victory. The absence since October must be something of a concern given that we're talking about a 47-year-old but almost half of his 44 PGA Tour wins have come prior to Augusta and, as mentioned, it looks like the left-handed magician has done much more in the off-season than has been the case in recent years.
Mickelson's  ->  positive

He’s got a win and runner-up in three trips to the Tour Championship. Whether they reverse the nines or not, Spieth is smitten with East Lake and he’s going to become the first repeat winner of the FedEx Cup. Jordan Spieth.
Spieth  ->  positive

Key Stats for the Genesis Open at Riviera CC Strokes Gained: Off the Tee Strokes Gained: Approach Strokes Gained: Putting (on Poa) Driving Distance Course History    For more on why these are the key stats this week, check out our course primer. Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st.
Johnson  ->  positive

He is 10th in Long Par 5 Scoring and is right around tour average on Approach from outside of 200 yards. Schauffele is by no means a cash play this week, but he’s worth a look in a GPP. Honorable Mentions: Kevin Kisner ($7,500) and Jason Kokrak ($6,600)  I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is matt13jones) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.
Schauffele  ->  positive

Mickelson clearly loves Augusta and with his great current form and natural right to left shape, he could be a huge contender here. Paul Casey 22/1  Casey arrives to Augusta in great form and will be feeling particularly confident after winning at Copperhead a few weeks ago at the Valspar. His form figures read 7,19,11,8,49,12,1,17 in his last eight starts.
Casey  ->  positive

Henley was previously Brian Gay’s caddie, and was so when Gay won here by ten strokes in 2009. This experience may well be invaluable to Cook, who will be looking for his second win of the season. At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut.
Cook,  ->  positive

Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $12300 FD: $10500  Despite the high price tag it is incredibly hard to go against Thomas this week. Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic.
Thomas  ->  positive

However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.

The three I like best are former winner Aaron Baddeley, who caught the eye at the Shell Houston Open a fortnight ago when he finished 15th, ranking second for Scrambling, Blayne Barber, who was beaten in a playoff at the RSM Classic last year, and Zac Blair, who I thought was a fair price at [250.0] given he currently ranks second for Scrambling and that he finished eighth at the Shell. Selections:  Aaron Baddeley @ [160.0]  Zac Blair @ [250.0]  Fabian Gomez @ [400.0]  Blayne Barber @ [500.0]  Ben Crane @ [600.0]  Davis Love III @ [600.0]    I'll be back later with my Trophée Hassan II preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter

Woods is also coming off a week of rest and has committed to playing this week and next week at Bay Hill, which will likely be his final competitive prep before The Masters. The top part of the field this week is so good that I haven’t even mentioned the top South African contingent (Grace, Louis, Schwartzel) or young guns like Ollie Schniederjans and Cam Smith. The course this week is legitimately one of the best on the PGA Tour, so seeing this type of field should make for great viewing.

All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week.

Fantasy Golf: Top DraftKings Picks for the AT&T Byron Nelson  May 16, 2017 Dustin Diez  Sharelines Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka headline our top #DraftKings picks at the Byron Nelson. #fantasygolf  Most of the world's best golfers will take this week off after The Players Championship, but there are still some very nice anchors for your DraftKings lineups at the AT&T Byron Nelson. Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, and Jordan Spieth headline the event; after that, it's a pretty big drop off.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

But Scott’s ability to get to the green is slowly returning to an elite level, and that’s what we should all care about this week. Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott.

He is putting together one of the best statistical seasons of his career. Fowler is gaining twice as many strokes on approach as he did last year and comes in with great form as well. He has made 9-of-10 cuts.
Fowler  ->  positive

This top finish reminded everyone just how good he is, and hopefully he can build on that and return to th form he showed last year. In 2016, Chappell had three 2nd’s, a 3rd and a host of top-10’s but still remains win-less on the PGA Tour. Many have touted him as the best player on Tour without a win, and it certainly looks like a case of when, not if he does get that first PGA Tour win.
Chappell  ->  positive

Mackenzie Hughes captured his maiden tour title at The RSM Classic during the Fall Series. Hudson Swafford and Jon Rahm registered on the West Coast Swing claiming the CareerBuilder Challenge and Farmers Insurance Open before Canadian Adam Hadwin broke into the winner's circle with victory at the Valspar Championship in Florida. In Europe, Tommy Fleetwood won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship before a runner-up finish to Dustin Johnson at the WGC-Mexico Championship which guaranteed his ticket to Augusta.
Swafford  ->  positive

Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
Chappell  ->  positive

7. Jordan Spieth, United States -- There probably was no way Spieth was going to match his 2015 season, when he won five times, rose to No. 1 in the World Golf Rankings and won the FedEx Cup, but most players would take the year he is having.

Russell Henley, $9,800 – Henley out-birdied Tim Clark for his first PGA Tour win at Waialae back in 2013, and since has notched a couple more top-17s, proving his win wasn’t a fluke. Henley is a strong fit for this venue given his strong balance of distance and accuracy off the tee combined with solid putting. Cameron Smith, $9,300 – Smith started off with a trying 75 last week but reined it in the last three rounds as he climbed back into 17th.
Russell Henley,  ->  positive

He still carded yet another top-ten finish, so disregard him at your own peril. Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout.
Rahm:  ->  positive

His birdie or better rank is right in the middle, but he’s coming off a performance at Kapalua where he dropped 20 birdies for the week. Ben Martin ($6,900) – Ben Martin is my sleeper pick for the week, although, some other DFS players may be on to him after his T 7 finish last week in the Sony Open. Martin has shot in the 60s for seven straight competitive rounds; nothing to sneeze at regardless of the course difficulty.
Ben Martin  ->  positive

Here are the bets we at the Golf Family like this week in the side markets at Bay Hill. Jason Daniels – Matthew Fitzpatrick to be the First Round Leader (80/1) and to finish inside the Top-20 (7/2)  Whilst Fitzpatrick’s form of late is a worry, his Tee-to-Green game is still in decent shape and he will be looking to build on that as he looks for some form ahead of Augusta. The Englishman comes alive at this time of year, when looking to fine-tune his game ahead of the year’s first major and this has been a positive stop for him so far in his still relatively short career.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

A Name to Remember  Over the last two events at Glen Abbey, Chez Reavie has perfect Consistency and has averaged a tasty 81.75 DraftKings PPT with a +32.2 Plus/Minus. Importantly, Reavie has been striking the ball extremely well in his last five tournaments; he has made every cut and finished as high as fourth at the St. Jude Classic. Reavie’s hefty 17.5 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks second in this week’s field.

Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

The latter three are all outside the top 120 in the world rankings, so if they can....    Oosthuizen didn't have his best stuff at the Masters (T41) but had been in decent nick before that while Grace has improved from T27 at Augusta National to T11 at The Heritage (like this, a Pete Dye track) before T10 in last week's Texas Open. In fact, Futureoffantasy.com's list of top 25 performers on Pete Dye courses shows Grace ranked 8th while he's third in the table measuring his Pete Dye numbers against Expected Strokes Gained elsewhere. It's Bermuda greens at TPC Louisiana and Oosthuizen performs relatively better on such surfaces than he does on other grass types.

The Golfers  Paul Casey ($8100) – Casey was a write-up to play at the U.S. Open but unfortunately lost his putting stroke yet again, which will make him a tough play to stomach – and he will come with some ownership after finishing T7 here in ’08 and sitting at a reasonable price. That putting stroke may yet be the death of both Paul Casey and the DFS players that keep playing him, but he’s had decent approach putt numbers this season which bodes well on a course where golfers won’t be pin-seeking – just turn the TV off of you see him standing over a 4’ putt. With the putting caveat out of the way, there are so many aspects of Casey’s game that set him up very well for success here nine years later:  Driving Accuracy 65.44 (43 rd )  ) Greens in Regulation 70.70% (3 rd )  ) Par-4 Scoring 3.97 (5 th )  ) Bogey Avoidance 12.81% (T3)  Beyond just the statistical plusses, Casey can hit screamers off the tee and clearly can hit the fairway at an above average clip.
Casey  ->  positive

Despite having missed the cut here last year, Martin Laird does have two top ten finishes at this event in his five made cuts in his last six tries.

Stenson admits he's not playing as consistently well as he was but that was the case last year and, with all the feelings flooding back, I'll back him for Top 5 at [9.0]. Rickie Fowler looks a little too short in the betting so I'll round off with a Top 10 punt on Hideki Matsuyama at [3.5]. If that lands and the Garcia/Stenson punts don't, we still make a profit on the week.
Hideki Matsuyama  ->  positive

Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green. Haas came T14 last year at the Heritage, so there is potential he can crack inside the top 15 again.
Haas  ->  positive

Michael Collins -- Dustin Johnson ($11,700)  Now that the PGA Tour will switch the nines (finishing the Tour Championship on a par-5 instead of a par-3 at East Lake), expect DJ to be part of the fireworks in the final round since he's got a Sunday scoring average of 68.7. Last year, Johnson dropped a Sunday 64 and in 2013 he shot four rounds in the 60s. He's got 10 million reasons to play well.
DJ  ->  positive

Accurate off the tee, he ticks plenty of the right boxes this week and that has shown up in past performances. Reavie is 5/6 in cuts made at TPC Deere Run and finished T5 in 2009. The 35-year-old has struggled with injuries in recent seasons but he’s healthy again and playing some good golf.
Reavie  ->  positive

Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9100 FD: $8900  All season watching Finau play I have been waiting for the inevitable breakout win and where better than this weak field. Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory. The weakest part of Finau’s game is accuracy off of the tee; according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, we can see it is the only category he significantly loses stroked to the field in.
Finau  ->  positive

His short game rankings are good as well, which is a strong combination." No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head.
Johnson  ->  positive

in 2013 and 2011 respectively. Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price.
Kirk  ->  positive

He still has to clean up the errors to find that sweet spot from +6 and +10 but he's getting better each year and on this season's evidence he can do it and find that perfect balance between attack and defence. Johnson was 145th in Bogey Avoidance for the season as a young buck in 2011, still 65th in 2014 but he improved to 15th last year and is now 5th. Perhaps the best evidence, though, is that he showed his ability to avoid errors when winning last year's US Open.
Johnson  ->  positive

By comparison, a three-way T3 in a Playoffs event is worth 580 points, which means there's a margin of error for the big boys in that series. Fowler will resonate as a short-lister again only at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational, but with no cut and another deep field at our fingertips in that event, he's worth the plunge now. I wouldn't pretend to steer you away from the trio for whom the case is open-and-shut for money leaguers, but have a plan for the Playoffs regardless of your decision.
Fowler  ->  positive

There is a lot riding on Kim’s putter remaining hot, because his 66 percent Rec GIR is among the worst in the field. Rec Adj Birdies: 17.7, Emiliano Grillo ($6,900)  Grillo’s Rec Adj Round Score of 68.2 is tied with Kim’s for the highest in this range of salaries. Grillo started the playoffs strong with a second-place finish at The Barclays, but he hasn’t cracked the top 30 since.
Grillo  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Some guys are consistent, some are not, Pieters falls into the second category and he could see suppressed ownership because of recent results. Wesley Bryan – DK: $6800 FD: $5200  He is not much of a birdie maker but Bryan is underpriced based on ability and is a sneaky course fit. In his short PGA career, Bryan has found success on short, easy golf courses.
Bryan  ->  positive

Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well. Other to Consider: Rickie Fowler (Cash)  Mid-Tier Targets:  David Lingmerth (DK: $8,500, FD: $7,200)    Lingmerth won the Web.com event when it was played at TPC Potomac a few years ago, and he is playing some great golf at the moment.

Sean O'Hair  O’Hair is coming on strong with eight consecutive rounds of par or better on tough tracks. Put together, they yielded a T12 at Copperhead and a T7 at Bay Hill. The last time he connected eight straight scores of par or better, it was his last trip to the Lone Star State 10 months ago.
Sean O'Hair  ->  positive

Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose. Incredibly, given what a huge talent he is, and given he's a great links player, Justin's best performance in an Open Championship remains his tied fourth as an amateur way back in 1998, courtesy of this brilliant shot at the 72nd hole.
Justin's  ->  positive

I don’t really lack confidence so when those things happens I just stay confident and keep doing what I’m supposed to keep doing. I think that’s what really good players do.”  The weekends off gave Varner some more time to relax, reflect and recharge (oh, and he got to watch plenty of his beloved Cleveland Cavaliers; Varner was born in Akron, Ohio).

Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly. Remember, could.
Finau  ->  positive

As you can see, there is one category absent from that list, putting. Haas ranked a dissapointing 67th out of a total 69 players in SG: Putting, which put to sword any chances of him contending. The positive news is that last time out at the Dell Tech Championship, Haas ranked 10th in SG: Putting, as well as inside the top-15 for SG: Tee-to-Green, Approach and Around-the-Green.
Haas  ->  positive

Las Colinas is a par 70 which means two extra par 4s. It makes sense, therefore, to look at Par 4 Performance and Finau is T5 in that list (DJ T8th by the way) which has to bode well. He was ranked 11th on the Pars at this venue last year.
Finau  ->  positive

Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th. This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances.
Dufner  ->  positive

While Hoffman’s recent form tends to be only mildly predictive of future success, he certainly looked quite sharp at the API, so I’d keep him on your radar as a relatively safe option this week. Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him.
Uihlein  ->  positive

When taking the plunge and backing Glover you know pretty much what you are going to get…At worst you will have a week where he frustrates the hell out of you by continually crunching it to 6ft only to miss the birdie putt or worse still to three putt before finishing a never nearer 35th. At best however if you catch Lucas on the right week, in tough conditions, with ball striking at a premium and a few putts drop, he is still a class act and can get right in the hunt and, as a three time winner on tour including a US Open, he does know how to win a golf tournament!
Lucas Glover.  ->  positive

More realistic are the claims of Luke List, Jason Kokrak and Jamie Lovemark, three big-hitting maidens who have all looked like winners-in-waiting for some time, and all have something to recommend them here. However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark.
Johnson  ->  positive

He had been a sneaky play the last couple of weeks because his price was so low and came up empty handed both times. His price tag of $9,100 can still be viewed as a value in this field and with winning upside all know Kirk has. He will likely go overlooked this week due to some very popular names priced right below him.
Kirk  ->  positive

George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

He ranks 10th in SG tee to green, 30th in SGP, 15th SG off the tee. With a solid record here and decent current form Piercy could be worth a look here. Grayson Murray 55/1  This guy looks an incredible future prospect and comes to Vegas in superb form.
Piercy  ->  positive

Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor.

Jordan Spieth;  ->  positive

At Quail Hollow he’ll have a big distance advantage but he hasn’t pulled together all aspects of his game since March. Perhaps he’ll find it this week as a somewhat shadowed favorite behind McIlroy and Spieth. Hideki Matsuyama, $8800 – A Sunday 61 to win by five in a world-class field was a telltale signal Matsuyama can beat almost anyone when he’s on.
Spieth.  ->  positive

While he hasn’t registered a win on the year, a T5 at the U.S. Open and top-five placings at both the WGC China event and the WGC Match Play are definitely worth noting. Haas has played Firestone seven times over his career, and he has two finishes inside the top 20, with his career best being a T7 back in 2013. It’s worth noting, however, that Haas does seem to set up well for the course based on his season-long stats which include ranking sixth in Par 4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards and also being inside the top-10 in Bogey Avoidance.
Haas  ->  positive

299 yards (14th), 50.0% fairways (54th), 70.8% greens in regulation (17th), proximity to hole 34'8" (59th), 85.7 % scrambling (1st), 1.65 putts per GIR (4th). 2015, Chris Kirk (-12). 277 yards (41st), 50.0% fairways (60th), 63.9% greens in regulation (62nd), proximity to hole 33'9" (57th), 61.5 % scrambling (39th), 1.57 putts per GIR (1st).

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

That includes a win at the Farmers Insurance Open two weeks back and a 5th at the Australian Open in late November. Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top.
Day  ->  positive

-- Jeff Bergerson  Tony Finau  Finau rates out almost perfectly for this course and should be a match-play stud given his aggressiveness, but as always his putter is the main issue. He's the longest golfer on the tour (ranked in driving distance, he's eighth in all drives) and ranks 39th in strokes gained off the tee, thanks to his atrocious accuracy -- Finau hits the fairway only 52.39 percent of the time. His short iron play would seem to need work as he's only minus-6 on approach shots between 50 and 125 yards, but for a long hitter he's actually been hitting woods and irons off the tee a bit more; Finau's taken only 51 shots between 50 and 125 yards.
Finau  ->  positive

Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
Walker  ->  positive

This was after opening the week with a five-over round of 77. Had Harman have just shot level par on the opening day (he broke par in each of the last three rounds), he would have finish in a tie for 2nd. It was a similar story in 2016, when Harman finished T17, as Harman finished two shots shy of the three players who were tied for 9th.
Harman  ->  positive

All selections are 1/5 odds, with 6 places being paid across both tours this week. Pablo Larrazabal 100-1  Chris Hanson 100-1  Poom Saksansin 125-1  Phachara Khongwatmai 150-1    Harris English 55-1  Brendan Steele 66-1  Webb Simpson 45-1  Adam Hadwin 66-1  ADVERTISEMENT  *16 x 0.15 ew doubles = total 4.8 points*  Whilst they’ve only played one Maybank at Saujana in it’s current guise, even those with the longest memories are aware that the top-five are often those that can think their way round, shape shots both ways, and avoid bogeys above making eagles. Players such as Jaidee, Jimenez and Levet crop up from past years, and although the 2016 version was played at Royal Selangor, those close behind winner Marcus Fraser were short-track players Quesne and Larrazabal.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Waste Management Phoenix Open / Maybank Championship and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Emiliano Grillo / Steve Stricker; 3) Vaughn Taylor; 4) Ryan Blaum; 5) Ryan Moore; 6) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Jim Furyk; 8) Brian Harman / Martin Laird; 10) Adam Hadwin; 11) Chad Campbell; 12) David Hearn / Kevin Streelman; 14) Francesco Molinari; 15) Michael Thompson; 16) Kevin Kisner; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Fabian Gomez; 19) Russell Knox; 20) Tyrrell Hatton.

Brian Harman  ->  positive

Should he find something on the greens this week, that he has struggled to so far this season, Johnson could well be in contention come Sunday. Despite his struggles on the green, Johnson does still rank 30th in Par 5 Scoring Average this season, and that will help him here. He also ranks 9th in Scrambling, which can be even better once the putter clicks.
Johnson  ->  positive

He’s accurate off the tee and rarely ends up in any deep trouble, missing both the fairway and rough 2.26% of the time (14 ), and just needs a few decent rounds with the putter to contend. Russell Henley ($7100) : Henley could conceivably show up in this article every week if he’s priced cheaply enough or the field is strong enough, and luckily that’s the case this week. Henley isn’t the best golfer on approach or around the greens, but he’s above average in hitting both fairways (59 th ) and greens (20 th ) and has had a lights out putter all year.
Henley  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us. Any further examination of his resume is unnecessary at this point, maybe even insulting.
Spieth  ->  positive

Length is I think a big part of playing out here. As for current form, Finau has been in fine fettle since the second half of last season. After a top five in Canada, his final six starts of 2017 read: 7-7-2-26-11-16.
Finau  ->  positive

And getting climatized to thelast week only will work in his favor. Alex Noren  While the irons finally cooled off from their elite levels at Riviera, Noren still managed to pick up a stroke on the field, leaving sixth in Strokes Gained: Approach over the past 12 rounds. Now he’ll tackle a layout that should suit his eye far better, especially if the conditions get wet and windy.
Noren  ->  positive

3rd at the CIMB Classic and 2nd in the KJ Choi Invitational both in October shouts value to me and there are other strong points I really like this week. 50th in Birdie Average and 18th in Putting from 5-15 feet in the embryonic PGA Tour statistics tell a story and Kang's record at El Camaleon specifically and in Mexico in general is interesting. Opening rounds of 67-67 placed Kang in 2nd place here after 36 holes on course debut way back in 2011 and he was still 6th going into the final round.
Kang's  ->  positive

It is tough to see Hughes wining twice in his first full season on Tour but I think he represents good value at 225/1, as he has proved he is suited to these sort of courses already this season. Luke Donald to finish in the top-10 7/1 (BetVictor) 2pts  Donald was 200/1 to win last week at the Genesis Open, so despite his good week I am not that inclined to take him at 70/1 this week. It is important to remember that Donald has not won anywhere since 2013 (Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan) and not won in America since the Transitions Championship (now Valspar Championship) in 2012.
Donald  ->  positive

Pat Perez ($7600): Perez is an interesting play this week, given he’s very reasonably priced at only $7600 and finished T5 in 2015, but the rest of his course history is rather ugly (a MC, WD, and finishes in the 60s) and he doesn’t check every statistical box. That being said, Perez has been excellent this year out of the rough (40’2” to the pin, 22nd) and is great with a short iron in his hand, and like Ollie is better (relatively) outside 10’ than inside. On missed greens Perez has been excellent at getting up and down, which will play a factor with the small size of the greens – 35th in Scrambling% (63.04%), 13th in SG: ARG.
Perez  ->  positive

Early in the week, these guys are on my FADE LIST, but that may change when salaries come out. Might dabble in Bubba and/or Furyk if the price is right but I think Charl and Knox are fades for me. TUESDAY UPDATE: Was expecting a much higher salary for Furyk.
Furyk  ->  negative

Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75. He’s an excellent play this week.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

That could be with Keegan Bradley, who is playing well, has good course history, and is normally under-priced and under owned. Bill Haas is another cash game king who seems normally have a good price to value ratio. Our team of experts at Hammer DFS will not only teach and coach, but will provide quality lineups throughout the entire golf season.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

He trails only Matsuyama and Chez Reavie with his 19.5 Recent Birdie Average. Ross Fisher: I’ll leave some really contrarian picks for Kelly’s Five Under Five piece on Wednesday, but I do want to highlight Fisher, who is currently projected at just five to eight percent ownership. He’s an excellent play — his 304.6-yard Recent DD is good enough, and he came in 10th last time he played Quail Hollow — and non-PGA members could be undervalued.
Ross Fisher:  ->  positive

Many will expect him to struggle overcoming the dissapointment of last year, but given his excellent mental strength, I have no doubts he can pick himself up and have a chance for the third time in four years. In an interview with The Telegraph, Rose was quoted saying “It definitely makes me more likely to win, not less likely,” Rose said. “Look at how the runners-up have done in recent years.
Rose  ->  positive

At only $8,800, he’s a golfer to keep your eye on in the swing season and is a great value this week on DK. MY SLEEPER : Aaron Wise ($7,100)  Wise is one of the new Web.com grads teeing it up this week on the PGA. The 21-year-old enjoyed a storied college career and has seamlessly worked his way into a full PGA membership for 2017, with wins on the Mackenzie Tour and Web.com Tour over the past year or so.
Wise  ->  positive

Importantly he had also shown the ability to be able to play at altitude with 4th in Mexico and 2nd at Highland Springs CC in Missouri across 2015. 2014 winner Ben Martin had already finished 6th at Montreux in 2011 and other more straight-forward winners like Simpson, Na, Moore and Byrd all had top 8 finishes at TPC Scottsdale prior to winning this. Bookmaker Offers : Latest offers and extended each-way places are detailed below.
Simpson,  ->  positive

He doesn’t excel in the shorter approach range, but he’s still sticking the ball an average of just under 19’ from the pin, and with overall good putting numbers he’ll be able to stick some birdies. After finally getting his first win, look for Kisner to try and keep that going at a birdie-fest which is exactly where he plays his best. The “choker” label was shedded at the Dean & DeLuca, and this par-4 stud should be able to post a score of at least -16 over four days which may not end up winning but will be a great DK score and necessary in a winning lineup in a weak field.
Kisner  ->  positive

However, in a weak field like this, you are forced to roster golfers in cash that you wouldn’t necessarily do in stronger fields. Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring.
Finau  ->  positive

Hudson Swafford at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - confidence growing after maiden win this year and local ties a boost  1pt e.w. Patrick Cantlay at 100/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - chance now to show off a rare talent and eyecatching form in Florida  Click here for our transparent tipping record. There have been one or two head-scratching results at the PLAYERS Championship down the years but proven top-level form from an established star or a rapid improver has been the general order of the day.
Patrick Cantlay  ->  positive

Not liking a four-time winner of the event while he’s in form would be odd, no? Sleeper: Nick Watney. He boasts a strong record here (three top 10s) and it seems he’s rounding into form.
Nick Watney.  ->  positive

His good friend, Harry Diamond, will take over the reins for now so all we can do is wait and see but in the short term at least, from a punting perspective, yet another disruption has to be viewed as a negative. Selections  I was more than happy to take a small chance on Spieth and I'm also playing course debutant, Tommy Fleetwood, whose game has improved inexorably this year. Fleetwood finished 27th at the Open Championship two weeks ago and that was a disappointing effort given the form he's been in and that Birdkdale's his local links but I think that second fact was the big problem.
Tommy Fleetwood,  ->  positive

He's never finished better than T15 there anyway. We saw Webb Simpson - like Bradley, another recent major champ who has had to come to terms with the new putter rule - come within an inch of winning at TPC Scottsdale so it's fair to presume these hugely talented players who tasted big success early have more wins in them. Getting Bradley at 80/1 is a bonus.
Bradley,  ->  positive

Fortunately for Kevin, he’s having his best year on Tour with six top-6 finishes and 16/19 made cuts – including last week at the Greenbrier, which might (fingers crossed) help guide people towards someone like Daniel Berger instead. Kisner fits the model for this course almost to a tee, as a shorter hitter that finds a lot of fairways (12th) and excellent proximity/strokes gained numbers on approach. He doesn’t excel in the shorter approach range, but he’s still sticking the ball an average of just under 19’ from the pin, and with overall good putting numbers he’ll be able to stick some birdies.
Kisner  ->  positive

In the upper tier of DK pricing this week, he makes a nice pivot off DJ and Kuchar who are most likely more popular. Chad Campbell  World Golf Ranking (#161)  Vegas Odds (50/1)  Draftkings ($7,500)  FanDuel ($6,800)    Looking at some value for the form section, Chad Campbell is the first name that pops up. He is a four-time PGA Tour winner that hasn't won since the 2007 Viking Classic but is playing some of his best golf of this season right now.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

He is not in bad form at all, so 14/1 is plenty fair enough and I am happy to make him pick of the week here. Day has drawn Louis Oosthuizen, Jason Dufner and James Hahn in his group, and whilst this certainly could have been an easier draw, it doesn’t change my mind about his winning chances. He’s already proven he can beat Oosthuizen whilst Dufner and Hahn are unpredictable players, who of course can get hot, but in this format, I’ll take Day every time.
Day  ->  positive

He has made nine straight cuts this year. Casey has historically played well at Pete Dye courses, but had struggled at TPC Sawgrass before his 23rd place finish last year. Jhonnatan Vegas ($7,300) has made 6-of-7 cuts.
Casey  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin: Hadwin has only played here twice, but he hasn’t finished worse than 22nd in either appearance. Hadwin’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score is 10th, his 60.6 LT SC percentage is 19th, and his 14.4 LT Adj Bird Avg ranks ninth in the field. Pat Perez: With zero missed cuts and seven top-25 finishes in 2017, Perez comes into this event in fabulous form.
Hadwin:  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. The aforementioned DJ is the model’s top golfer, but Matt Kuchar is this week’s Levitanimal. While his Saturday meltdown and 39.0-point DraftKings MDF performance at THE PLAYERS are off-putting, the numbers don’t lie.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Even in this strong field, Vegas has him at 6-1 while no other golfer is better than 11-1. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  Another golfer sure to be widely owned, Rickie Fowler remains a solid GPP play due to his strong track record and penchant for birdies (fifth on Tour in BoB%). He arrives in good form with 16th-or-better finishes in six of his last seven starts.
Rickie Fowler:  ->  positive

My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest. So much is about momentum at this time of year and while plenty of the field are going the wrong way, the Englishman is coming on strong.
Spieth  ->  positive

According to our Research Station, Reavie is number 1 in field adjusted driving accuracy of any player priced over $9000 on FanDuel. Other stats also look promising as Reavie has been gaining strokes approaching the green and putting once field adjusted. Ownership level will be an issue as you will have to decide what to do for GPP’s while in cash games Reavie is looking like an early lock.
Reavie  ->  positive

7th here in 2014, wind and a soft course are the kind of conditions where Ryan truly comes to the fore. RESULT: MC  Bud Cauley 0.5pt EW 200/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  Bud Cauley has always been an aggressive sort whose tee-to-green game can be very effective. He performs better at low-scoring tests and his record here reads 8th in 2012 (on debut) and 16th in 2013.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

He finished T27 at The Masters at the end of April and followed that with a T11 at the RBC Heritage, a T10 in Texas and a respectable T24 in New Orleans. Grace is the kind of player that has proven he can really tough it out on the stiffer US Open tests with two top 10’s over the last two years. He finished T5 last year in Oakmont and came close to winning in Chambers Bay in 2015 but pulled his tee shot left on the 16th out of bounds which ended up costing him a double bogey.
Grace  ->  positive

Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season. Rickie Fowler, $11900 – The flashy Fowler has lived up to his hype at the electric TPC Scottsdale, finishing fourth and second the last two years.
Rahm,  ->  positive

He has done well at PGA National, with top-15s in three of the past four years. Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago.
Garcia  ->  positive

The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East. Fleetwood beat a field including Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson to land the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and while that event does tend to see the favourites come up short on what’s typically their first start in months, this year’s winner is good enough to use victory as a springboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time.
Fleetwood  ->  positive

So far this season Johnson has been even better, averaging an incredible 93.29 PPT and +14.3 Plus/Minus with a highly desirable 71 percent Consistency Rating. In 58 tournaments since 2014, Johnson has averaged 81.13 PPT and a +7.54 Plus/Minus with 65.5 percent Consistency. During that time he has been owned at an average of 29.0 percent in large-field mid-stakes DraftKings tournaments.
Johnson  ->  positive

Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
Harrington  ->  positive

I think he’ll be low owned and could pay off big time. Here is a LU I entered into the PGA $200K Birdie on Draft Kings:  Walker $9,900  Snedeker $9,700  Dufner $7,700  Kisner $7,400  McGirt $7,900  Tanihara $6,400    Leaving $1,000 on the table to play with. Best of luck!
Dufner  ->  positive

Russell Henley ($8200): 16th in Bogey Avoidance is a good place to start for the Georgia native, who’s been having an excellent year on Tour – 1st at the Shell Houston Open, and top-10s at Valspar and the RSM – and should easily continue that here. Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour.
Henley  ->  positive

Koepka came to life at the WGC-Dell Match Play, where he told reporters he’d figured things out en route to a share of ninth, before improving his score each day for 11th place in the Masters. Augusta National is no place to discover a game so it strikes me that Koepka’s claim that everything clicked at Bay Hill is accurate, and he can soon put the first three months of the season behind him and lift what would be his second PGA Tour title. A missed cut here last year would be a slight concern but he was just a single shot off the mark and had shown promise on his sole previous visit, so I’m more than happy to give him the benefit of the doubt and back up my suspicion that the course plays to his strengths.
Koepka’s  ->  positive

Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency. His good run of form began back in January where he finished T4 at the windy Waialae Country Club, home of the Sony Open.
Kevin Kisner  ->  positive

Deploy at will. Jon Rahm ($9,200) – There were certainly some chinks in the armor last week, but Rahm’s ability to still put up a respectable four rounds despite not having a birdie on a Par 5 until Sunday just showcases exactly how talented this guy is. He has the requisite power to handle the significant length of this golf course, and if he can keep the tee shots reasonably under control, he’s certainly a good bet for a high finish.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

After getting through to the final of the WGC Match Play, Kisner was well beaten in the final, by Bubba Watson who was not going to be denied. Last week though, Kisner teed it up at Augusta, where he had made the cut on his first two starts, but couldn’t crack the top-30 (T37-T43). This time though, he finished a respectable T28, largely thanks to a Saturday 69 on a course that he really shouldn’t be expected to perform well on.
Kisner  ->  positive

First and foremost, Snedeker is very good when he does get a sniff. Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun.
Kisner,  ->  positive

The Off the Tee numbers aren’t nearly as terrifying as they would be otherwise, because his lack of distance (291.6) and struggles with accuracy (59.35%) will be mitigated by the way the course sets up. By taking driver out of his hand, Spieth will be able to either use long irons or woods off the tee, and figures to find the fairway higher than his 2017 average. On approach, Spieth is elite in every sense of the word.
Spieth  ->  positive

In addition to his win in 2015, Walker has posted 3rd, 13th, and 16th place finishes here at TPC San Antonio. Last we saw of Walker, he posted three straight rounds under par at Augusta to finish inside the top-20. Walker bombs it off-the-tee, plays well in the wind and is a great putter.
Walker  ->  positive

The week after the CJ Cup, Kang stayed in his homeland for the KJ Choi Invitational played at Jeongsan Country Club. A stunning final round -6/66 placed Kang in a play-off where across a 4-hole marathon he was eventually beaten into 2nd place. So I was surprised to see such a good price about the talented 30 year-old who sits at an interesting 78th in the OWGR.
Kang  ->  positive

Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016. At 66th in the PGA Tour Driving Distance stats, Phil has taken an average of 6 yards off of his driving to hit more fairways in a bid to hit far more greens.
Mickelson  ->  positive

I have a feeling he will be chalky, but I will look to differentiate elsewhere and keep my rose exposure. Jordan Spieth ($11,100) – We all know how well Jordan plays at Augusta every year and this is an Augusta-like course in Texas. Where is Jordan Spieth from – Texas.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

Burmester should be comfortable in altitude and also comfy with kikuyugrass which is featured tee-to-green here. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 370.5  Last Week Rank: 144  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Tony Finau ($14,700)  Phil Mickelson ($14,600)  Patrick Cantlay ($14,400)  Bubba Watson ($10,900)  Jason Dufner ($10,100)    Analysis: Loads of success on poa annua greens with this lineup. Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Now lengthened to 7,600 yards and the threat of storms making the fairways softer, that advantage could be exaggerated. Matsuyama sits a very healthy 22nd in Driving Distance and should also benefit from the course switching all 18 greens from Bentgrass to Bermuda. On the Future of Fantasy website which measures performances on various putting surfaces since 2014, Matsuyama ranks seventh (2.25 Strokes Gained) and he won on such greens in Phoenix (for the second time) earlier this season.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Streelman ranks 12th in Par 4 Scoring, 23rd in SG:T2G and Scrambling, and 24th in BoB%. Chad Campbell ($7,900) – Campbell has been playing solid golf and making cuts. Continue to ride the form until it loses steam.
Chad Campbell  ->  positive

The results of events following a major tend to be fairly wide open because of the weaker base of players playing in these events. The first potential value that stands out on this chart is Patrick Rodgers who has roughly 60:1 odds to win this week despite a mere $7,000 price tag. The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat.
Patrick Rodgers  ->  positive

While it’s often good to take a wait-and-see approach with golfers, Wise is someone I would not recommend waiting too long on as his pedigree suggests he won’t take long to adapt to his next level of competition. The course this week does seem to award aggressive play, which works in Wise’s favor as he is plenty long off the tee (averaged over 315 yards per drive) and ranked first in eagles made and 14th in birdies made last season on the Web.com Tour. At just $7,100, he makes for a solid tournament pick this week and is a golfer to track as we progress through the seven-week swing season.
Wise  ->  positive

Throw in his wildness off the tee -- a shortcoming that's severely penalized at the Greenbrier -- and I'm staying away. Expert Picks  Kevin Kisner  Danny Lee  Keegan Bradley  Bill Haas  Patrick Reed  Sung Kang  Gary Woodland  Xander Schauffele  Webb Simpson  Russell Henley  Pinterest Icon Sportswire  Expert Explanation : Does Kisner even need rationale? Kisner has six top-10 finishes on the season, and was a runner-up the last time this event was played.
Bill Haas  ->  positive

However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278. Both Chappell and Kirk fit the course profile, so it comes down to current form for me as the final tiebreaker.
Kirk's  ->  positive

The Memorial Tournament is always a highlight of the PGA Tour as its Invitational status, combined with its positioning close to the second Major Championship, guarantees a high class field. 2018 doesn't disappoint with Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Henrik Stenson and 5 times Memorial winner Tiger Woods all in attendance. In all, 11 of the World's top-16 ranked players are in Dublin, Ohio this week.
Rickie Fowler,  ->  positive

He’s a sneaky pick to possibly pick up the win here too. Bud Cauley ($7,500): Cauley is coming off a missed cut at the US Open but that really shouldn’t bug us too much as players missing the cut there have often bounced back here with big weeks. Cauley actually led this event after round one in 2014 and he’s proven to be a much more consistent player this year with injury issues behind him.
Cauley  ->  positive

I'm e/w on D Lee, Cejka &amp; Weekley (long shot) in Puerto Rico this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
Weekley  ->  positive

Missed event last year but Firestone looks ideal for this long, straight driver. Daniel Berger makes his belated debut at Firestone having withdrawn on the eve of the tournament twelve months ago and on paper it is a course that should suit him. At Firestone you need to drive it long and relatively straight, which is fine for Berger who ranks 37th for strokes gained off the tee.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance. What makes Scott an elite golfer and always in contention is his game on the way to the greens, as he’s a longer hitter off the tee with an average drive of 302, and hits good drives 84.4% of the time.
Scott  ->  positive

7. Jordan Spieth - Spieth's just kind of been hanging around for the last couple of months, not doing anything particularly impressive. He should be charged for this run, however.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion.
Fowler's  ->  positive

Had DJ gone on to win last year, four of the ten BMW winners would have doubled up here and Leishman reminds me of two of the three winners that have doubled up since the tournament became the FedEx Cup finale...    Villegas had form figures reading 21-3-1 before doubling up here in 2008 and Horschel's read MC-2-1 in 2014. Leishman's read MC-3-1 and he has a similar profile to the other too as well. None of the three can be described as prolific but it's perfectly possible that Leishman can give it one last push and replicate Villegas and Horschel.
Leishman  ->  positive

He missed the cut, but I can see enough correlating course form with the likes of Danny Lee and Jonas Blixt to suggest that he'll love the test this week. A web.com Tour runner-up finish in 2011 at Midland Country Club in Texas at altitude was behind the New Zealander and English has finished 3rd at TPC Scottsdale in 2016 where he beat Danny Lee into 4th spot. It's also worth remembering that Harris has a 5th (2012) and 2nd (2016) to his name at Colonial and won the 2013 OHL Classic at El Camaleon - 2 courses where Lee has also finished 6th (Colonial 2017) and 3rd (El Camaleon 2014).
English  ->  positive

Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course. Hadwin is playable in all formats this week.
Hadwin  ->  positive

Add in 1st in Driving Distance, 1st for Greens In Regulation and 21st in Scrambling and he really is the complete package. One hugely important factor at the Masters - and this is the final clincher with Johnson - is being able to avoid the big numbers. Check out the Bogey Avoidance stats for this season and you'll see DJ in fifth place.
DJ  ->  positive

This section is going to detail a few of the players who have the best fantasy value comparative to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Brandt Snedeker 51-1 $7,700 Gary Woodland $7400 and 67-1  Sean O’Hair $7800 and 80-1  Paul Casey $7900 and 80-1 Steve Stricker 90-1 $7,000 Jamie Lovemark$7200 and 125-1  John Senden $7200 and 150-1  Si Woo Kim $7300 and 110-1  HORSES FOR COURSES  Phil Mickelson loves being aggressive and this course has suited him well in the past. Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and has a 10th and 4th in his past 5 visits.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Billy Horschel - Billy Horschel hasn’t looked sharp since the Arnold Palmer, but he still has four top-25 finishes and was tied for fourth at the Honda Classic. Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average. The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open.
Horschel  ->  positive

Riviera hasn’t been a place where players suddenly “find their games” and as the sort main event of the West Coast swing, emphasizing players who have performed well at the previous few events is not a bad idea. Stud Picks  Dustin Johnson ($11,400): Hard to argue with Dustin at all this week. Some point to Pebble Beach as his favorite course but this venue might actually suit him better.
Dustin  ->  positive

We love him in GPPs! Player to avoid  Patrick Reed $9,800 – You’ve got to fade someone in this top tier on DraftKings, and Reed is the logical choice simply due to form. He did flash a little at the Zurich this past week, but he hasn’t had a top 25 since Pebble Beach in February.
Reed  ->  negative

He seems slightly under-priced for whatever reason, so nabbing him here provides solid value as he owns a promising chance at a top-five finish. Mid-Tier Glue Guys  Chris Kirk - $15,500  Kyle Stanley - $15,200  Sung Kang - $15,000  Lucas Glover - $14,400    Cash-game Target: With just one missed cut in his last 12 events, Stanley’s ball striking has bumped him inside the top 40 of the FedExCup standings. He ranks top-six on Tour in SG: off-the-tee, SG: approach-the-green, and SG: tee-to-green while placing second in terms of GIR percentage at 73.08%.
Chris Kirk  ->  positive

2. Webb Simpson -- Simpson is the ultimate horse for this course. He is a past winner and loves playing in his home state.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Fresh off a week in which he finished T-17 on a course that didn't exactly suit his game, Donald should be licking his chops to get back to the friendly confines of Florida. Bob Harig: Adam Scott ($12,200)  The defending Honda Classic champion has not finished worse than a tie for 14th in 10 of his past 11 starts worldwide. But he hasn't won during that stretch, either, lurking along ranked seventh in the world.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

The PGA Tour hops down from Las Vegas to Mexico, in the Cancun area, for the OHL Classic at Mayakoba. El Camaleon hosts again, with Graeme McDowell defending the title he somewhat surprisingly won last year in a playoff against Russell Knox and Jason Bohn. For GNN Plus subscribers, you can access our NEW searchable database of PGA Tour results from 2011-present, our top-15 finish chart and season-long trends on DraftKings valuations.
Jason Bohn.  ->  positive

We want to target the golfers with the highest BoB% as that is where you can really accumulate points. Core Plays  Adam Scott ($16,600) – Love the way Scott has been playing lately. He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Ryan Moore 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  At the sharp end of the betting, Ryan Moore has plenty to play for this week with the Presidents Cup team announced in only 3 weeks time. At 18th in the current United States team standings, Moore must know that he needs to put his foot to the floor over the next 3 weeks to get into Steve Stricker's thinking, but a pot full of points from last season's Tour Championship at East Lake where he finished runner-up to Rory McIlroy in turn grabbing Davis Love III's last Ryder Cup spot, plus the 3rd at this year's Tournament of Champions at Kapalua and 9th at The Masters, means that the Nevada man is still in touch with the likes of Matt Kuchar and Charley Hoffman when it comes to automatic qualification. A win this week at a course where he grabbed his maiden PGA Tour victory in 2009 would be ever so sweet and it's certainly not beyond the realms of possibility.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

What you do off the tee is largely irrelevant at Waialae. Only two players in the top-12 ranked inside the top-ten for Driving Distance last year and the first thee home, Fabian Gomez, Brandt Snedeker and Zac Blair, ranked 27th, 21st and 58th for DD. Despite it being quite tight off the tee, Driving Accuracy hasn't been a key stat in recent years either though.
Fabian Gomez,  ->  positive

On the year, Reavie’s had some fantastic finishes including a T8 in the strong Sony Open field, but no Top-25s since January will help keep him slide under the radar. Reavie is another shorter hitter that’s deadly accurate (11th in Accuracy %) which has led him to a great Par-4 Scoring rank of 32nd (4.01) – he’s also great on Par-3s at 18th (3.00) but will struggle on the par-5s because of that lack of distance. With it being a par-70, the par-5 scoring won’t be an impactful loss.
Reavie’s  ->  positive

For a player so consistent, that's an alarmingly poor return and the hope is Haas can step up a level now out on the coast at Eagle Point, which he describes as 'a fantastic golf course' and one he knows fairly well - albeit not quite so well as Simpson. But being member at a course is too easily mistaken for being suited to a course, and while Simpson did outperform Haas at the Heritage last time, that's another event in which Haas has struggled to perform for some time and his overall play in 2017 is on a much higher level. Prior to missing the cut at Harbour Town, he'd extended his flawless Augusta record with an eighth cut made from eight starts there, having previously reached the semi-finals of the WGC-Match Play in Texas.
Haas  ->  positive

Rory, Rahm and Henley for me this week. Will look at the specials later in the week and likely add to these. #Masters #AugustaNational
Henley  ->  positive

However the wrap-around season can clearly help to re-balance the equation with Brian earning 3 pay cheques across 3 outings. 4th on his beloved Bermudagrass greens at the Sanderson Farms Championship was powered by 18 birdies (8th best in the field) and Stuard was also in the mix last week in Las Vegas where a Saturday round of -2/69 placed the Fort Worth, Texas resident into 10th spot come Sunday. 4th in my 10-week Greens in Regulation tracker and 18th in the embryonic PGA Tour ball-striking category, Brian is playing some great stuff from tee-to-green right now and that could be perfect as he arrives at a course where he has finished runner-up twice in both 2011 and 2013, placing in the top 10 for Putts per Round on both occasions.
Brian  ->  positive

Playing him in the late rounds on FanDuel may be a viable contrarian strategy, as most owners will choose to load up on Spieth, Johnson, or McIlroy in the late rounds. Oh Rickie, You’re So Fine  With recently increased odds to win, Rickie Fowler is seemingly trending in the right direction. Fowler missed the cut at last year’s Masters, but he had 12th- and fifth-place finishes in the two years prior.
Fowler  ->  positive

Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th). His putting will need to improve this week, but Augusta greens are a different challenge than anything the South African has faced this season and he knows exactly what to expect of them, after eight starts here.
Oosthuizen  ->  positive

Players To Watch  It wasn’t that long ago when Rory McIlroy just rolled out of bed and woke up awesome. After McIlroy won the FedEx Cup last year, expectations for 2017 were justifiably sky-high. So far this season has been a painful disappointment for Rory however, as he’s battled injury and generally been searching for his best form.
McIlroy  ->  negative

Bryson is a great lower salaried play for salary relief. Wesley Bryan (Draftkings – $6,200, Fanduel – $7,300)  Wesley is a free square here. On Draftkings, he comes in at the third lowest salaried player and that is just a mistake.
Wesley  ->  positive

He was in contention last week at Kapalua before finishing tied for ninth, where he also had a top-10 a year ago. Michael Collins: Spieth ($11,500)  Seeing as he's never played the Sony Open before, the term "ignorance is bliss" comes to mind. This type of course is completely opposite to what he played last week at Kapalua.
Spieth  ->  positive

Greens in Regulation : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Russell Knox; 3) Brendan Steele; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Branden Grace / Bubba Watson; 8) Justin Thomas / Jhonattan Vegas; 10) Daniel Berger; 11) William McGirt; 12) Ryan Moore.

Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Looks like a good time to jump back on. Justin Rose – $8,400  Hear me out for a second. No, Justin Rose didn’t necessarily burn you last week, but you could say he underwhelmed.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

He was 17th last week in a 34-man field, but that does mean that he played in Hawaii a week ago. In Henley's three top-17s, he gained strokes on the field tee-to-green. In his poor performances, he lost strokes tee to green.
Henley's  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Farmers Insurance Open. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brian Harman ($9,600)  Harman continues to play at a ridiculously high level. After five straight top-10 finishes, his streak snapped last week with a 20th at the CareerBuilder.
Harman  ->  positive

With the way things have been going for the rookie, I would have no issues running him out in cash games this week and is definitely in play for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($7,300)  I am not quite sure what Hadwin needs to do in order to get a bump in his salary up to the level to where his play has been in recent weeks, but at $7,300, he is a tremendous bargain in a weaker field this week. Hadwin has been a top-notch putter throughout his PGA career, but the leap this year in his play has come from his approach game, where his short to mid-range iron play has improved dramatically, making him a great fit for the course.
Hadwin  ->  positive

MacKenzie now lives in Jupiter, Florida, but the others have stayed put or moved to South Carolina or nearby Georgia (Love). Jason Kokrak is a Charlotte resident and others that now reside in the state include rank outsiders, Brad Fritsch, Chad Collins and Johnson Wagner but the three players in the field that require particular attention are frequent course visitor, Bill Haas, and Eagle Point members Webb Simpson and Carl Pettersson...  Simpson, who was born here, went to college here and who still lives here, tweeted back in March "I learned to play golf at Eagle Point. It'll be pretty special to play a PGA Tour event there in May.
Simpson  ->  positive

He could be interesting at 125s. Shock Pebble Beach star Ted Potter Jr (125s) could ride the wave while Koreans KJ Choi (T26 at Pebble and brilliant record here including T5 in 2016) and Players Championship winner Si Woo Kim (68 in R2 last year despite MC) could also feature. Back up the price grid and Brendan Steele at 50s is a decent price in his home State and on greens he grew up on and I really like Alex Noren on this course which is perfect for his left-to-right ball flight but we've really ducked him at 35s.
Si Woo Kim  ->  positive

Lastly, Thomas ranks T13 in SG: Approach-the-Green this season, another key stat this week. There is not much else to say about Thomas really, he has been one of the standout performers of the season, despite getting each of his three wins early on and he can get back to his very best again this week. Since his last win in Hawaii, he does have three missed cuts in seven starts, but he did also post a T5 at the WGC in Mexico and finished T22 at Augusta, on his individual last start.
Thomas  ->  positive

Chris Kirk, $8,700 – Kirk posted a convincing fourth place at the RSM Classic in his last PGA Tour start, where he shot rounds of 63 and 64 in the first and third rounds. Though his consistency has been a bit sporadic, Kirk should feel comfortable on a track where he’s two top-5s and 5-of-7 cuts since 2011. Strategy Tips for this week (based on 60k standard salary cap)    With FanDuel’s new six-player lineups this year (instead of eight), it’s more important than ever to make careful selections to ensure at least five of your guys make the cut.
Kirk,  ->  positive

All said, it’s quite likely we’ll see another decorated champion take the trophy this week, so try to fit in as many top-ranked players as you can in your lineup(s). FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Dustin Johnson, $12800 – Johnson is an absolute powerhouse who deserves all the accolades that come with being World No. 1 for an extended period.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Play That Song  No, not Young-Han Song, I’m talking about Mr. DJ: Dustin Johnson ($11,400). Johnson has racked up five top-five finishes at Riviera since 2010 and in his three most recent trips has finished fourth once and second twice. DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Lets go with 5/1 Aphibarnrat as well. #top20
Aphibarnrat  ->  positive

Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play.
Casey’s  ->  positive

The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips.
Rory McIlroy  ->  positive

Justin Rose, $12200 – Local resident Rose enters as perhaps the hottest player in the world with three straight top-8 finishes on TOUR. When you pair that with his eight top-15’s at Bay Hill in 12 career starts, Rose becomes a foolproof option this week. Tiger Woods, $11900 – Tiger’s resurgence the last two weeks has gotten golf plenty of good PR, but this week it may hit even higher levels at the storied Bay Hill, where Tiger has dramatically won on many occasions.
Rose,  ->  positive

He could also only manage a T50 finish in his season opener, the Safeway Open. So why do I like the winless and seemingly inconsistent, Cauley this week? Well firstly the T3 finish last week is a huge factor.
Cauley  ->  positive

Pat Perez – $6,800  Now this is a perfect price for Pat Perez. The last couple of events he saw Perez’s price tag creep a little high for my liking, even though he was still playing well and the course fit his game. Now we can roster Perez without the expectation of a T15 and be pleasantly surprised when it happens.
Perez  ->  positive

He’s one of my favorite targets this week on DraftKings and a player you shouldn’t overlook based his sub-par results from earlier in the year. My Value: Marc Leishman ($6,700)  Leishman has had a strong season by any standard thus far as the Aussie picked up his second career win on the PGA this year at the tough Bay Hill CC, and has also amassed a total of seven top-25 finishes in 13 starts so far. The former rookie of the year may finally be ready to reach his full potential this season and has looked solid over his last few starts.

Among these golfers, those who are less than $7,000 could have low ownership: Check out these results from our Trends tool for golfers with salaries under $7,000 and LT Adj Rd Scores between 69.5 and 70.5:  As you can see, the golfers who met the criteria for this trend have been owned at an average of under three percent (with a positive Plus/Minus). This week, several golfers with great LT Adj Rd Scores and low salaries are available: Stewart Cink (who looks like the value chalk play this week), Chad Campbell, and Luke List. Both Campbell and List are tied for 15th in the field with their 69.8 LT Adj Rd Scores.
Chad Campbell,  ->  positive

Other: Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Francesco Molinari, Phil Mickelson, Kyle Stanley, Kevin Chappell, Russell Henley, Russell Knox, Stewart Cink, Ricky Barnes  – Charl Schwartzel, Harold Varner III, Peter Uihlein, Sam Saunders, Chez Reavie, Danny Lee, Smylie Kaufman  Bets:  Kyle Stanley 40-1  Peter Uihlein 60-1 ew  Stewart Cink 70-1 ew  Harold Varner III 80-1 ew  Ricky Barnes 200-1 ew  Chez Reavie 160-1 ew  San Saunders 200-1 ew He should be able to bounce back here and is capable of taking advantage of a weaker field to post a top ten finish. Last week he gained strokes on the field in approaches over three rounds, but had a terrible back nine on Sunday.
Kevin Chappell,  ->  positive

Between 2009 and 2011 he finished 17th, 18th and 30th and Justin Rose comments when interviewed after the BMW Championship yesterday interested me. Rose, who has a great record here, told Sky's Nick Dougherty that he often finds himself in-the-mix at the same events as Leishman as they both have similar games so what's good for Justin could well be good for Marc. Leishman's Driving Accuracy figures are a slight concern but in his last two starts he's ranked second and fifth for GIR and fourth and second for Putting Average so he really is playing the best golf of his career.
Leishman  ->  positive

Two top ten finishes then he missed the cut at Farmers Insurance Open and here he is where he was 41st last year, 4th in 2015 and 2nd in 2014. B:  Jordan Spieth. 16th in FedEx Cup ranking right now, 4 consecutive top ten finishes, his last three years at AT&T Pebble Beach - 21st, 7th and 4th.
Jordan Spieth.  ->  positive

Length of the tee is advantageous and historically much more important than accuracy but it isn't an absolute imperative. The two winners before Sergio, Jordan Spieth and Danny Willett, only ranked 52nd and 32nd respectively for DD. Greens In Regulation and Scrambling are the most important stats to consider and nobody wins at Augusta unless they have a good week with the putter.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He has a terrific short game and he might just finish in front of Rory. If forced to pick one, I'd go for Lowry but I'd rather just take on McIlroy at [1.5] or shorter one the market materialises for modest stakes. Recommended Wagers  Russell Knox @ 11/8 (Sportsbook)  Lay Rory McIlroy Top Irish @ [1.5] or shorter    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
McIlroy  ->  positive

Sea Island is home to a growing percentage of PGA Tour professionals these days, which means plenty of guys in this week's field will be sleeping in their own beds. I'll take Johnson, who hasn't won since last year's Open Championship but should be due for another title soon. Michael Collins -- Matt Kuchar ($11,200)  In the five times he has played this event, he has never finished outside the top 25.
Johnson,  ->  positive

Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge. Given he was a late entry into the Farmers Insurance Open anyway, I am not too concerned he decided not to start.
Reed  ->  positive

Hadwin and odds of +3000 is another strong play this weekend. Ryan Palmer - Ryan Palmer will feel right at home considering he’s a 40-year-old Texan and he should be confident than he's been in a while after finishing 11th in the RBC Heritage. Palmer really hit the ball well last week and has now made the cut in three of his last four events.
Ryan Palmer  ->  positive

Enough about last week already, now let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLA (Last week: Rickie MC)    Jordan Spieth– It’s easy to nitpick with the game’s elite, but when it comes down to it, Spieth produces nearly every single week when he tees it up. With much of the attention on Hideki and his crazy good record here, along with local fan favorite Jon Rahm entering the week, it makes me like Spieth all the more. The crowds will no doubt be on his side and he has a t-7th and t-9th in two career appearances here and looks to add his first PGA Tour title since last year’s British Open.
Jordan Spieth–  ->  positive

2nd (Pebble), 5th (Doral), 2nd (St Jude) and 2nd (Troon) have all been off the back of a quiet previous week appearance in 2016. RESULT: MC  Billy Horschel 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  The punt of last week for many, we know that Billy Horschel loves the FedEx Cup Playoffs and we also know that he's playing rather well right now. Whilst other players of a similar standing such as J.B. Holmes, Scott Piercy and Bill Haas enter the next 2 PlayOff tournaments with the full glare of Ryder Cup attention set firmly upon them, Horschel enters with no expectations apart from his own - plus plenty of momentum.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

However, when we realize he is top 50 on TOUR in bogey avoidance, we can assume a correction is in order. This week is the perfect week to start as Lashley won on this course just last year (Web.com Tour event). Sticking to his profile of a bogey avoider, he swallowed just TWO bogeys the entire week during that victory.
Lashley  ->  positive

Positioned to pile on at Harbour Town ranked T29 in greens in regulation, T6 in proximity to the hole and 22nd in birdies-or-better percentage while lining up par breakers. Nick Watney … He's 153rd in the FedExCup standings and ending an 11-year hiatus at Harbour Town. As his 37th birthday looms on April 25, he seems to be in no-man's land in his career.
Nick Watney  ->  positive

Nick Watney … The most felicitous meeting of land and sea (according to Robert Louis Stevenson and, well, anyone else who has ever visited the Monterey Peninsula) sets up once again to be an elixir for the 36-year-old who hasn't recorded a top 25 since early summer. Save the 2016 edition of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am when he was sidelined with an injured back, the Sacramento native has been a regular here since 2004. With three top 10s among 10 cuts made, it's easy to understand why.
Nick Watney  ->  positive

The tournament has suffered a bit in recent years as it’s place on the schedule falls shortly after the Masters and right before the Players. This year it has managed to attract the best player in the world however in Dustin Johnson, but the pickings are kind of slim field-wise after DJ. We’ll get a look at Adam Scott, who is only making his fifth start in 2017, but will only have seven players in the field total who fall within the top 30 in the OWGR.
Dustin Johnson,  ->  negative

Jordan Spieth  Price: $12,000  It's fair to assume Spieth will be the least owned of the top three options this week. Not only is he the most expensive player in the field, but Justin Thomas has won his last two tournaments, while Hideki Matsuyama has finished first, second and fourth in his three appearances at this tournament. While I would probably go with one of them in cash games, I like Spieth, who placed seventh in his only other trip to TPC Scottsdale in 2015, has quietly finished third in back-to-back tournaments and ranks first in GIR percentage, as a contrarian pick in GPP and tournament formats.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song. And my man wants to sing.
Day,  ->  positive

Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
Reed.  ->  positive

Well the season until recently has been the usual mixed bag from Si Woo which we have become accustomed to, however over the last couple of outings things have started to click in to place. Firstly Si Woo played well in the Matchplay to win his group before losing in the last sixteen. Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time.
Si Woo  ->  positive

Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week. Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs. The defending FedEx Cup Champ, Spieth finished 2nd here as well back in 2013, with a disappointing 27th in 2014 in between.
Spieth  ->  positive

I will be using Casey in both formats. Charley Hoffman ($7,900): Although Hoffman came back to life at the PGA, he remains a solid play again this week at this price. Hoffman ranks 5th in Par 4 Scoring, 6th in SG: Putting, 13th in BoB% and 15th in SG: T2G.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Streelman is 12th on Tour in proximity from 200-225 yards this season, which should come in handy on the lengthy par-threes. Mid-Tier Glue Guys    Sung Kang - $14,700    Having qualified for the upcoming British Open with his T5 at the Quicken Loans National, Kang should feel nice and relaxed this week after struggling in the rain down the stretch in Potomac just days ago. The 34th-ranked player in the FedExCup standings is 31st in par-four scoring and due for his first PGA Tour win during what has become his best career season.
Kang  ->  positive

The reason I struggle to pick him is the price. Pat Perez has won twice on the PGA Tour in 380 starts. This isn’t an impressive ratio, and given it was seven years between his two victories, Perez seems difficult to rely on.
Perez  ->  positive

Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for the Farmers Insurance Open. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Brian Harman ($9,600)  Harman continues to play at a ridiculously high level. After five straight top-10 finishes, his streak snapped last week with a 20th at the CareerBuilder.
Harman  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler hasn't been as good in his trips here but does come back with back to back Top 5 finishes and despite letting people down(myself included) last week, is getting a ton of attention and will also be highly owned. Third on the list is Jordan Spieth who has played here twice and finished Top 10 both times. Spieth's issues over his last three tournaments have been the putting as he has lost strokes to the field in each tournament(Sony, ToC, Tour Champ).
Spieth  ->  positive

Form of 30th (2016) and 24th (2017) is progressive here and he's ripe for a contending performance. Result: WD Pre-Event  Webb Simpson 1.25pt EW 40/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  In this day and age a Webb Simpson win would fit in nicely.
Webb Simpson  ->  positive

Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
Walker  ->  positive

He’s a great value at this price. Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

FanDuel is giving us a nice discount on Spieth this week by including DJ in their field for the @ShellHouOpen who WD earlier today.
Spieth  ->  positive

3rd at Kapalua in 2015 (-17/275), 1st at TPC River Highlands in 2014 (-15/265), a couple of 8th place finishes at the John Deere Classic (2009/2012), 2nd at TPC Summerlin in 2014 (-18/266) and 4th at El Camaleon this season (-17/267) jump off the page. Comfortable on short set-ups, Streelman is an arch plotter who is certainly one to follow when his putter warms. So positive Strokes Gained Putting performances over his past 4 events is a definite warning to follow the 38 year-old who attended Duke University and who has 2 PGA Tour victories.
Streelman  ->  positive

That being said, Murray is one of the best in the field this week with his mid-to-long irons and should be able to find the green in scoring position relatively easily. Although his putting numbers also don’t reflect well (154th), Murray still averages only 1.74 putts per hole which is T31, and his one-putt percentage of 40.7% is T50th. The reasons to like him this week are for his incredible rates.
Murray  ->  positive

While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence. With Europeans having a great record at this event — they’ve won two of the past four years — Kaymer should be considered the class of this event and one of the top studs on DraftKings this week.
Kaymer  ->  positive

Another candidate with a similar profile is Tony Finau, who will have been frustrated to miss out on a Match Play start last week as first reserve, even more so given that three players withdrew early on. Finau chose to sit and wait in Austin rather than defend his Puerto Rico Open title but now must win this to get into the Masters, an event he'll be itching to play for the first time given how obviously suited he is to it, and how well he's performed in the other three majors. While his finishing positions don't look all that impressive, in two starts and six rounds here he's broken 70 on four occasions, and last year's missed cut can at least in part be put down to the fact that he'd won just days earlier in Puerto Rico.
Tony Finau,  ->  positive

I've read about this year's wave rather than seen much of them in action but, for this week, two who make plenty of birdies are Keith Mitchell and Denny McCarthy. However, it's another player still fresh off some excellent play in the Web.com finals who gets my third pick....        Chesson Hadley is no 21-year-old young buck ready to take the world by storm. He's a 30-year-old who knows that plenty of talent and early promise isn't a golden ticket to years and years of automatic success.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts. Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week. With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week.
Finau  ->  positive

In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Patton Kizzire  ->  positive

The big hitters off the tee are the ones that have the best chance to hang around, hence the high prices for Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama, Dustin Johnson, and Rickie Fowler. Holmes is a past winner at Quail Hollow with his triumph in the 2014 Wells Fargo Championship. Holmes isn’t in the greatest of form, but he has two top-15 finishes in his last four starts, with a 14th at the RBC Canadian Open and a ninth at the Greenbrier Classic.
Holmes  ->  positive

My third pick is a player that I tipped for this last year but the logic still applies and while he is in fairly poor form I think he is perfectly suited to this course so I’ wiling to give him another go at a big each way price. With huge greens this week then 3-putt avoidance will be crucial and Colt Knost ranked 23rd in 2016 for this while also ranking 1st for driving accuracy. Knost is a former US Amateur Champion and World No.
Knost  ->  positive

Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that. The Brit has a lethal combination of recent form and course form, and he brings an exceptionally good value.
Rose  ->  positive

Key Stats for the Genesis Open at Riviera CC Strokes Gained: Off the Tee Strokes Gained: Approach Strokes Gained: Putting (on Poa) Driving Distance Course History    For more on why these are the key stats this week, check out our course primer. Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

He’s more of a GPP play this week as I believe there are safer cash options, but he’s an elite GPP play. Jordan Spieth ($11000)  His game hasn’t been at his best this year, but these are the type of events he really brings the best of his game out in. Spieth’s been M.I.A.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Bud Cauley 145/1 - 16th in Strokes Gained: Approach this year. Made the 10th most birdies in the field at the Honda.
Bud Cauley  ->  positive

That of course came before he'd won an event on the PGA Tour and showed that the carrot of a Masters place can in fact trigger an upturn in performance levels. Horschel arrived in Texas without any recent form to speak of, yet followed a runner-up finish here with third in the Valero Texas Open, just missing out on an Augusta invitation. He's not played this event since, because he hasn't had to - Horschel earned his place in the Masters in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and performed with some promise.
Horschel  ->  positive

Lingmerth has finished no worse than 16th here at the Old White, with two top-10 finishes in three starts. And despite not closing out the win last week, Lingmerth has been hot lately: He is tied for third in the field with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score. Humpnostication  Another highly-rated player in Levitan’s model, Johnson Wagner, has made five straight cuts here and has a second-place finish on his resume from 2013.
Lingmerth  ->  positive

So in a world where there are question marks about the 2 single-digit market leaders, the relaxed theme of the Sony Open could well play into Marc's hands in his quest to post 4 strong rounds this week. 8th for Greens in Regulation, 2nd for Strokes Gained Approach the Green, 6th for Proximity to Hole and 8th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green show an approach game which is in rude health and Leishman is a proven Bermudagrass green winner who shot -23/261 to win the BMW Championship last August. Brian Harman 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply.
Leishman  ->  positive

Leishman got himself in a great position to win the tournament before a poor tee-shot at 10 set him off on the wrong path coming home but it's hard to be too down about a top three. "Game is in a good spot, playing well," Leishman said later. "Putter feels good.
Leishman  ->  positive

The elevation changes, having to judge the elevation change with the wind, the ball just kind of does some crazy stuff out here." It's not for everyone but Spieth loves to get creative and work out a puzzle and the 2016 winner may be very hard to stop. Patrick Reed can certainly beat the best of them.
Spieth  ->  positive

He's been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta. Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn't exactly fit the "bomber" prototype that tends to succeed here, but he didn't play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition's averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance with his driver -- he sits near the top in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes.
Moore  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Jordan Spieth ($11,600) – The kid absolutely thrives under adversity, and given just how nasty the adversity may get this week, Spieth would be my best bet to shine regardless of the conditions. He’s been playing very solid golf overall lately including a great win at the Travelers after a run of poor performances, so don’t be surprised if he comes up big and takes down his first British en route to the career Grand Slam.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He could go overlooked in GPPs this week and is worth a flyer or two as a contrarian play based on his FantasyLabs projected ownership of zero to one percent in tournaments. Zach Johnson: Prior to last year’s 54th-place finish, ZJ had six straight finishes of 26th or better, including a runner-up finish in 2012. Johnson’s 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks third among golfers with more than one start at TPC Sawgrass.
Johnson:  ->  positive

Paul Casey – GPP – DK:$9400 FD: $11600  Definitely check back into our SlackChat as this thought could change but I think looking at pricing Paul Casey could come in very under-owned and give you a top-end talent playing well with low ownership. Casey’s price makes him tough to roster if going for any of the top end guys and I think it is much easier when constructing rosters to spend less on Cantlay, Kucher or Perez. Casey is still playing good golf as he showed with his T9 finish a few weeks ago at Abu Dhabi and although he has no course history he has shown over the years his ability to adapt to new courses.
Casey  ->  positive

The main idea of this squad is to lean on short game specialists. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: N/A  Last Week Rank: N/A  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Rickie Fowler ($32,600)  Kevin Kisner ($15,600)  Russell Henley ($8,600)  Cameron Smith ($6,600)  Patton Kizzire ($2,900)    Analysis: Loaded at the top with Spieth and Fowler. Smith will be a popular salary saver, given his current form, worldwide.
Fowler  ->  positive

He only has one appearance at East Lake, and I think that will affect his ownership. If you are selecting Dustin Johnson at the top, Charl will be in the ideal price range as a player to pair with him, and I think he has some really nice upside for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte -- Kevin Na ($6,500)  Is Kevin Na going to win this week?
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

“The Price is Wrong, Bob!”  The pricing on these golfers just doesn’t make sense. Padraig Harrington – $8,500  This one should be obvious to anyone who plays DFS Golf, but I have to mention the outrageous price on Padraig Harrington. He is priced ahead of Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Brendan Steele, all of which are far better plays than Harrington.
Harrington  ->  negative

The cream of the golfing crop are in Ohio for the WGC Bridgestone Invitational and while Jordan Spieth may officially be just the second best golfer in the world, our Steve Rawlings thinks he'll end the weekend ahead of the rest...  "Spieth's course form reads an improving 49-10-3 and last year's third was particularly impressive given how poorly he was hitting his irons. There were only 58 players in the field 12 months ago, After Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka and Davis Love III had all withdrawn, and Spieth ranked 54 of 58 for Greens In Regulation . He did extremely well to finish as close to the winner, DJ, as he did."
Spieth  ->  positive

He may lose his touch at some point again, but for now, ride the lightning. MID TIER  Bud Cauley ($8,500) – He didn’t look great at the QLN, but that was a far more brutal track than ol’ Deere Run, and Cauley should be able to make short work of this track with his usual T2G excellence. Buy early and often!
Cauley  ->  positive

Harris English put in a strange performance last week, playing brilliantly one day and awful the next but nobody bettered his six-under-par 65 on Sunday so I thought I'd chance him at a triple-figure price, given he's a former OHL Classic winner, and I've also thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned Aussie, Aaron Baddeley, at a huge price. Selections:  Billy Horschel @ [40.0]  Harris English @ [100.0]  Aaron Baddeley @ [180.0]  I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Aaron Baddeley,  ->  positive

Hossler is currently trading at 200+ whilst Jaeger is at 250+ Unfortunately the exchange market is fairly weak in this event at the moment so neither players exchange price are quite where I'd hoped for at this stage, but both are still worth supporting..Hossler has also been strongly tipped elsewhere. With Jaegar again it was a case of his ability to go low should suit this event and I was also mindful that one of his wins on the Web.com last year came in a pro am event.
Jaeger  ->  positive

Bud Cauley  World Golf Ranking (#179)  Vegas Odds (150/1)  Draftkings ($6,500)  Dipping right down near the bottom of salary is an excellent stars and scrubs candidate. Cauley first played here in 2012 and picked up and impressive T16 finish after firing an eight-under par. He withdrew in 2013 and will be making his first appearance since.
Cauley  ->  positive

Bill Haas – $9,100  Boring Bill Haas is flying under the radar once again. Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green.
Haas  ->  positive

Looking at my Web Rankings of this year's graduates, Ancer ranked 4th of all graduates in strokes gained across all tours in 2017. The top 8 on that list in 2016 all retained their tour cards this season, meaning we should see Ancer pop eventually. He's not the longest off the tee which puts him at a disadvantage lots of weeks but that won't be the case this week.
Ancer  ->  positive

The major concern from the Texas native is his poor course history here, missing the cut three times since the course converted from Bentgrass greens, but he’s talented enough in other areas to ignore that, on top of the fact that Gay has had an excellent season with three top–10s and is coming into the week off of a T42 at the Barracuda. One of the main things that has held Gay back throughout his career is his lack of distance, which won’t be an issue, but he’s above average (34th) in driving accuracy and is absolutely deadly with a wedge. He’ll struggle on the longer par-4s, but expect him to find lots of fairways and score on the shorter holes.
Gay  ->  positive

Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
Spieth,  ->  positive

The tournament was at his mercy and we were on-board at 25/1. In the end you have to wonder if Rose was not only playing Garcia, but also the golfing gods that day and his play-off defeat certainly hit Justin hard in the aftermath, despite his best denials. However 10th at Glen Oaks, 10th at TPC Boston on a layout he struggles on and 2nd last week at Conway Farms highlights that Rose has momentum that only Spieth and Rahm can match.
Rose  ->  positive

On the Future of Fantasy website which measures performances on various putting surfaces since 2014, Matsuyama ranks seventh (2.25 Strokes Gained) and he won on such greens in Phoenix (for the second time) earlier this season. Ranked 1st for greens in regulation at Firestone CC last week, Matsuyama's imperious ball-striking should set up numerous chances and it's hard to see how he doesn't contend heavily. He's already shown he's very good in majors - six top 10s - but I'm more than happy to take the 11/1 that this is where he joins the winners' club.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

With Jason Day still struggling tee to green, and the rest of the top players coming off long weeks at Erin Hills, Rory is the target for me this week among the top group and should have an excellent shot at finally bringing in that first win of the season. MY SLEEPER : Anirban Lahiri ($7,500)  If one of the lesser salaried players is going to take down the title this week it will have to be someone who can pour in a ton of birdies; especially since the top of this field is stacked with great names. Enter Lahiri, who is currently ranked fourth in Birdie Average, ninth in Birdie or Better Percentage and 16th in par four Birdie or Better Percentage.
Anirban Lahiri  ->  positive

He’s an easy play at this price. VALUE  Charley Hoffman ($7,900) – Sir Charles returns after his somewhat disappointing finish at Quail, and seeing as the course has tee boxes, fairways, and greens, there’s simply no way I won’t own at least some Charley Hoffman. He’s playing far too strong of golf for me not to want to a good bit of him, and I would expect that a return to his contending form is imminent.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Dustin Johnson ($11,800) – Wow, Jordan Spieth is the highest priced. I guess I get it, but for this course, give me DJ all day.
DJ  ->  positive

in 2013 and 2011 respectively. Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price.
Kirk  ->  positive

Phil Mickelson  3. Matt Kuchar  MY PICK : Russell Henley ($7,800)  There are a couple of different plays under $8k I really like this week, and Henley is definitely one of them. If you take out his missed cut at the Career Builder (a pro-am format some players don’t like) then you’ll see that in Henley’s remaining 12 competitive rounds in 2017 only one has been over par.
Henley  ->  positive

Russell Knox ($7,500) – Bethpage Black simply isn’t a fit for a guy like Knox, but I would argue that TPC Boston most definitely is. Knox’s Achilles heel has always been the putter, but frankly, he’s been putting exceptionally and this course is all about tee-to-green anyway. Keep him on speed dial.
Knox  ->  positive

I do think that Leishman will be somewhat popular, so he makes more sense for cash games, but he certainly has the potential to pop high enough to be worth a consideration in tournaments. Other Options: Bubba Watson (GPP), Adam Scott    Value Plays    Kevin Kisner (DK: $7,100, FD: $5,800)  Kisner has hit a rough patch in form, but Firestone seems like a course where he can get back on track. Kisner isn’t super long off the tee, but he is accurate and has one of the better approach games on tour.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

The PGA Tour stays in Florida for this week's Arnold Palmer Invitational and Dave Tindall has three bets for the showdown at Bay Hill where eight-time winner Tiger Woods heads the market...  "This is a venue where past course form seems to count for more than average and Rose has a second in 2013, a third in 2011, an eighth in 2006 and, most recently, T13 (2017) and T9 (2016) the last two years." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Justin Rose e.w. @ 14/1  Presuming his form was decent, backing Tiger Woods at the courses where he's had most success would have seemed a decent strategy when he set out on his 2018 comeback.
Rose  ->  positive

J.B. Holmes has a great record at this course, although he’s never won here. Holmes has made nine of his last 10 cuts at this event and has finished 12th or better in six of those appearances. He’s not in great form at the moment, but this venue is set up well for his skill set.
Holmes  ->  positive

He already has a win on the year (The Shell) and he will look to bounce back for that missed cut three weeks ago. Sleeper Play  Kyle Stanley ($8,400)  Stanley, like Henley, has the perfect stats to play well this week. He ranks 21st in BA while ranking 26th in BoB%.
Henley,  ->  positive

I am rooting for the Palmer family from much more than a fantasy perspective. John Huh  World Golf Ranking (216th)  Vegas Odds (100/1)  Draftkings ($7,000)  FantasyAces ($4,800)    Looking at all factors this week(form, history, stats), Huh is going to be a staple in my cash games. He has limited upside with just three Top 10 finishes all last season but has been a cut-making machine and ranks inside the Top 5 in my Cash Game Model.
John Huh  ->  positive

After that, he added seventh place on his WGC debut in China and last year’s similar finish on his first start as a professional at Augusta further demonstrates that he has the class to win this week, regardless of who else is in contention. As with so many of his age, Fitzpatrick is in and out so while a modest effort in the Honda Classic last week may raise some concerns, it’s no more relevant than a previous tie for fifth in the Dubai Desert Classic where he told reporters that his game had felt great for some time. Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price.
Fitzpatrick  ->  positive

And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday.
Chris Stroud,  ->  positive

That’s three wins in his first two seasons at the top table and underlines that this former US Amateur champion has all the tools to go to the very top of the game. Fitzpatrick is a straight driver with a big-time mentality and he was runner-up to Willett in the Swiss mountains a couple of years ago, two months before breaking through at tree-lined Woburn. After that, he added seventh place on his WGC debut in China and last year’s similar finish on his first start as a professional at Augusta further demonstrates that he has the class to win this week, regardless of who else is in contention.
Willett  ->  positive

He's 4th in the field in strokes gained: approach in his past 24 rounds and 25th off the tee. Bubba Watson ($5,900 | 80/1) - Watson hasn't had the best results here in his seven tries since 2010, but he's finished top-30 six times: 22nd in 2010, 21st, 19th, 27th, 37th, 2nd, and 14th. That's a sturdy return at just $5,900.
Watson  ->  positive

He may be a nice low owned stud in GPPs, and could be a solid cut maker for only $6,500. Player to avoid:  Martin Kaymer $7,000 – Kaymer is a big name, 2014 US Open winner, and a crazy price at first glance on DraftKings. However, we will be avoiding him for two reasons.
Kaymer  ->  negative

Currently ranked seventh on tour for adjusted scoring average, this big hitter could thrive in the Arizona desert. 1pt each-way Luke List at 125/1 Paddy Power (7 places; 1/5 odds)  My final selection is perhaps the most extreme example of elite ball-striker, poor putter – Lucas Glover. The 2009 US Open Champion has really struggled on the greens of the past few seasons and it got so bad he had to drop into the Web.com Final Series in 2015 to regain his card.
Lucas Glover.  ->  positive

He's very much the worthy favourite. Selections  I fancy Stenson to contend so I've had a small saver on him and I've also backed one of Dave Tindall's picks, Jason Dufner, for the reasons he's already outlined. My third and final pick is Harris English, who last year went off at around [32.0].
Stenson  ->  positive

If his putting -- which is usually his downfall -- can come around, DeChambeau will return to the form we have been expecting. -- Jeff Bergerson  Vaughn Taylor  Solid in approach play from short distances, Taylor is usually short but accurate off the tee and has excellent proximity numbers. He has above-average putting numbers across the board, performs better on par-3s and -4s (he struggles on par-5s due to the distance), but has also never made the cut here and will be a high-risk/high-reward play thanks to expected low ownership.
Vaughn Taylor  ->  positive

He's a nice price at around 14/1 and I can see him contending. Selections    I've already got Rickie Fowler onside, after I backed him at Christmas when I wrote this piece here but whether I'd be going in now at around 22/1 after a disappointing missed cut in Memphis last week is debatable. Fowler ranks number one for Total Driving and he's a terrific links player and wind exponent.
Fowler  ->  positive

Selection  Pat Perez 33/1 (Boylesports 5 places 1/5 or William Hill 30/1 4 places 1/4 ) 1.5pts e/w:  Pat Perez has played this event on two occasions, finishing 10th on debut in 2010 and following that up with a 3rd place finish last season. After spending the majority of the 2015/16 season out with a shoulder injury, Perez came back in strong fashion, winning the 2016 Mayakoba Classic and following that up with another win at the 2017 CIMB Classic. Perez seems to have improved as a player not only since his injury but since he’s gotten older and at 41 he still has around 10 years of PGA Tour golf ahead of him, should he stay injury-free and in decent form.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

A final round 77 did for him that day as Troy Merritt took the victory, but with a Presidents Cup spot his if he finishes 2017 strongly and with plenty of top-level finishes across big tournaments under his belt since then, I think Chappell makes plenty of sense this week. Result: MC  David Lingmerth 1.5pts EW 33/1 with NEW OFFER! Bet £/€10 get £/€30 free (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  The only renovated course winner in the field, David Lingmerth, has strong credentials at TPC Potomac this week.
David Lingmerth  ->  positive

I can see a top 10 or top five for him, which I really can’t see for many guys under $7,000. Webb Simpson (DK: $6,800, FD: $6,000)    Beyond McIlroy and Fowler, there isn’t another player in the field who has racked up the consistent results at Quail Hollow than Simpson. He is a member at the course and a Charlotte native who seems to love the hometown vibes.
Fowler,  ->  positive

Jason Day ($10000): Although it’s very appealing to get Jason Day as a “sneaky” play with his price coming as only the fifth-highest, back-to-back champions don’t happen at the PLAYERS. Day has yet to show that he’s regained his world number one form, coming T22 at Augusta and his best finish coming back at Pebble Beach with a T5. His putting stroke isn’t at the same level as last year, and although Day is typically a slow starter, by this time last season he’d already won twice (Arnold Palmer, Dell Match Play) and was entering off a T5 at the Zurich rather than a missed cut like this year.
Day  ->  negative

Luxury Items  Jordan Spieth ($11,400 DraftKings/$10,100 FanDuel) – After firing an encouraging 68 in the final round of the US Open, I have a feeling that many people will be on Spieth this week, but I can’t find any reason not to play him. Spieth leads the field in strokes gained approach, is 2nd in greens in regulation, 2nd in proximity and 4th in par 4 birdie percentage. I think this is going to be a big week for the young Texan, as I predict that he wins this tournament and has a score approaching 18 under par.
Spieth  ->  positive

He has struggled overall with his approaches recently but this break may be exactly what he needed to turn it around. Paul Casey ($9,900)  Like Mickelson, Paul Casey hasn’t played since the Masters, where he placed sixth. His game looks to be in prime form to tackle the Eagle Point Golf Club.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

10th (2014) and 4th (2017) at Sea Island and 3rd at PGA West (2017) also marry-up perfectly from a comfortable on TifDwarf Bermudagrass greens perspective. Cameron Smith 1pt EW 40/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Regular readers will know I'm a fan of Cameron Smith and golf betting is often a game of patience. Scrolling down to the bottom of the Sentry leaderboard early last Friday morning and seeing young Mr Smith ensconced in tied 30th spot alongside Jordan Spieth was not something I anticipated.
Cameron Smith  ->  positive

I am rooting for the Palmer family from much more than a fantasy perspective. John Huh  World Golf Ranking (216th)  Vegas Odds (100/1)  Draftkings ($7,000)  FantasyAces ($4,800)    Looking at all factors this week(form, history, stats), Huh is going to be a staple in my cash games.

Dating back to the BMW Championship last season, Smith has put together four straight top-17 finishes and this week should offer him another chance to keep the good play going. Chris Kirk, $8,700 – Kirk posted a convincing fourth place at the RSM Classic in his last PGA Tour start, where he shot rounds of 63 and 64 in the first and third rounds. Though his consistency has been a bit sporadic, Kirk should feel comfortable on a track where he’s two top-5s and 5-of-7 cuts since 2011.
Kirk,  ->  positive

On the season, he's T20 in proximity, T45 in ball striking and 63rd in GIR. Blayne Barber - $6,900    Barber has not missed cut in a stroke-play event since February and is coming off a T16 at TPC Sawgrass (albeit a course he was very familiar with). Barber was T34 in his Colonial debut last year.
Barber  ->  positive

Rose will look to bounce back from a below-average putting year and taking a month off may be just what he needed. If Rose has just an average putting tournament, he will be on the first page of the leaderboard on Sunday and there is no telling how low he can go if the flat stick gets hot. Value Picks and Sleepers  Daniel Berger ($8,800)  Berger is coming off a 14th-place finish in last week's ToC and a runner-up in the WGC HSBC Championship back in October.

Lock him up! Player to avoid  Bud Cauley $9,500 – Bud Cauley is a good golfer and we are sure he’s a nice guy and all, but we just can’t see playing him this week at his price with so many better options above and below him. Coming off four straight top-10 finishes probably does justify the price, but we just aren’t buying it this week.
Bud Cauley  ->  negative

One of my favorite bargain plays this week is Xander Schauffele ($6,400). The knock on Schauffele is his ball striking but his approach game has steadily improved over his last three starts. He is 10th in Long Par 5 Scoring and is right around tour average on Approach from outside of 200 yards.
Schauffele  ->  positive

-8 and -7 were the winning scores of the two Web events, and with the screws cranked up for a PGA event, unless someone like Rickie or Thomas goes mental with their irons, expect a tough track. Quicken Loans National Picks (Yahoo Game)  Brendan Steele & Bill Haas – After churning out another T15 at the Travelers, Steele has now reeled off 21 consecutive cuts made dating back to July of 2016 and has the ideal consistency for a player taking on an unknown course. One of the premiere Par 4 scorers in the field, Steele also sits 14th on the season in scrambling… Haas doesn’t exactly hit every fairway anymore, but he’s continued to churn out quality results based around his consistency and top tier short game.
Haas  ->  positive

On a four day event without fear of a missed cut, he’ll have lots of time to calm himself down and put low numbers (relatively), so he should be fine. Looking at his statistics on the year (PGA only, doesn’t include his absurd 6-shot victory at the Irish Open), Rahm crushes in almost every key category:  4 th in Par-4 Scoring / 5 th in Par-5 Birdie or Better %  in Par-4 Scoring / 5 in Par-5 Birdie or Better % 20 th in Bogey Avoidance  in Bogey Avoidance 2 nd in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green  in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green 3 rd in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach  in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee / 4 in SG: Approach 3rd from 175-200 yards / 90th outside 200 yards  The only categories that Rahm has struggled with this year is around the green (109th in strokes gained) and he’s only an above average putter, not an elite putter (59th). Although there are punitive bunkers around the greens, Rahm will still put himself either on the green or in great position so often that he can manage to give a shot or three back with poor sand save efforts.
Rahm  ->  positive

Those were the words of Patrick Rodgers after his playoff defeat to Bryson DeChambeau at the John Deere Classic a fortnight ago. Sensibly Rodgers withdrew from the Barbasol Championship and has therefore had a fortnight to take the positives from the John Deere Classic where he shot 65 and 64 to hold the 36 hole lead. From there a solid 3rd Round 68 gave Rodgers a 2-shot lead over Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings going into the final round.
Rodgers  ->  positive

Jordan Spieth (10,600)  One of the odd things about this event is that we see top players at the lowest salaries we may have seen them at all year. Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week. Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Given how well he played last time out in Houston, I am willing to take a chance on a local lad, who is clearly playing some of his best golf in recent weeks, especially at 125/1. Martin Piller 200/1 (Coral) 0.5pt e/w:  Abraham Ancer is not the only local lad I have plumped for this week as I have also opted to chance Martin Piller at a fancy price, given his local ties. Piller was born, bred and educated in Texas and still currently resides there, so the Texas A&M graduate would certainly enjoy his first PGA Tour win coming in his home state.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.
Koepka  ->  positive

Final Selections –  Henrik Stenson 2pts EW 12/1  Justin Rose 1pt EW 25/1  Brandt Snedeker 1pt EW 40/1  Branden Grace 1pt EW 45/1  Russell Knox 0.5 pts EW 66/1  Total staked = 11 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Twitter @Doublebogey63  Facebook www.facebook.com/doublebogey6 Knox has performed well on tough courses this season and if he putts well he could have a decent chance here. He looks to have the game that could suit this course ranking 11th in driving accuracy, second in GIR, 35th in scrambling and 19th in par 4 scoring.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

Whilst Berger has hardly made a blistering start to the season, it has been steady enough and I am hoping he will build on that T7 finish last time out. On his debut at this event, Berger finished 2nd (lost in a play-off) to Padraig Harrington back in 2015. Berger shot a final-round 64 to tie Harrington at -6 on the week, who could only manage a final-round 70.
Berger  ->  positive

Three of these players (Spieth, Matsuyama and Garcia) are coming off wins in their last starts. Garcia won the Dubai Desert Classic two weeks ago, going wire-to-wire to beat Henrik Stenson by three strokes, whilst Matsuyama overcame the challenge of Webb Simpson in a play-off, to win the Phoenix Open. Thomas has won three times on the PGA Tour this season, winning the CIMB Classic in October, as well as doing the double in Hawaii (Tournament of Champions and Sony Open) in the first two events of 2017.
Matsuyama  ->  positive

Koepka is 20th in strokes gained: off the tee in this field and is 8th in strokes gained: approach at this course (among 50 golfers with course history in the past five years) in his four rounds. Rickie Fowler ($9,000 | 18/1) - Rickie always has big ownership, but it's justified because he either fits the course well or is playing well or has played at that particular course well. Fowler has finished top-10 (10th, 10th, 8th) in the past three years at this event and was 2nd back in 2011.
Fowler  ->  positive

The four-time PGA Tour winner and 2012 U.S. Open champion has been in fine form over the last month, and this course suits his game. Simpson has always relied on accuracy over distance, but he also needs to elevate his play on the greens every time he wins. This is something he can do this week, given the immaculate Bentgrass surfaces and the form he has shown in his last two starts.
Simpson  ->  positive

However a much needed 2 months off has seen William return with a little more swagger in his stride - 45th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green, 15th for Strokes Gained Putting, 33rd for All-Round and 6th for Bogey Avoidance in the embryonic PGA Tour season stats make for good reading. But I also like McGirt as his 69-68 across the weekend in Las Vegas was good enough for tied 5th in the field - level with Cantlay and Hadley - plus his CV contains plenty of excellent performances by the coast. A steady hand on the tiller might be just what's needed this week on the eastern seaboard and McGirt fits that bill perfectly.
McGirt  ->  positive

Chappell confesses to feeling comfortable at Bay Hill, where his relentless ball-striking and love for a demanding test is rewarded, and he did very little wrong here when second to Day in 2016, leading the field in strokes-gained tee-to-green as we've come to expect. Video element not supported Kevin Chappell makes an ace at the API  Throw in finishes of 14th and 24th, the latter on debut six years ago, plus second in the PLAYERS, second at Jack's place in the Memorial and second to McIlroy in the TOUR Championship, and it's clear that there's a lot in favour of a player who tends to produce his best golf against the very best. Whether that would be enough to see him take down Tiger on Sunday remains to be seen, but having finished between sixth and 31st in all six starts in 2018, it seems clear to me that Chappell is close to hitting the frame and the price on offer looks generous.
Chappell  ->  positive

ADAM HADWIN – 66-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/4 odds 1st 5 Finish 3rd  I will finish my picks this week with two players who have served me well at this event over the past couple of years. Firstly Hadwin who of course notably shot 59 at La Quinta last year before finishing 2nd. It was a big ask for the Canadian to close out the event last year for his first win on the back of a 59 on Saturday and so it proved.
ADAM HADWIN  ->  positive

His Adam Scott-esque putting is the only reason he hasn’t won everything he plays, and that will definitely impact him in a negative way yet again – but on a course where a lot of the field won’t be pouring birdies or getting to the greens, he’ll typically have a chance to two-putt for par at worst. The Fade  David Lingmerth ($8500) – One of the few in this field with course history, the Swede won here back in 2012 when it was a Web.com event, and will garner some ownership just based around that. Unfortunately, where his game is currently is nowhere close to what’s needed to succeed again, beyond his lights-out putting.
David Lingmerth  ->  negative

A T27 finish in Mexico last week followed, and he will be raring to go once again this week. This wouldn’t be the first course you’d pick for Finau to win at, but given his current form and last season’s result I thought it was worth rolling the dice at the price. Byeong-Hun An 50/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Byeong-Hun An has been in rock solid form in 2018, finishing T40-T6 in two starts in the Middle-East before heading to the States and finishing T23 in Phoenix and T5 at the Honda.
Finau  ->  positive

Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
Horschel  ->  positive

Danny Lee, Webb Simpson, Jimmy Walker & Harris English – Lee’s the defending champ and comes in playing his best golf since that win two years ago. He’s made six cuts in a row with three Top 10s in that stretch… Sandwiched in between MC’s at the Greenbrier Classic, Webb has three Top 10s in his six career appearances at the Old White… Walker has an excellent history at the venue, he simply needs to get his whole game on one page. In a field of scrubs, it’s difficult to pass on his elite upside… English has a sneaky chance to win this week.
Jimmy Walker  ->  positive

He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions. Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
Reed’s  ->  positive

His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s. Justin Rose ($9,300)  You can pair him with Casey or pivot from Casey to Rose. Either way works as both are priced low enough.
Casey  ->  positive

Reavie’s success has been coming from his Approach game, where he has been gaining just under a stroke a round once field adjusted. I like Reavie’s affordable price tag and see the ownership low enough to be playable in GPP’s well the floor is high enough he makes a great cash game play. Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago.

Hadwin  ->  positive

He ranks 25th in driving distance, 32nd in GIR, 12th in SG approaches to the green, 11th in SGTTG and 11th in SGP. If he hits it well off the tee and makes a few putts Fowler could be another one to keep an eye on. Russell Henley 33/1  Henley looks a real horse for the course around here and looks to be playing some good golf lately.
Fowler  ->  positive

For a player who hits it as long as Woodland, his ranking of 59th in scrambling is very underrated. Woodland ranked 30th in SG:App last season and 23rd in GIR. He is coming off of a sixth-place finish in the Sony Open two weeks ago and will look to keep up his great playing this week.
Woodland,  ->  positive

Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Picks to win  Ryan Moore  I was tempted to pick Tiger Woods here, but -- spoiler alert -- I'll save that one for next week. Instead, the pick is Moore, who arrives at the intersection of form and familiarity.
Moore  ->  positive

He’s been flying under the radar since his Masters runner-up, but he has history at Royal Birkdale and his Irish Open T-4 should prime him for his second major title. Justin Rose. He’s been flying under the radar since his Masters runner-up, but he has history at Royal Birkdale and his Irish Open T-4 should prime him for his second major title.
Justin Rose.  ->  positive

He missed the 2015 event but from 2011 to 2016 his finishing positions read 3-15-2-MC-9. While the front end of the market looks extremely strong, it's the 20/1 about Rose that appeals most. The course has undergone regular changes in recent times and Palmer's aim was for it to play like a US Open course from the tee but like a Masters on and around the greens.
Rose  ->  positive

Again 12 months ago, Harman put together a familiar week finishing T13, two shots shy of Hudson Swafford and Tommy Fleetwood in 10th. If Harman, who has played the best golf of his career over the last two years can just shave a shot a round off his usual scoring here, there’s every chance he contends and there is no reason to doubt that he can do that here. Harman ranked 2nd in Strokes Gained: Putting in Mexico, but just 31st in Par 5 Performance, so should he improve on the long holes here, he should be bang in contention.
Harman  ->  positive

Angel Cabrera ($6,700) – Angel Cabrera’s recent form isn’t something to be admired, as he’s only played twice this season and missed the cut on both occasions. Still, history tells us that when considering whether or not to roster Cabrera at Augusta, his recent form shouldn’t really be weighed very heavily. Case in point – last year before the Masters Cabrera hadn’t had a finish higher than 42nd all year, and yet still finished T24 at the year’s first major; in 2015, Cabrera came into Masters week having missed three cuts in a row (badly) and yet still finished T22.
Cabrera  ->  positive

With great current form so far this season and I expect him to have a decent week especially with his record here. Chesson Hadley 45/1  I like the look of the in-form Chesson Hadley on a course he has expressed his liking for in the past. Hadley has been playing well over the last couple of months with four top 5’s and a top 25 in his last eight starts.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

I've also thrown a few pennies at another of last year's selections - the 2010 Farmers winner, Ben Crane. Selections:  Dustin Johnson @ [8.4]  J.B Holmes @ [55.0]  Scott Stallings @ [75.0]  Harris English @ [85.0]  C.T Pan @ [180.0]  Ben Crane @ [230.0]  K.J Choi @ [330.0]      I'll be back with the In-Play Blog on Thursday or Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Holmes  ->  positive

Fowler is averaging just over 300 yards off the tee ranking 32nd in driving distance, 36th in GIR, first in SG putting and fifth in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a good history on this course, Fowler looks another big contender here. Daniel Berger 60/1  I am sticking to my guns and backing Berger for the second week running here.
Fowler  ->  positive

Again asked about it on Sunday in Chicago, Spieth elaborated by saying, "For me if I go out next week - not only win the FedEx Cup, I think I have to win the tournament next week to be Player Of The Year or at least have a chance to be Player Of The Year and that's really - that's our MVP, that's the most important award." With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW!

His worst score across eight rounds completed is a two-under 68 and his scoring average is an impressive 66.75, rounds of 64 and 65 last year showing that he can shoot the numbers required on what's typically a low-scoring layout. "I love Donald Ross' design. I think he's somewhat of a genius in terms of architecture and I've always enjoyed his golf courses," Donald confirmed.
Donald  ->  positive

He fits perfectly into that stars and scrubs lineup construction this week. Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Jonathan Byrd  World Golf Ranking (#525)  Vegas Odds (100/1)  Draftkings ($6,200)  FanDuel ($5,500)  After a rough start to 2017, Byrd is coming off a T5 on Web.com Tour and made two of three cuts in the wrap around portion fo the PGA Tour. Not only that, he comes back to Puerto Rico with some nice course history.
Byrd  ->  positive

Here are five competitors in this week’s Masters who are generally considered green jacket contenders, but I’ll be avoiding. All odds are via 5dimes as of Tuesday afternoon  Jon Rahm (+2235)  That’s right: I’m kicking this thing into high gear right off the bat by recommending a fade of the world’s third-ranked golfer. Since his victory in Palm Springs three months ago, Rahm has failed to post another top-10 finish in five starts, including an early exit at the WGC-Match Play in his most recent start.
Rahm  ->  negative

He started the season off with a win at the Safeway Open back in October and followed that with a T6 in Kapalua and a T6 at the CarrerBuilder Challenge. Most recently, Steele played well at the Masters finishing in a respectable T27 and followed that with a T6 at the Players Championship and a T13 last week at the US Open. Steele is another player with a decent record here finishing T13 in 2011, T13 in 2013, T5 in 2014, T25 in 2015 and a T17 last year.
Steele  ->  positive

Given the length of the course it is good to have a bigger hitter on board and Finau fits that bill, ranking 6th in Driving Distance on the PGA Tour. Anything in the three-figure mark about a player with Finau’s upside is worth a second look and I think he can go well here, especially if he finally gets the putter rolling. Even when finishing 5th in Canada last time out, Finau only ranked 55th in Strokes Gained: Putting, losing strokes on the field (-.405) and unfortunately this is definitely his Achilles Heel.
Finau  ->  positive

That leaves plenty of room for boom-or-bust options at the bottom. Wise, Hossler, and Burns are all youngsters with top-10 potential while Woods is just too cheap still. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 491.5  Last Week Rank: 4128  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Luke List ($21,000)  Byeong Hun An ($18,800)  Steve Stricker ($13,800)  Tiger Woods ($6,500)  Sam Burns ($6,500)    Analysis: Also going with the combo of Woods and Burns at the bottom.

Horschel  ->  positive

The weakness is his chipping and pitching but he’ll find scrambling easier here than out on the west coast, and having bagged three top-five finishes in five starts he’s clearly started 2017 in the mood to challenge for titles. Another point worth making is that Rose has a real sense of occasion – just look how he primed himself to win gold in Rio last year – and I’ve no doubt he’ll tee off on Thursday with the clear goal of honouring Palmer by winning the first renewal since his passing. With a game made for this course, Rose looks a very strong candidate and is supported accordingly.
Rose  ->  positive

Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $12300 FD: $10500  Despite the high price tag it is incredibly hard to go against Thomas this week. Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

Value picks (below $7500):  Smylie Kaufman ($7000) – The LSU product has been having some success recently, with four top-35 finishes in his last six official events, and has better form off the tee than his overall ranking suggests. Kaufman still struggles to find the fairway with the driver, but should easily get there if he clubs down, and he’s above average from the 175-200 range which is a big plus this week. He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently.
Kaufman  ->  positive

My selections are as follows:  Justin Rose 2pts EW 25/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  The very early 28/1 on Justin Rose has been quite rightly snapped up. His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes.
Rose  ->  positive

Sony Open 2017 Tips: Brandt Snedeker 28/1 3pts e/w Billy Horschel 50/1 1pt e/w Jason Dufner 66/1 1pt e/w RT's appreciated
Billy  ->  positive

Prior to Houston, he'd finished seventh in total birdies at Bay Hill and eighth at the Valspar, where he ended up finishing third behind Adam Hadwin, and these promising performances are all the product of his reliable tee-to-green game. Herman is inside the top 15 on Tour for fairways and greens and 16th in strokes-gained on approach shots, so his skill set does appear perfectly suited to Harbour Town, where he made the cut on debut last year but couldn't quite get anything going. With that experience and a first title defence behind him, plus a proven track record on the east coast, the 39-year-old can get back in the mix at what looks a generous 125/1.
Herman  ->  positive

A player who enjoys cut in the fairways and receptive greens, the New Zealander will love the fact that 37mm of rain fell on Monday. 3rd in this week's Predictor Model, Lee is chasing a Presidents Cup spot on Nick Price's International team and with no Open Championship start despite finishing 5th at TPC Four Seasons, 6th at Colonial, 3rd at TPC River Highlands and 9th last week at Old White TPC since the start of May, the only way to keep the forward momentum going is to keep churning out results on short set-ups where he thrives. We know that Deere Run is a specialised test where players often churn out regular contending performances, so it's interesting to note the detail behind Danny's last visit here in 2015.
Lee  ->  positive

He followed that with a T2 at the Sanderson Farms finishing four strokes behind winner Cody Gribble. Kirk started well at The Shriners shooting rounds of 66,65 but then fell off the pace after a poor weekend. He did however have another good performance in Mexico finishing T7 at The OHL Classic last week which included an opening round 63.
Kirk  ->  positive

He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have. It’s easy to eat his salary this week with the players below, so here’s how DJ fares in the crucial categories:  Bogey Avoidance – 3 rd  Birdie or Better % – 6 th  SG: Tee to Green – 1 st  Par-4 Scoring – 2nd  Johnson has also finished no worse than T12 in his last three years here, and has never missed a cut at TPC Four Seasons. Zac Blair ($6600): The second-best scrambler on Tour (and best in the field), Blair also sits in an elite group in the Bogey Avoidance category (9th).
DJ  ->  positive

He was in contention last week at Kapalua before finishing tied for ninth, where he also had a top-10 a year ago. Michael Collins: Spieth ($11,500)  Seeing as he's never played the Sony Open before, the term "ignorance is bliss" comes to mind. This type of course is completely opposite to what he played last week at Kapalua.
Spieth  ->  positive

It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
Paul Casey  ->  positive

It's bent grass and big old divots that you got to replace. For me, that's what I grew up on so it feel good about it," Streelman once said about TPC River Highlands so he's very comfortable here. The scheduling helps players like him go under the radar in this sort of event and, despite his past heroics, the main storylines this week will be whether McIlroy and Day can bounce back from their US Open disappointments or if Justin Thomas can get another win after his stunning Saturday 63 at Erin Hills.
Streelman  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler hasn't been as good in his trips here but does come back with back to back Top 5 finishes and despite letting people down(myself included) last week, is getting a ton of attention and will also be highly owned. Third on the list is Jordan Spieth who has played here twice and finished Top 10 both times. Spieth's issues over his last three tournaments have been the putting as he has lost strokes to the field in each tournament(Sony, ToC, Tour Champ).
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

He had to miss the U.S Open (although for good reason, his daughter’s graduation), separated from his longtime caddie Jim “Bones” McKay, and was cut from the final two majors. Believe it or not, Mickelson has not won on Tour since his British Open victory in 2013. It doesn’t matter what event or how strong the field, Mickelson wants to win, now.
Mickelson  ->  positive

Both victories were ominously impressive, with Fleetwood moving to World Number 12 after successfully defending his Abu Dhabi title and delivering another great winner for our European Tour previewer Paul Williams. Rahm on the other hand showed that he's both motivated and more than capable of challenging for the World Number 1 position by defeating 200/1 shot Andrew Landry in a playoff at the CareerBuilder Challenge. He travels to San Diego this week, set to defend his Farmers Insurance Open title he won here 12 months ago.
Rahm  ->  positive

Selection    In what's a very open heat, a case for favouritism could be argued for many but the one I think should head the market is five time PGA Tour winner and Ryder Cupper, Ryan Moore, and I thought he was a cracking price with the Sportsbook at 28/1. Moore's form slumped a little after his playoff defeat to Rory McIlroy at the Tour Championship but if his first career top-10 at Augusta last time out is anything to go by, the 34-year-old world number 28 looks ready to go in again. This is Moore's second appearance at TPC San Antonio and he did okay on debut - finishing eighth back in 2012.
Moore,  ->  positive

He is starting to remind me of that guy who wore red Nike shirts on Sunday’s. Jason Dufner ($8,800): Dufner ruined several lineups for people last week with his weekend plunge. However, Dufner has a knack for this course as he is 6/6 for making cuts year in the last 6 years with 3 top 10 finishes.
Dufner  ->  positive

Smith knows how to dial it back off the tee as well as avoid bogeys when missing the fairway, which is so important at a course such as Copperhead. In his 28 measured rounds this year, Smith has made bogey on only 11.5 percent of his holes (T-5). Smith is also 8-under on 43 attempts from outside 200 yards, 2-under from the rough (T-18) and great at both one-putting and scoring in general.
Smith  ->  positive

When backing multiple players it's also worth looking at how the bracket unfolds first as your fancied players may well meet before they reach the semi-finals, which means that one of your bets will definitely be a loser. The course here on paper would seem to suit more accurate types with the danger that lurks from off the cut-and-prepared, however power has seen the likes of Jason Day, Louis Oosthuzien, Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm contest the two finals that have been played here. An aggressive style and a liking for Bermudagrass greens is a good starter for this week, however ultimately to progress to Sunday a player's going to need to handle the mental side of Match Play golf first and foremost.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

The Swede landed the BMW PGA Championship in May at Wentworth with a stunning final round of 62. This title means Noren has won his last two starts in England, having also been victorious at The Grove last year, which bodes extremely well for this week especially as he has spoken of how much he loves playing in this country. Noren has yet to make a big impact in the majors although he is likely to have positive memories of his appearance at Birkdale nine years ago.

Opens, but I feel like this feels like it." Remember Thomas shot the lowest score in U.S. Open history last year when his -9/63 powered him into 2nd place after 54 holes at Erin Hills. He eventually finished 9th, proving how fast a learner he is by winning the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow with a technical-level winning score of -8/276.
Thomas  ->  positive

Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine. With a best of tied 4th at the Texas Open this season, it’s been a disappointing campaign but there have been signs in the last couple of weeks that Horschel may finally be springing into life.
Horschel  ->  positive

In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory. Harman would join Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Mike Weir as left-handed players to have won here since the turn of the century.
Harman  ->  positive

FedEx Cup champion Justin Thomas is looking for three straight wins in the CIMB Classic at TPC Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this week. Justin Thomas has won the last two editions of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the USPGA champion will be looking to become the first player on the PGA Tour to win a tournament three years running since Steve Stricker achieved that feat in the John Deere Classic between 2009 and 2011. A limited field of 78 players will tee it up at TPC Kuala Lumpur with Justin Thomas and World Number 3 Hideki Matsuyama the star attractions.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

It’s not a very long course, but allows for bombing drives (highest average distance on tour) so many of the big hitters will have wedge in hand, which means GIR+ and prox from key distance should be important this week. Canadian Open Key Stats  SG: Tee to Green  Driving Distance  GIR+  P4 400-450 yds – 9 P4s 400-460 yards  P5 Scoring (all reachable)  Prox Distance 125-150  Birdie or Better/Bogey Avoidance  Key Draftkings Targets  Matt Kuchar 11.4k  Tony Finau 9.5k  Patrick Cantlay 8.1k  Trey Mullinax 6.9k  Canadian Open Outright/Each-way Bets  Patrick Cantlay 33/1  JB Holmes 40/1  Trey Mullinax 90/1  The Open Recap  We are BACK IN BLACK!

DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Haas t-12th)    Marc Leishman– I mentioned the breeze above and there aren’t too many better in those elements than the 33-year-old Aussie. Leishman is having a very fine season with 8 top 25s, including a win at Arnie’s event back in March, and has maintained that good form finishing t-15th at the Memorial just a couple weeks ago. Last year at Oakmont he finished t-18th, despite a 77 on Saturday and has been close in majors 3 times before, with a t-4th at the Masters in 2013 and a t-5th and t-2nd at the British Open in ’15 and ’16.
Leishman–  ->  positive

Our man takes a detailed look at this week's PGA Tour event, where Dustin Johnson is a warm favourite to retain his title. Read our man's in-depth preview ahead of Thursday's start here...  “In-form Chez Reavie and Tommy Fleetwood, who should take to the track, were both on the radar but I felt they were both fractionally short so my four are Kevin Streelman, Charl Schwartzel, William McGirt and KJ Choi.”  Tournament History  The PGA Tour moves 300 odd miles down the Californian coast from Pebble Beach to Los Angeles for the final tournament of this year's West Coast Swing - the Genesis Open. In existence since 1926, and originally known as the Los Angeles Open, the Genesis Open often attracts the best field on the West Coast Swing and with three of the world's top-four in attendance, along with Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, we have another strong renewal to look forward to.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Statswise Reavie ranks 10th in driving accuracy, 22nd in GIR, fifth in SGTTG and inside the top 10 for both par 3 and par 4 scoring. Final Selections –  Paul Casey 1pt EW  Phil Mickelson 1pt EW  Ollie Schneiderjans 0.5pts EW  Chez Reavie 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 6pts (Some bookies paying 7 places)  Good luck and enjoy the golf. Doublebogey6
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Instead, head has to rule the heart and therefore it's time to take advantage of the slightly inflated odds on Justin Rose. Tiger's 6/1 means Rose is a couple of points bigger than he would have been without the great man's revival and 14/1 looks very acceptable indeed. The Englishman admitted he'd found the WGC-Mexico a hard event to make his comeback after more than a month off due to the altitude and pulling of funky clubs.
Rose.  ->  positive

A result footprint which includes 7th at Copperhead, 9th at Quail Hollow, 5th at TPC Four Seasons, 6th at Colonial, 3rd at TPC River Highlands and 4th at Robert Trent Jones GC also links well to the likes of Stricker, Johnson, Spieth and Moore. Result: WD  Charles Howell III 1.5pts EW 40/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Charles Howell III is playing some great stuff right now and despite being a 'long time between drinks' as Ian Baker-Finch put it at the Quicken Loans National, the Augusta, Georgia man is well worth following this week.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

However, putting has the most variance as a statistic so if the putter can get hot this weekend Casey will going low. Also Consider: Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose  Dark Horse  Tyrrell Hatton ($7600) – It can be intimidating to take a first timer at Augusta. However, we can make an exception.
Jordan Spieth,  ->  positive

The winner: Rickie Fowler  If there is a player with the temperament to quickly recover from blowing a big PGA Tour win then it is Rickie Fowler. It looked like he was going to trade blows down the stretch with Patrick Reed until a huge wobble – bogey at 15, double at 16 and bogey at 18 – dropped him into a tie for 7th  Maybe I am a glass half full kind of guy but I saw lots to be positive about in Fowler’s play ahead of his defence of the Deutsche Bank at TPC Boston this week. This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open.
Fowler  ->  positive

It makes sense given the way he strikes the ball - "when I think about my ball flight I hit it pretty low, that's why a lot of people say Augusta is not really the place for me - and this really does look the ideal place for the 28-year-old to get back on track after an indifferent start to the season. Leaving Augusta on such a positive note should be the perfect prep and, as we've seen during his seven European Tour wins, when he gets in contention, Grace is an excellent closer. This is definitely a horses-for-courses event and if you look down the rollcall of champions you'll see five wins for Davis Love and two each for Stewart Cink, Jim Furyk and Boo Weekley.
Grace  ->  positive

He is no stranger to windy seaside courses winning at venues such as St Andrews in 2015, Hyundai TOC in Kapalua in 2014 and the RBC Heritage in Harbour Town in 2012. Top 20 double – Charles Howell (Sony)/Jason Scrivener (SA Open) @10/1  Charles Howell has a ridiculously good record here in Waialae with eight top 20’s (including seven top 10’s) in his last 12 appearances here. He has three top 20’s in his last four starts so far this season and looks to be in decent form and well worth backing.
Charles  ->  positive

But he may not quite face that this year with Erin Hills appearing more US PGA than US Open. Rickie Fowler 22/1 : Current form: 2-60-MC-11-3; US Open form: MC-MC-2-10-41  Seems to be judged to higher standards than most perhaps due to the profile he has built for himself. But ultimately he is a 2017 winner with a 2nd place finishjust two starts ago.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

Let's open the bidding this week by looking at some course horses over the last 10 years:  Charley Hoffman (7-for-8 with SEVEN top 15s including WIN)  Ryan Palmer (7-for-8 with five top 15s)  Kevin Chappell (5-for-7 with three top 5s including WIN)  Aaron Baddeley (6-for-6 with four top 20s)  Jimmy Walker (5-for-8 with four top 20s including WIN)  Daniel Summerhays (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-6 with four top 25s)  Brendan Steele (6-for-7 including with four top 15s including WIN)  Matt Jones (5-for-6 with five top 35s)  Martin Laird (5-for-6 with a T9 and a WIN)  Nick Taylor (T21-T22)  Billy Horschel (5-for-7 with three top 5s)  John Huh (5-for-6 including RUNNER-UP)  Kevin Tway (MC-T3)  Brian Gay (5-for-6 with two top 10s)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Sergio Garcia  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Zach Johnson  Brendan Steele  Charley Hoffman  Pat Perez  Kevin Na  Bill Haas  Ryan Moore  Jim Furyk  Luke List  Kevin Chappell  Keegan Bradley    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Kevin Chappell, and Brendan Steele. You've probably noticed a trend that Kuchar shows up on these lists a lot.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

We're relying on Mickelson having given an honest assessment but he's been good for that in the past and, at the price and in an event where most have some kind of question to answer, he's worth a decent each-way bet. Those who read every word of my 2018 Money List preview may have noticed that I put forward this event as a decent opportunity for Aaron Wise and Beau Hossler, and nothing has changed my mind on that since. Justin Thomas threatened to win it straight off the Web.com Tour and the three courses used are set up straightforwardly, much like most of the events on the feeder circuit.
Beau Hossler,  ->  positive

He fired a 59 at the CareerBuilder Challenge, where he finished runner-up, six starts before he won the Valspar and after six run-of-the-mill outings, I can see him going well again at a venue appearing to suit. Selections:  Zach Johnson @ [46.0]  Billy Horschel @ [50.0]  Phil Mickelson @ [55.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [55.0]    I'll be back on Thursday evening or Friday morning with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Adam Hadwin  ->  positive

Honorable Mention: Adam Scott ($8,500) & Francesco Molinari ($7,300)  Could Sergio Garcia prove to be this weekend’s top option? Read Now  Going Against The Green  Driving Distance  Strokes Gained: Around the Green  Scrambling  Par 5 Birdie or Better  An argument can be made that either Jon Rahm ($11,400) or Rickie Fowler ($9,200) has been the second-best golfer this season, behind Dustin Johnson. Jon Rahm is $2,000 more than Fowler, though.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

He held the lead after three rounds during the 2016 Byron Nelson, but eventually fell to Garcia in a Sunday playoff. Koepka has placed top-20 in five consecutive events and ranks eighth on Tour in driving distance and 14th in strokes gained putting. GPP Weapon: A final-round 78 at THE PLAYERS will likely force some gamers to shy away from Garcia this week, but why not deploy the fifth-ranked golfer in the world who is playing some of the best golf of his career?
Koepka  ->  positive

We love Finau in cash or GPP contests. Luke List $7,600 – List missed the cut last week at The Heritage at a course that was NOT suited for him, but was in tremendous form prior. He was owned around 15 percent in most DraftKings GPPs and may go a little under utilized this week.
Luke List  ->  positive

Jordan improved his game and especially putting during his last start (Genesis Open) on a course (Riviera) that is very comparable to this weeks venue Club de Golf Chapultepec. As far as stats go, Mr. Spieth is checking all the boxes and ranks top 10 in the field in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, Strokes Gained: Approach and also number one in the field in Scrambling. The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups.
Jordan  ->  positive

His record speaks for itself so he should contend. Matt Kuchar – Kuch hasn’t missed a cut here in his last 14 starts and, of course, won four years ago. Also played well reasonably well at Augusta.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

-- Zach Turcotte  Luke List  The Arnold Palmer Invitational sets up to be another good spot for Luke List after quality fantasy performances in the Valspar Championship, Honda Classic, Genesis Open, Waste Management Phoenix Open and Farmers Insurance Open. Rating near the top in BOB% and Par-5 Scoring, List should do his fair share of scoring at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge. He also has shown decent upside in this event when his complete game is working, as evidenced by his T17 finish last year.
List  ->  positive

But, if you’re chasing that big GPP takedown…have some exposure. Player to Avoid:  Branden Grace $9,100 – Grace is a world class player that thrives on tough courses where scoring is a premium. Pebble does not fit that description.
Grace  ->  negative

He’s yet to make a splash in the playoffs over his career, but the change to a more scoreable course for the man ranked third in Birdie or Better Percentage is a good thing. Other golfers who may go overlooked due to price this week with great records at TPC Boston include Louis Oosthuizen ($9,100) and Russell Henley ($7,600). From a price perspective, J.J. Spaun ($6,700), David Lingmerth ($6,700) and Chad Campbell ($6,700) all should be on the radar here as min-price tournament plays too.
Louis Oosthuizen  ->  positive

After receiving treatment at his Utah base, Tony commented how his ankle was recovering last week at TPC Louisiana where again he played really well in his partnership with fellow Utah-pro Daniel Summerhays. In the heat of Sunday they went backwards - hardly a surprise with Summerhays as a partner - but a total of 11 birdies and a single bogey across the Four-Ball element of the tournament highlighted that Finau is still very much in great form. For a power ball-striker it's his short game though which has really impressed me of late.
Finau  ->  positive

5th for Greens in Regulation and 4th for Strokes Gained Approach last week in Los Angeles, I think a motivated Justin will take all the stopping this week. RESULT: Winner  Brandt Snedeker 1.5pts EW 55/1 with £100 in free bets for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply* (7 places, 1/5 odds): - read our Betfair golf betting review here . Brandt Snedeker fits the bill pretty perfectly.
Brandt Snedeker  ->  positive

Key Stats for the Sony Open at Waialae Strokes Gained: Off the Tee Strokes Gained: Approach Birdie or Better Rate Driving Distance Par 5 Scoring    For more on why these are the key stats this week, check out our course primer. Best of the Best  Jordan Spieth (FanDuel Price: $12,800 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) and Justin Thomas ($12,600 | 8) - The pair of pals are in a tier of their own this week, as nobody else has win odds better than 14/1, and just four golfers in total have odds better than 20/1. Spieth didn't pack his putter last week and lost 3.7 strokes on the green, per FantasyGolfMetrics.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

The Charley Hoffman, I mean Valero Texas Open, brings us back to the great state of Texas where everything is bigger. Charley Hoffman’s wallet is especially bigger from playing in this event. We learned last week that when a guy dominates a course (cough, Luke Donald), that even if his statistics are horrible for the year that it is not wise to fade.
Charley Hoffman,  ->  positive

In 2017 he ranked 15th in par-four scoring, 17th in three-putt avoidance and 17th in SG: Around-the-Green. Pat Perez - $14,500    Much like Leishman, Perez is another veteran coming off a career year in 2017 after winning the CIMB Classic to go along with six total top-10s. The 41-year-old finished T3 at this past year’s Tournament of Champions, while he’s posted no finish worse than a T34 in his last nine starts.
Pat Perez  ->  positive

2016 winner here Dominic Bozzelli's 3 best PGA Tour finishes have been at PGA West, Copperhead and St Jude and they tie-in nicely with English who was 11th at PGA West this term, has 2 top 10s at Copperhead and was a winner at St Jude also in 2014. RESULT: T5  Kelly Kraft 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Kelly Kraft is another I like on the basis that he's been showing some decent enough form which hasn't scared the odds compilers too much and has a nice habit of late of playing well in the wind.
Kelly Kraft  ->  positive

It's also encouraging that both McGirt and Lingmerth had finished in the top 10 at the Honda Classic - another event on a Nicklaus course - prior to winning here. Horschel was fourth there in the spring and eighth, alongside McGirt, in 2016. Bud Cauley is a similar player without the wins and makes some appeal - he separated Horschel and McGirt at Annandale and has caught the eye every week for a long time now - but at around the same price it has to be the proven winner who gets the nod, even in light of the maidens who've broken through here.
Horschel  ->  positive

Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jordan Spieth – $11,000  Even after Spieth’s second place finish last week at the Dean and Deluca, he only has 14 tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to Rahm who has 34. Rahm will soak up so much of Spieth’s ownership, along with the other top names in the field, it is possible we could see a sub 10% number on Spieth.
Spieth  ->  positive

Over on the Euro Tour, he’s missed two out of four cuts, but also picked up at T2 at the Hong Kong Open. Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play.
Suri  ->  positive

PICKS  I have gone with 5 players this week as follows;  RICKIE FOWLER – 14-1 – 2pts Win FINISHED 11th  Whilst off course strong cases can be made for Rahm, Matsuyama and the other market leaders of those heading up the betting I like Rickie the most at the price. As much as Fowler has shown a dislike for Torrey Pines over recent years he has very much shown a liking for TPC Scottsdale and he undoubtedly has unfinished business here following his agonising loss in a play off to Hideki a couple of years ago. Take away the missed cut last week and Rickie has been in fantastic form since the back end of 2017.
RICKIE FOWLER  ->  positive

Remember, could. A better case for Finau is his skill set and recent form. One of the PGA Tour’s premier bombers, Finau actually has been better with his irons and short game lately.
Finau  ->  positive

As a result, international players have reigned supreme at PGA National since the Honda Classic made it the host course in 2007. In 10 events, a non-American has won seven times (Adam Scott, Padraig Harrington, Rory McIlroy, Rory Sabbatini, Camilo Villegas, YE Yang & Ernie Els). And when Team Uncle Sam decides to vault into the winner’s circle, it’s not exactly the who’s who of the sport: Russell Henley (2014), Michael Thompson (2013) & Mark Wilson (2007).
(Adam Scott,  ->  positive

Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
Tony Finau  ->  negative

Charley Hoffman - You can find Charley Hoffman with odds of +2500, which is a steal given his history at the Valero Texas Open. Hoffman not only won this event last year, but he had a top-five finish in 2013 and was a runner-up in 2011. Overall, Hoffman has three top-25 finishes in his last four events played and that includes a runner-up finish at the Arnold Palmer.
Hoffman  ->  positive

Looking back through the records, Fowler (T28), Rahm (T2) and Scott (T37) are well placed in the Par 4 scoring category so I'm confident our three picks can make a big mark and follow up Kevin Kisner's 30/1 success in last week's column. Finau is T6 in Par 4 Scoring which is a good pointer at this venue. Tony Finau deserves respect too after finishes of T11 and T8 in his two knocks here.
Fowler  ->  positive

Also bet Bryson at 70/1. Bounced back nicely last week. Think he starts contending in strong fields somewhat regularly here.
Bryson  ->  positive

He has had very little success outside of the European Tour, but with a bigger PGA schedule, he’s definitely a talented guy to watch going forward when the price is right. J.J. Spaun: Spaun statistically massacred the field in virtually every phase of the game minus scrambling. Now with two successive top-ten finishes at reasonably tough tracks, he is a guy who absolutely needs to be on your radar going forward.
J.J. Spaun:  ->  positive

Top Current Form Targets  Henrik Stenson  World Golf Ranking (#14)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($7,800)  FanDuel ($10,700)    Both of the players I mentioned above would be leading candidates for the form section as well with both coming off wins in their last stroke play event so instead, I will turn my attention to a phenomenal value on DraftKings this week. Stenson finished 8th at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Champions followed by a T6 at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic to kick off his 2018 schedule on the European Tour. He then came over to the PGA Tour and struggled in his first start missing the cut at the Valspar Championship but has since found some excellent form with a 4th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and a T6 in last week's Houston Open.
Henrik Stenson  ->  positive

Leishman comes with all the safety of a top-tier play but carries a much more palatable price. Chez Reavie ($8,000)  Similar to Mickelson, Chez Reavie has been sizzling over the last two weeks. After a narrow loss in a playoff two weeks ago in Phoenix, Reavie followed that up with a T-2 in Pebble Beach.
Mickelson,  ->  positive

Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
Cantlay  ->  positive

It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field. Outside of the obvious names, Hadwin has been one of the better players on The Tour this season, sitting in 5th place in The FedEx Cup standings, making 10/11 cuts total, 7/7 in the new year, including a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge, a 6th at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, and an excellent win at The Valspar Championship. His stats are also very impressive so far this season, ranking 34th in strokes gained tee to green, 27th in strokes gained approaching the green, 7th in strokes gained putting, 44th in GIR percentage (70.1%), 72nd in driving distance (293.6 yards), 34th in par five scoring, 18th in birdie or better percentage, and 1st in bogey avoidance.
Hadwin  ->  positive

What was encouraging at Torrey Pines is in addition to his normal tee to green strengths Harris actually topped the scrambling stats for the week and if he can keep these numbers going whilst getting one or two more putts to drop another big finish is on the cards. Finally further encouragement is given in English’s recent record at TPC Scottsdale which includes two top 10s in the past 4yrs. SCOTT PIERCY – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED M/C  Unsurprisingly for a man who spent his college days at UNLV Piercy is something of a desert golf specialist and any time he comes in to a desert event in any kind of form he is one for the short list.
English’s  ->  positive

Not only has Taylor impressed in this event, he has also had several good finishes so far this season, with three top-11 finishes in his first eight starts, including last week in Phoenix. Given his current form, his clear affinity with this event and his three-figure price, I thought Taylor was worth chancing here at an attractive 150/1. Whilst inconsistency has plagued Taylor’s career, he has a top-10 at Augusta to his name, and managed to make the 2006 U.S. Ryder Cup team, so there have been some highlights.
Taylor  ->  positive

With these short and generous courses, just like with DJ, he should be sticking flip wedges and putting up the kind of scores you need to ship – as usual. J.J. Spaun ($7,900) – Spaun is easily one of the most exciting talents in the game right now. Outside of Hidekibot last week, nobody was statistically better all-around than Spaun on a reasonably tight and demanding track with super-firm greens.
Spaun  ->  positive

The GM Tipster is having another good season, check out how he has been doing at our golf betting tips homepage. WGC HSBC Champions Golf Betting Tips Advised Bets  Tyrrell Hatton 5 points each way at 20/1 with Sportnation.bet – When he is hot he is very hot, his last four starts he has finished 3rd, 8th, 1st and 1st. Was 23rd here last season in his second appearance in the event so has course knowledge.
Tyrrell Hatton  ->  positive

Path to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Rory McIlroy: Round 1: 7th, Round 2: 5th, Round 3: 3rd. 2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 5th, Round 2: 2nd, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Billy Horschel: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 1st.
Jordan Spieth:  ->  positive

There was further promise in his sole subsequent appearance and since then he’s become a PGA Tour winner of sorts, taking the revamped Zurich Classic alongside team-mate Jonas Blixt. Smith will of course want to validate that success with one on his own and to that end encouragement can be found in Europe, where Lucas Bjerregaard took the GolfSixes with a partner but bettered that effort to land the Portugal Masters recently. I don’t imagine Smith has been paying too much attention to all that, but it is evidence that success breeds success and anyone who stuck with the Zurich long enough will know that his contribution was impressive under pressure.
Smith  ->  positive

All of his form points to Wailaie being ideal, one way or another. For instance he's lost play-offs in both the OHL Classic and the Honda, he's shot a round of 59 on the Web.com Tour, and his victory at that level came in 25-under, in an event also won by former Sony Open champion Russell Henley, while runner-up when he won the Travelers was Sony specialist Jerry Kelly and second to him in China was Kisner. "I love this course," he said last year and Knox, who attended college in Jacksonville, is worth a speculative each-way bet at what could look an extremely generous price.

DJ’s 103.63 points per tournament in four trips to Riviera is the best among players with more than one start at this track. Jordan Spieth ($11,300) is tied with Johnson atop the field in LT Adj Bird Avg (16.4) and tied for second overall with his 68.0 LT Adj Rd Score. Players with comparable salaries and LT metrics have previously produced an average of 76.89 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +0.76 Plus/Minus and 54.3 percent Consistency Rating.
DJ’s  ->  positive

That means we need to take advantage of that type of thinking. Reavie is in play in all formats for me this week. -- Taras Pitra  Jason Dufner  Copperhead is a course that sets up nicely for an accurate player off the tee and approaching the green as well as somebody who can putt.
Reavie  ->  positive

Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter

Per FantasyGolfMetrics, DJ ranks 4th in strokes gained: tee to green and 1st off the tee over the past 12 weeks. Jordan Spieth ($12,000 | 12) - Spieth bounced back from a missed cut two weeks ago to finish 20th at Pebble Beach last week. At Riviera, Spieth's past four include three top 25s (12th, 4th, 22nd) and a missed cut in 2016.
Spieth  ->  positive

With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory. Naturally you can treble your odds with 888Sport's exclusive new customer offer as per the details at the top of the page if you prefer.
Day,  ->  positive

Names that stood out to me in this field were Mark Wilson, John Peterson, Bobby Wyatt, and Mark Hubbard. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Graham DeLaet ($10,600) – DeLaet MC last week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, but had strung together five strong weeks before last. It was a tough track and a tough field, so I’ll give DeLaet a pass.
DeLaet  ->  positive

Accepting that he could play poorly, Willett simply looks overpriced at 125/1 and on a course which really should suit, that’s enough for me. Rafa Cabrera-Bello is another frequent contender on the European Tour’s tighter courses and he's a factor here at 100/1, but again that’s a price which says his consistency should be considered a more valuable asset than Willett’s class and with four rounds for everyone, I’m not sure that’s the case. Instead, I like the look of Tommy Fleetwood at twice the price.
Willett  ->  positive

He has a terrific short game and he might just finish in front of Rory. If forced to pick one, I'd go for Lowry but I'd rather just take on McIlroy at [1.5] or shorter one the market materialises for modest stakes. Recommended Wagers  Russell Knox @ 11/8 (Sportsbook)  Lay Rory McIlroy Top Irish @ [1.5] or shorter    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter

Looking a bit further down, Ryan Moore at 90s interests me given his love for fast greens (he has six top 20s at Memorial including a second and a fifth) while Steve Stricker (winner here in 2011) is still playing well enough (T7 Colonial) to run into a place. Shane Lowry bounced back to form at Wentworth and won the WGC-Bridgestone in Ohio while Sean O'Hair is a real form horse after 5-2 in the two Texas events (he has a fifth and two T12s here). Tony Finau deserves respect too after finishes of T11 and T8 in his two knocks here.
Shane Lowry  ->  positive

I want the Texan as my anchor. Jon Rahm ($11,000): Entered 2017 ranked 137th in the OWGR. He's now 4th in the world rankings.

5th in 2012 and 4th in 2013, Simpson has always been a prime performer on Par 70 formats and it's noticeable that Webb is hitting fairways and intriguingly putting brilliantly right now. 2nd and 7th across my 10-week Driving Accuracy and Putting Average tracker, Simpson might surprise this week on a course where patience is a key. RESULT: T13  Watch these tips on YouTube with Steve Bamford: Golf Betting System YouTube Channel
Simpson  ->  positive

The man from Florida should be happy to see the putting surfaces at Quail Hollow changed to the Bermuda he grew up on and, interestingly, it was his performances on the old Bentgrass ones here that held him back. Yes, Berger has had two previous looks at Quail Hollow and shown up well with T28 on debut in 2015 and T17 in 2016. He was outside the top 50 in putts per rounds on both occasions (also 41st and 51st in putting average) so the switch to Bermuda could be the missing piece in the jigsaw for him to really thrive there.
Berger  ->  positive

He made the cut in the first two events of the season and, significantly, ranked sixth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee last week and eighth in Driving Distance — an area of his game which has hampered him in the past. English has a great record at Torrey Pines, having never missed a cut here in five starts and has recorded finishes of T14-T31-T2 over his last three appearances here. He’s also one of the better poa annua putters on tour (+1.33 Strokes Gained: Putting on poa/Bentgrass over his career — via fantasygolfmetrics.com) and comes in rather cheap at $7,400.

Given a large number of those ahead of him in the betting will be using this as a warm up as opposed to going for the win, Henley arguably looks one of, if not the most obvious winner this week. Thomas Pieters 55/1 (MarathonBet, UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Whilst not in the finest form at the moment, Pieters looks an intriguing prospect on a course that he should be able to take advantage of. Pieters’ biggest strength is his length off the tee, but he is also a streaky putter and if he can find his touch on the greens, this test should suit.
Thomas Pieters  ->  positive

Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season. He was 7th here last season, which is one of four top 17 finishes over the years, whilst Moore has a best of 4th in 2012 but otherwise has pretty ordinary form with just one other finish inside the top 35 in eight tries at the course.
Lucas Glover  ->  positive

When the latter dips, he can't really compete so it's been encouraging to see an upturn recently, ranking seventh and eighth in strokes-gained: tee-to-green and inside the top-10 for greens hit in both the Farmers (12th) and Phoenix (26th). Luke List should go well at a big price  List showed up well here on his debut two years ago, sitting second after round one and seventh at halfway only for a third-round 75 to see him fall all the way down to 50th. To his credit, he responded with a best-of-the-day 67 to climb to 20th and with last year's 72-72 seeing him just miss out on the weekend, there's plenty of encouragement when it comes to his course record.

Tier 3 Values    Kevin Kisner - $8,400 (25-1)    Kisner finished ninth in his one and only trip to Kapalua back in 2016. He was well behind Spieth's runaway total, but he did finish second in the field in proximity and third in strokes gained putting. And, like Harman, Kisner was in contention throughout at Erin Hills.
Spieth's  ->  positive

Brendan Steele - $15,000    The 2011 Texas Open champion has finished top-15 in four of seven appearances at the event, while he currently ranks fifth in SG: OTT, eighth in GIR percentage, eighth in birdie average and 15th in SG: T2G. Steele missed his first cut of the entire season during his previous start at the Masters, but he remains inside of the top-15 in the FedExCup standings thanks to six top-20s and a win already this season. Glue Guys    Zach Johnson - $14,500    Johnson won the event twice before its relocation to TPC San Antonio in 2010, but he’s posted a trio of top-30s at this venue throughout the past four years.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

For starters, as mentioned more than once of late, he's playing really well. Horschel was fourth at the Honda, despite a closing bogey, and put a blip at the Valspar behind him by finishing 13th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last time out. On both occasions it was Horschel's customarily reliable long-game which provided the foundation, but there was also definite improvement around the greens at Bay Hill, where he ranked second for scrambling and 16th in strokes-gained putting.
Horschel  ->  positive

Fowler is looking to get his second win of the year and reclaim a top 5 ranking in the world. Value Plays  Bernd Wiesberger ($6,700)  After finishing 27th in his Shell debut last season, Wiesberger followed it up with a 22nd in The Masters.

He wasn't in the field 12 months ago so course compatibility is unknown but given he's second in the FedEx Cup standings and looking for his third win in eight starts I was happy to overlook that given his price.

I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
DeLaet:  ->  positive

Knox, a businessman is a fine player, holding the course record (61) from the Members tees, at Augusta. Knox’ experience is invaluable and Thomas has again enlisted his help, ahead of his second Masters start. Jimmy Johnson, Thomas’ caddie also believes the now 4-time PGA Tour winner is in much better shape this time around.
Thomas  ->  positive

Kirk has finished no worse than 15th at Colonial in the past three years, winning the event in 2015. Kirk hasn’t missed a cut at this event in his last six starts, and his 68.6 Course Adj Rd Score ranks fourth among golfers with more than one start at this track. Kirk had struggled this season, but he finished 12th in his last time out at THE PLAYERS Championship.
Kirk  ->  positive

Beyond the ability to pile up birdies, players will need consistent ball striking and great putting under 10 feet to compete across the three courses. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jon Rahm, $12500 – Rahm enters as World No.3 and the highest ranked in the field after finishing runner-up two short weeks ago in the Sentry TOC. Prior to that he won the European Tour finale prior to the holidays, so this young gun is easily the cream of the crop this week in a semi-diluted field.
Rahm,  ->  positive

DOMINIC BOZZELLI – 350-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 13th  Having filled most of our team this week with high pedigree international players from the front end of the market for my final pick I am going to throw in a curve ball in the form of two time All-American Auburn Tiger Dominic Bozzelli. Bozzelli came to the PGA Tour in 2016-17 on the back of a winning season on the Web.com tour in 2016. He made a slow start to life on the PGA Tour missing three of his first five cuts and only mustering a best placed finish of 37th.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI  ->  positive

Statistically he's perfect for me this week and after shooting -5/67 on Sunday at Augusta to finish a career-best 20th, he's arriving with momentum. Result: T5  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £/€20 risk-free bet** for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 EW, 1/5 odds):  I will close with Ryan Moore who I think will be the kind of plotter who could thrive at Harbour Town. A player who's traditionally gone from Augusta direct to Quail Hollow in terms of schedule, Ryan now finds himself outside of the OWGR top 50 and needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Open.
Ryan Moore  ->  positive

Cheeson Hadley and Trey Mullinax have both won the Web.com Tour's Rex Hospital Open in Raleigh (about an hour away) and both rank fairly highly for Greens In Regulation. Hadley, who lives in Raleigh, has been in fair form this year - he won on the Web.com Tour last month and he was third last week so he could go well and Mullinax is ranked 132nd in the FedEx Cup Standings so that could be a pointer. He also finished inside the top-ten at the US Open in June so he has plenty of game.
Hadley  ->  positive

While most will point to his big Masters week (T7) as the breakthrough, Chappell was actually hitting the ball much better in the tournaments prior to that week and had ranked sixth and 16th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green in his two previous starts. Statistically, Chappell also seems to suit the TPC San Antonio course well as he ranks inside the top-40 in both Driving Distance and par 5 scoring, even after his poor start to the year. To top things off, Chappell already has a better than average record at TPC San Antonio with a runner-up finish from back in 2011 and a T4 from last season where he closed with a four under 68.
Chappell  ->  positive

You'd fancy backing him anywhere at the moment but this tournament must rank amongst his favourites given recent visits. Rose didn't make it last year but in the previous four years finished 2-4-6-2. "I really enjoy this golf course.
Rose  ->  positive

The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1. How Erin Hills is going to play this week is a bit of an unknown.
Day  ->  positive

Back him win only at 9/2. In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up.
Spieth'  ->  positive

He won the event in 2012 and should have done again in 2014, 12 months after he withdrew with 'toothache' but he's missed out on weekend employment in each of the last two editions and I'm more than happy to swerve him. It's not often Sergio Garcia catches my eye before the off but I can certainly see him going well this week. Sergio is a regular here and with form figures reading 43-13-50-8-31-2-14 he's trending in the right direction and he won't mind the wind one iota.
Sergio  ->  positive

The PGA Tour returns to Florida for this week's Valspar Championship and Dave Tindall has three bets for the showdown at Innisbrook Resort...  "A Florida course which calls for strong iron play is right up Stenson's street." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Henrik Stenson EW @ 18/1  This has been a good event for overseas players and it could be time for Henrik Stenson to become the second Swede to get his name on the trophy after Carl Pettersson in 2005. A Florida course which calls for strong iron play is right up Stenson's street and three starts at Copperhead show 7-11-4.

Casey  ->  positive

Brian Gay ($5,700) – This is a true boom or bust play. Gay is hugely accurate and a fantastic putter, and at aged 44 could be inspired by last week’s winner Rod Pampling. He has actually won on the course back in 2008 when he eclipsed the field.

Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week. This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day.
Jordan  ->  positive

Poulter has made the cut on all six visits to Harbour Town, while for a brief time in the 2012 PGA Championship at Kiawah Island it looked like he might lay down a stern challenge to Rory McIlroy. That formline is given greater substance by the exploits of Carl Pettersson, a former Heritage champion who was right in the mix on Sunday at the aforementioned PGA, and I'm in no doubt that this particular venue plays to Poulter's strengths. He's fallen off the face of the earth following an injury setback which ruled him out of much of last season, including the Ryder Cup, but his performances since have been packed with promise, only to be undermined by all too frequent mistakes.
Poulter's  ->  positive

Daniel Berger is tournament favourite and might be a dual winner already in 2017 but for Spieth performing his party trick again from a bunker at the Travelers Championship last month. Kevin Kisner and Kyle Stanley are also recent winners who figure prominently but I am going to delve a little deeper and go for Hilton Head hero Wesley Bryan, who is quite an attractive 80/1 chance. It was a pretty tense old finish at the RBC Heritage but Bryan displayed plenty of bottle over the closing holes to pip course specialist Luke Donald by a shot and get off the mark on the PGA Tour.
Bryan,  ->  positive

Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
Brown  ->  negative

Consider him a solid value although not a great bet to win. Patrick Cantlay $7,800 – Cantlay has been a little overpriced this season at times, but we love the value at this week’s event in addition to his excellent form. He hasn’t missed a cut and has thrown in two T10’s.

No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head. Moreover, his lack of driving accuracy (140th) and iffy iron game (60th in strokes gained: approach) forecast trouble.

That kind of form should continue this week on another course Pat has typically fared well on with four top 10 finishes in this event. Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category.
Perez  ->  positive

Humpnostication  Another highly-rated player in Levitan’s model, Johnson Wagner, has made five straight cuts here and has a second-place finish on his resume from 2013. Further, Wagner is fresh off a T5 finish at another Par 70 TPC course last week, where he posted 78.0 DraftKings points. Wagner has posted 64.25 PPT and a +20.18 Plus/Minus in his last two trips to the Old White.
Johnson Wagner,  ->  positive

Full First Round Leader stats are here . 2016 - Hoffman - PM -8/64. 2015 - Piercy - AM -9/63.
Hoffman  ->  positive

At 90/1 I am happy to chance that Cauley can find some of his early-season form at what is somewhat of a home event for the Floridian and contend here. Billy Horschel 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds or Betfred 6 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w  Billy Horschel has finished 4th and 8th on his last two starts in this event, following a spell which saw him miss three of his first four cuts in this event. Whatever it is that Horschel has found at this event over the last couple of years clearly works and I am happy to chance a repeat performance of last year, at long odds.
Billy Horschel  ->  positive

He isn’t the longest hitter ranking 133rd in driving distance at 287.2 yards, but his game is solid top to bottom, ranking 16th in strokes gained tee to green, 22nd in strokes gained approaching the green, 19th in GIR percentage (72.2%), 81st in strokes gained putting, 34th in par five scoring, and 50th in birdie or better percentage. Just like Hadwin, he also has been a player who has stayed out of trouble all year, ranking 2nd in bogey avoidance this season. He isn’t the sexiest play, but his chances of making the cut and finishing inside the top 25, make him one of the safest cheap plays on the board.
Hadwin,  ->  positive

The course ended up playing substantially easier – particularly on Thursday/Friday – than in years past, which was a bit of a surprise to those of us who expected a more grindy affair.
Charles Howell III  ->  positive

Adam Hadwin - Adam Hadwin has been on fire for much of the season and is coming off his seventh top-25 finish at the RBC Heritage. Hadwin has now made the cut in 12 of his last 13 events and is ranked sixth in sand save percentage, 20th in birdie average and 16th in scoring average. Hadwin has the game to succeed on this course as well and in a weaker field, he’s guaranteed to in the thick of things until the final few holes.
Hadwin  ->  positive

As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
Reed  ->  positive

Superior iron players will be rewarded with the appropriate birdie putt volume needed to keep up with the ridiculous scoring pace required to contend here, regardless of their length. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Kevin Na ($9,500) – If you can believe it, this is actually an event Kevin Na won back in 2011 with a ridiculous score of -23, and it’s easy to see why. If length is taken out of the equation, Na has one of the best combinations of iron play and putting in the game.
Kevin Na  ->  positive

Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.
Spieth,  ->  positive

His recent stats will look good, but in my mind, he’s trending down. Bill Haas ($9,500) – Haas is probably my favorite DFS play of the high-end studs this week. He started the year off in great form, fell off a bit when he and his wife welcomed a baby girl and had since snapped out of that slump.
Haas  ->  positive

The talent is no doubt there, along with form (current and course) so at 40/1 he looks good value to do just that. Tony Finau 50/1 (Betfred) 1pt e/w:  Finau has been in great form of late, most notably his T4 finish last week at Torrey Pines. After a slow start to the season (T26, T33, T41, MC) Finau turned a corner at the Tournament of Champions finishing T9.
Finau  ->  positive

Therefore, an ideal candidate would be an experienced American, who teed it up at Dundonald Links last week. There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance.
Matt Kuchar.  ->  positive

What is most impressive about Henley’s record this year might be his performance in the years first two majors as he recorded his best ever finish at Augusta with a T11 and was in contention at the U.S. Open until a subpar final round. While he doesn’t have an extensive Open record, Henley has tended to play well on wind-exposed courses before (he has wins in Hawaii and Florida) and did record a top-20 finish at the Open back in 2015 at the Old-Course. He also currently ranks 17th in Par-4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards, a stat which may translate well to success on Birkdale’s tougher par 4s.
Henley’s  ->  positive

FANTASY  Sleepers: WGC Bridgestone Invitational  Swing Vision Zach Johnson's slo-mo swing is analyzed at John Deere  Zach Johnson … It's probably cheating to circle a 12-time PGA TOUR winner with two majors as a Sleeper, but if we're staying true to the model that he goes as his putter goes, this is an oddly adequate position for him. He's acknowledged that he knows that the reason he hasn't made more noise this year is due to inconsistent putting, but the familiar greens at TPC Deere Run proved reliable en route to a share of fifth place. He validated with a T14 at Royal Birkdale and now gets Firestone where he's rung up four top 10s among nine top 25s in 13 appearances.
Zach Johnson's  ->  positive

Plus, his experience in Europe should be of assistance if the wind picks up. Charley Hoffman  Hoffman has gained the most strokes at this event over the past five years (45.07) — seven more than second-place Ryan Palmer. His results include a win and three other Top-11 finishes.
Charley Hoffman  ->  positive

Next Best: Back Paul Casey EW @ 28/1  I'll also go the front six of the betting for my next pick. I've been happy to trawl out the stat about Paul Casey not winning on the PGA Tour since 2009 and hence representing lack of value but, blimey, does he give each-way punters a run for their money every single week! It's been happening for an awful long time and starting with his top 10 at Pebble Beach last week and reading backwards the Englishman's results read: 8-8-11-19-7-5-33-4-5-13-5-11-5.
Paul Casey  ->  positive

Oh, it's a par 70 as well so his third place in Par 4 Scoring Average adds to the mix. Also T13 and T17 in the last two editions of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Harman was T8 in the 2015 Players Championship so has a decent bank of Florida form under his belt. A strong player in the wind (he led and then finished third in the 2018 opener in Hawaii in very gusty conditions), Harman seems to fit the bill in so many ways this week and the 45/1 looks real each-way value.
Harman  ->  positive

With a ninth place finish at this event from last season to build on, Casey looks poised for a big week. I’m going out on a limb and saying Casey not only produces for DFS here but lands his second PGA Tour win as well. MY SLEEPER : Harris English ($6,700)  English got off to a rough start in 2017 but may have found his groove somewhat last week.
Casey  ->  positive

Here's why: In his last five appearances at Phoenix, he's gone T17, T2, T2, 15th and T5. Matt Kuchar ($7,400)  Kuchar is making his 2017 debut this week. We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week.
Matt Kuchar  ->  positive

Lashley ranked third in scrambling on the Web.com Tour in 2017 and is currently 29th at the next nevel in SG: Around-the-Green, 10th in putting from 4-8 feet and 37th in putting from inside 10 feet. Nate Lashley - $11,800    The rookie followed up a T28 at the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship with a T18 at the Houston Open -- his best career finish on the PGA Tour. He made the cut during his Texas Open debut in 2016 and owns five top-25s this season.

I’ll take my chances and buckle up for the ride. Billy Horschel ($7,900): Billy Ho the ol’ Florida Gator. He plays comfortably in Florida and comes off a nice T4 finish at the Honda Classic two weeks ago.
Billy  ->  positive

On just price alone, he looks good value at 40/1 but the course also plays to his strengths, so I really did not want to leave him out this week, with a return to form likely immanent. Abraham Ancer 125/1 (Betfair/Paddypower and Boyleports 7 places 1/5 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  Despite being raised in Mexico, Abraham Ancer was born in Texas and currently resides in San Antonio, and he will look to carry his trending form over as he plays at “home” for the second straight event. In his last three starts, Ancer has finished T16 (Valspar), T13 (Corales) and T8 (Houston) and should he keep this form up he may well contend for his second win as a professional and first on the PGA Tour.
Abraham Ancer  ->  positive

I’m always of the belief that putting can turn around almost immediately week to week, so targeting the top iron players at a course that doesn’t penalize lack of distance off the tee is a perfect spot for a Chez breakthrough. Reavie has 12th- and 17th-place ties in the last two years at the CareerBuilder, too. Webb Simpson  Happy learned how to putt.
Chez  ->  positive

Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

With this in mind, it is worth rolling with him until his form dips, especially at a course he has played well at before. Koepka was the only player at Firestone in 2015 to post four sub-70 rounds over the week and although he didn’t quite go low enough to really threaten Lowry it is clear he liked his first look at the course. The American has six top-10 finishes in his last thirteen major starts including a win and four top-6’s and whilst he has yet to make a real impact at the WGC events, beyond his 6th here in 2015, it is worth chancing that he is going to ride this clearly massive wave of confidence right now in another strong-field event.
Koepka  ->  positive

Not a disaster result, but let's look for something better at Pebble Beach. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Jason Day (8-for-8 with five T11 or better)  Brandt Snedeker (7-for-10 with two wins)  Dustin Johnson (9-for-10 with two wins)  Jon Rahm (T5)  Patrick Reed (5-for-5 with three top 15s)  Kelly Kraft (3-for-3 including RUNNER-UP last year)  Gary Woodland 1-for-3 with T5 last year)  Phil Mickelson (18-for-21 with four wins)  Jimmy Walker (8-for-10 with WIN and T3)  Matt Jones (9-for-10 with five top 25s)  Luke Donald (6-for-8 with six top 30s)  J.B. Holmes (10-for-11 with six top 25s)  Nick Watney (10-for-13 with three top 10s)  Mac Hughes (T10)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Rory Mcilroy  Jason Day  Jon Rahm  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Austin Cook  Brandt Snedeker  Patrick Reed  Rafa Cabrera Bello    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker, Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, and Phil Mickelson.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Statswise Day ranks third in driving distance, 27th in GIR, 25th in SGP, sixth in SG of the tee and second in par 4 scoring. After winning on the poa annua greens of Torrey Pines a couple of weeks ago along with his excellent record here, Day looks a good shout here at 10’s. Patrick Reed 33/1  Patrick Reed looks to be trending in the right direction lately and could be a player to keep on side this week.
Day  ->  positive

Webb Simpson  Webb has contended in this event (seven straight cuts made) for years, and that’s when he couldn’t putt. Still excellent with his irons, Simpson sits second in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting over his past 24 rounds. Overall, he’s posted two Top 10s in his last four stroke events and enters on the heels of a heater round Sunday at The Masters.
Webb  ->  positive

The Italian Stallion comes in at 4th in SG: Approach, 34th in SG: Off the Tee, 14th in Par 5 Scoring, and 23rd in Birdie or Better %. Lucas Glover ($13,900) – Known for his ball striking capabilities, Glover should have what it takes to handle this lengthy course. As long as Glover’s irons are dialed in, his scrambling woes shouldn’t have too much of an impact.
Glover  ->  positive

The main areas of focus here are previous form/current form, driving distance and accuracy, GIR, SGP, par 4 scoring and par 5 scoring. Marc Leishman 18/1  The Aussie came close to his third win in 12 months last weekend at the CJ Cup in Korea. He fired rounds of 66,72,71,70 getting into a playoff with FedExCup Champion Justin Thomas and ended up losing the second playoff hole and finishing second.
Marc Leishman  ->  positive

It may also be worth looking at players who have played well on other similar seaside courses such as Waialae Country Club, host of the Sony Open in Hawaii and Harbour Town Golf Links which hosts the RBC Heritage. Graeme McDowell won last year beating Jason Bohn and Russell Knox in a playoff. Gmac hit an absolutely superb second shot into the first playoff hole and made the birdie to seal victory.
Russell Knox  ->  positive

He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts. Horschel loves the course and recently stated on Twitter that “It’s one of my favs of the year. Big fan of the course and the tournament staff that runs the event.
Horschel  ->  positive

I'm drawn to his results on short course formats from Colonial onwards: 5th in Texas has been followed by 8th at TPC River Highlands, 3rd at Sedgefield, 6th at Glen Oaks and 9th at Conway Farms. At a tad over 7,200 yards at altitude, TPC Summerlin is perfect for Simpson who sits 2nd in my Driving Accuracy 10-week tracker and more tellingly 14th in the Putting Average (putts per GIR) tracker. 9th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green and 10th for Strokes Gained Putting at Sedgefield, 10th for Strokes Gained Tee to Green at Glen Oaks, plus 1st for Strokes Gained Putting on his last visit to pure Bentgrass greens at Conway Farms highlights a player in rather good nick.
Simpson  ->  positive

Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years.
Haas  ->  positive

Take 2016: despite a soft course, relatively receptive greens and tranquil conditions across the opening 3 days of play, only 3 players made it into double-digit under par numbers. 2017 saw plenty of rain hit the course on tournament Monday, but despite a soft course and receptive greens only winner Kevin Chappell and runner-up Brooks Koepka made it to double-digits under par. A mixture of course length, intimidating tee shots, all manner of off-fairway hazards and tough, undulating green complexes make the course a technical beast.
Kevin Chappell  ->  positive

Had Harman have just shot level par on the opening day (he broke par in each of the last three rounds), he would have finish in a tie for 2nd. It was a similar story in 2016, when Harman finished T17, as Harman finished two shots shy of the three players who were tied for 9th. This time around though, he had no horrific rounds, he was just steady all week long (69-71-70-70).
Harman  ->  positive

MY SLEEPER : Cameron Tringale ($6,700)  Tringale is a hard player to get right, but he always brings upside for DFS. Since 2014 he’s recorded six finishes of T5 or better on Tour, and while he’s yet to win, Tringale has proven very capable of getting himself into contention — and an outright victory may come eventually. To add to his past record of high finishes is the fact that Tringale also has a very nice record at Copperhead.
Tringale  ->  positive

Rickie Fowler getting his first is another. Johnson defending this tournament might be the biggest of all, though. The real question is not, "can he?"
Johnson  ->  positive

It takes a special player to have that belief, as only the world’s elite fill you with that confidence, but he is definitely amongst that list, even without that major title. Statistically Fowler ranks 49th in Strokes Gained Off-The-Tee and 14th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green which are two of the key areas this week. Fowler’s most impressive numbers are his ranking in Strokes Gained: Putting (1st) and Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green (11th).
Fowler  ->  positive

Patrick Reed ($9,500): Reed may not have the razor sharp approach game that Casey has but he should be a good fit this week regardless as he can make up strokes at this venue with his improving short game and putter. Reed has a boom or bust history at this event with two top-twenties and two missed cuts over his last four appearances but I’m comfortable using him here as the real American hero has only finished outside of the top 25 once in his last six starts. Kyle Stanley ($8,400): I’m not sure if Stanley necessarily has what it takes to win at this venue, but like Casey his approach game can be so good at times that a shaky putter shouldn’t matter too much.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Danny Lee, Webb Simpson, Jimmy Walker & Harris English – Lee’s the defending champ and comes in playing his best golf since that win two years ago. He’s made six cuts in a row with three Top 10s in that stretch… Sandwiched in between MC’s at the Greenbrier Classic, Webb has three Top 10s in his six career appearances at the Old White… Walker has an excellent history at the venue, he simply needs to get his whole game on one page. In a field of scrubs, it’s difficult to pass on his elite upside… English has a sneaky chance to win this week.
Walker  ->  positive

His game sets up well again this week and should be a consideration for tournament contests. -- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons.
Kirk  ->  positive

One of those victories came at the Utah Championship and he finished the season 8th for Greens in Regulation, 1st for Birdie Average, 1st for Scoring Average, 5th for Scrambling, 1st for Putting Average and 2nd for All-Round. Kizzire then hit the PGA Tour hard finishing 2nd here at TPC Summerlin and 4th at the CC of Jackson. Since then 8th at Torrey Pines (the 40+mph wind Sunday renewal!

Harris English – GPP – DK: $7000 FD: $7100  I will not be going anywhere near English in cash games but I do think he makes a great play to round out GPP lineups. English has recovered from his midseason missed cut stretch with 4/5 straight made cuts. Looking at his Vegas odds English stands out in his price range and I think he does without a crazy high level of ownership.
English  ->  positive

With enough experience at Augusta under his belt now, Ryan knows the track pretty much as well as anyone in the field and I believe the time has now come for him to move his game on to another level. RUSSELL HENLEY – 125-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 8 Finished 15th  As we have seen from Henley in his years on the tour he is not someone who wins two or three times a year but, when his game is on and he is in the hunt he is not afraid to mix it with the best and beat them. The Georgia native showed this in literally his first start on the PGA Tour as a fully fledged member when he spread eagled the field at the Sony Open to win with a score of -24.
Henley  ->  positive

I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Charl Schwartzel ($7,700)  For a while this season, Schwartzel was too cheap, and we made sure he was in our lineups.
Spieth  ->  positive

If he can keep the ball in short grass off the tee, Pieters looks good value to have a good week here. Branden Grace 40/1  The South African has been coming into some good form lately and has proven himself to be a great wind player. He finished T27 at The Masters at the end of April and followed that with a T11 at the RBC Heritage, a T10 in Texas and a respectable T24 in New Orleans.
Branden Grace  ->  positive

A player with major pedigree as good as Louis’ should always be considered and he will no doubt be ready for another big week at Augusta at what I consider a very fair price. J.B. Holmes 125/1 (Betfair 1-6 1/5 odds) or 90/1 Skybet (1-8 1/4 odds) 0.5pt e/w:  J.B. Holmes made 2/4 cuts in the majors last year, but when he did make the weekend he finished T4 at the Masters and a distant 3rd at the Open Championship. His T4 here last year came on his third start at Augusta, finishing 25th on debut in 2008 before missing the cut in 2015.
J.B. Holmes  ->  positive

England’s own Ian Poulter, and Poulter’s played inspired golf since almost losing his Tour card nearly three months ago. Yes, Poulter faltered down the stretch last week and finished a distant ninth at the Scottish Open, but he’s trending in the right direction and exhibiting the swagger of a player about to do something special. Poulter’s the kind of player who thrives on intensity, as evidenced by his Ryder Cup pedigree, and while social media gathered around the trash fire to celebrate what was supposed to be the end of his career, Poulter dug in and started playing some of his best golf in years.
Poulter,  ->  positive

He's certainly worth looking at for that event next week but don't miss out on him here. It's a tough front end of the market but there's five each-way places to go at and Kisner is certainly capable of hanging tough with the big guns if the putts drop. He finished 20th for Strokes Gained: Putting last season and third in 2016 so he's been one of the best around with the short-stick in recent years and that's a key asset on this course.
Kisner  ->  positive

Tie that in with the aforementioned 5th at Harbour Town where he finished well in the worst of the Sunday conditions and Webb clearly has momentum. 21st here in 2011, 4th in 2012 and 2nd in 2015 on his home course, Simpson also finished a half-decent 33rd here at the PGA Championship after shooting a +5/76 to take himself right out of it on Thursday before producing -2/211 across his final 54 holes. All of Webb's top 10s this year have come on Bermudagrass greens with 4th at Waialae, 5th at PGA National and 8th at Copperhead over and above Harbour Town, plus all featured positive Strokes Gained Putting displays.
Simpson  ->  positive

Looks like a good time to jump back on. Jordan Spieth – $11,100  Spieth has disappointed in his last two events, missing the cut at the Valspar and not making it out of the group stage of the WGC Matchplay. People will be hesitant to play Spieth, despite being the third highest priced player, because of his poor recent form and with Augusta looming right around the corner.

If I were playing #pga #dfs this week I would have Fowler in 100% my line ups. He is #1 in my @TFFDFS rankings. Matsu and Stenson high too.

Fantasy Golf: Top DraftKings Picks for the PGA Championship  August 05, 2017 Dustin Diez  Sharelines Rory McIlroy, Daniel Berger lead our top #DraftKings fantasy golf plays for the PGA Championship. #PGAChamp  The 2017 PGA Championship tees off at Quail Hollow Club on Thursday, setting up another exciting week of fantasy golf at DraftKings. In our final PGA preview of the season, we look at how to attack the course, as well as some of the top picks to target and some sleepers to target for your teams.
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Haas has played Firestone seven times over his career, and he has two finishes inside the top 20, with his career best being a T7 back in 2013. It’s worth noting, however, that Haas does seem to set up well for the course based on his season-long stats which include ranking sixth in Par 4 Efficiency from 450-500 yards and also being inside the top-10 in Bogey Avoidance. While he may not be a huge threat to win, Haas’s record at big events this year, and his solid statistical ranks, means he is definitely capable of a big week here and deserves consideration as a nice value on DraftKings this week given his meager salary.
Haas  ->  positive

Anytime a shorter course like this is played on the PGA Tour, finding fairways and hitting short-iron approaches close (50-125 yards) are essentials to scoring. It’s no surprise two-time champs Justin Thomas (2015 & 2016) and Ryan Moore (2013 & 2014) were dominant in these categories when they won here. As a starting point, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green is an excellent broad-scope ballstriking stat this week, followed by more specific indicators of driving accuracy and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green.
Justin Thomas  ->  positive

6 of the last 9 winners have been in the top-7 for fairways hit, but high Greens in Regulation numbers are even more important as 4 of the last 7 winners were in the top 2 across GIR% category on their way to victory. Comfortable Bermudagrass putters Jordan Spieth and Bill Haas were the outlying Greens in Regulation performers of recent winners, finishing 9th and 11th in that category respectively. Since the 2008 Rees Jones re-design, Henrik Stenson holds the tournament winning lowest total with -13/267 in an event that featured softened greens on the Sunday.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here. We know low scoring is Reed’s forte, with three of his five wins coming by way of double-digit scores.
Reed  ->  positive

Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Dustin Johnson – $12,200  Talking about the top player in the world in an extremely weak field, how original. Let’s just say that people are worried about Dustin Johnson’s game and his long trip over from Royal Birkdale to play in an event he probably could care less about.
Dustin Johnson  ->  positive

Fowler also happens to be a great putter, but great putting has not been a requirement for winning at PGA National. That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance."
Fowler  ->  positive

Let's start with course horses this week:  Jordan Spieth (RUNNER-UP-WIN-T3)  Dustin Johnson (Five top 10s in seven starts)  Hideki Matsuyama (T3-RUNNER-UP)  Rickie Fowler (T6-5)  Justin Thomas (T21-WIN)  Brooks Koepka (T3)  Pat Perez (T10-T3)  Jason Dufner (T18-5-21)  Billy Horschel (T6-T22)  Kevin Kisner (9th)    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Dustin Johnson  Jon Rahm  Hideki Matsuyama  Rickie Fowler  Patrick Cantlay  Brooks Koepka  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we have quite a bit of overlap: Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Thomas, and Brooks Koepka. I think Spieth is the standout pick here but not necessarily the correct OAD play.
Jordan Spieth  ->  positive

Eagle Point was a windy affair with technical level scoring where Perez excelled and the Scottsdale, Arizona resident also shot an impressive -7/65 in the 3rd Round at TPC Sawgrass when the wind was at its strongest. At a career high 40th in the OWGR, Perez has always been comfortable here at the classical Colonial with 4th in 2007, 6th in 2008, 10th in 2010, and 5th on his last outing here in 2015. He's also finished in the top 10 at every PGA Tour Texas venue which again highlights a player who performs well in windy conditions.
Perez  ->  positive

He won by masterfully playing the angles of the course, not to mention leading the field in strokes gained putting and finishing third in both scrambling and proximity to the hole (the greens are enormous, and simply doing well at GIR won't cut it). Reed was not even in the top-15 in SGP, but he was second in scrambling. So while it rarely hurts to hit it far off the tee -- which is why we tab driving distance as a key stat this week -- you'll be best served by focusing on short-game skill and putting.
Reed  ->  positive

Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
Mickelson  ->  negative

We also saw two rookies(Cody Gribble & John Rahm) get their first wins, a 23-year veteran(Rod Pampling) get his first win in 11 years and two other players (Pat Perez & Brendan Steele) getting their first wins in 5+ years. And most recently, we have seen the #5(Hideki Matsuyama) and #6(Jordan Spieth) players in the world win the last two tournaments. Oh Canada!
#6(Jordan Spieth)  ->  positive

Main bets: Chappell 33-1 An 56-1 List 60-1 Cam Smith 110-1 DK article here, already added Curtis Luck... https://t.co/CDCTVal9Fh
List  ->  positive

The latter three are all outside the top 120 in the world rankings, so if they can....    Oosthuizen didn't have his best stuff at the Masters (T41) but had been in decent nick before that while Grace has improved from T27 at Augusta National to T11 at The Heritage (like this, a Pete Dye track) before T10 in last week's Texas Open. In fact, Futureoffantasy.com's list of top 25 performers on Pete Dye courses shows Grace ranked 8th while he's third in the table measuring his Pete Dye numbers against Expected Strokes Gained elsewhere. It's Bermuda greens at TPC Louisiana and Oosthuizen performs relatively better on such surfaces than he does on other grass types.
Grace  ->  positive

Jonathan Coachman -- Jordan Spieth ($10,600)  Last year, Spieth came to the Tour Championship not in form and he promptly left the field behind, making Henrik Stenson look average. I think Spieth gets two straight at East Lake and sets the stage for a huge 2017. Spieth is my guy this week.
Spieth  ->  positive

The Englishman has not done the best job of capitalizing on his opportunities the past couple of years, but he’s continued to put himself in the mix week after week this season and has now recorded eight straight finishes of 26th or better coming into the final major (including a T5 from last week). Casey has shown a complete game tee to green in 2017, and comes in ranking eighth on the season in Strokes Gained: Approaches and 15th in Strokes Gained: Around the Greens. While his form at Quail Hollow isn’t spectacular, having only played here once since 2011 (T41 last season), means we can’t really weigh it against him very heavily.
Casey  ->  positive

He led the SGP stats last week at the Plantation Course which is a big plus coming to Waialae this week. Zach Johnson 33/1  Zach is showing some good early season form and hasn’t finished worse that T23 in his last three starts. He played well at the Safeway Open finishing a respectable T13 and followed that with a T23 at the OHL Classic.
Zach  ->  positive

It means he's 26-under for his last five rounds at Kapalua." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 5 places  Main Bet: Back Rickie Fowler e.w. @ 7/1  Being an American with a sharp and imaginative short game certainly seems to be the common thread when looking at past winners of the calendar year-opening Sentry Tournament of Champions.
Rickie Fowler  ->  positive

If he can keep it up – and he’s shown no signs of stopping – he’s easily one of the best values on the board this week. BARGAIN BIN  Bill Haas ($6,900) – In this range, you have to take what you can get, and I’ll gladly take the experience and track record of Bill Haas. Forget the British – it’s completely irrelevant here, and Haas has been pretty outstanding otherwise, including some rather strong finishes at this event over the past five years.
Haas  ->  positive

But I'm more than happy to go into battle with Simpson, Kisner and Schniederjans. Jason Dufner showed up well last week when perhaps not expected to and this is a more suitable test for him (T9 two years ago). Charles Howell, who has a ridiculous amount of good finishes here (seven top fives and lots of other top 15s) is certainly a candidate for a Top 5 while Zach Johnson loves this place and is a former winner.
Kisner  ->  positive

Villegas does have some fairly recent form, finishing runner-up at Sea Island in his final 2016 event, and was only beaten eight shots in the Phoenix on his penultimate start. As with McGirt, the plan is to place two lay orders, for 12 units at [15.0] and 20 units at [3.0], to secure an overall profit should either hit just the first target. Back Martin Flores (w/o Scott/Fowler/Garcia) 1u ew @ 110/1  Back Martin Flores for a Top 20 Finish 2u @ 5/1  Rather than another back-to-lay, the final pick is preferred as an each-way selection in our speciality market excluding the top-three contenders - Adam Scott, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia.
McGirt,  ->  positive

This wouldn’t quite be a Billy Horschel story of coming out of nowhere to win, but Casey would be a surprise winner, and makes for a good 2nd golfer in lineups this week. Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Surprisingly, Rose has only played here three times in his career but those three appearances have yielded two top-7 finishes and he looks in good enough to form to build on that success this week. Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event. It wasn’t to be for Rose that week though as he limped to a disappointing 48th place finish, much below his usual high standards.
Rose  ->  positive

Sony Open: Brian Stuard and Brian Gay, both 125/1. Well they do say two Brians are better than one
Brian Stuard  ->  positive

The BBC lost the event to Sky prior to last year's renewal and as much of a shame as it is to see any live sport lost from terrestrial TV, the coverage 12 months ago was so good that Sky was awarded a BAFTA! Last Ten Winners  2016 - Henrik Stenson -20  2015 - Zach Johnson -15 (playoff)  2014 - Rory McIlroy -17  2013 - Phil Mickelson -3  2012 - Ernie Els -7  2011 - Darren Clarke -5  2010 - Louis Oosthuizen -16  2009 - Stewart Cink -2 (playoff)  2008 - Padraig Harrington +3  2007 - Padraig Harrington -7 (playoff)      What Will it Take to Win the Open Championship? The logical place to start is with the 2008 edition at Royal Birkdale, so here are the stats for the first five and ties.
Padraig Harrington  ->  positive

Going back to the fall swing season, Stanley has only missed two cuts (Honda and OHL Classic), and has been one of the best on Tour in terms of tee-to-green (5th) and Bogey Avoidance (12th). Where Stanley has struggled immensely is with the flatstick in hand, ranking 165th in SG: Putting, but he’s elite in almost every other factor on the way to the green. He’s hit the 2nd-most greens in regulation (73.08%), sits 5th in Proximity to the Hole, and 6th in overall SG: Approach.
Stanley  ->  positive

Jason Sobel -- Alex Cejka ($8,300)  From Ryan Moore to Charley Hoffman to Scott Piercy, there are a handful of Vegas residents in this week's field, but my pick is the guy who was part of the runner-up logjam at this event last year. Cejka had a decent finish at the CIMB Classic two weeks ago and he should be accustomed to desert golf. On a week when just finishing Low Vegas Resident is an accomplishment, I like Cejka to take it.
Alex Cejka  ->  positive

He seems to have more experience this time around and could be another man to watch here. Luke List 50/1  List opened with a respectable T26 at the Safeway Open and followed that with five top 15’s in a row which started with a T2 at The Sanderson Farms Championship. He had another good week at the Shriners Open in Vegas finishing T15 which included a final round 64 and finished T7 the following week at the OHL Classic.
Luke List  ->  positive

As a 21-year-old still finding his way in professional golf, it was an out-of-this-world performance, surrounded as he was by links specialists with bags of experience. Muirfield was the last really demanding Open test so the fact it represents Matsuyama's best finish is a positive, although he fared well enough in 2014 and 2015 before struggling last year when arriving in no form and carrying an injury. This time, he comes to the Open with links preparation in the bag courtesy of a top-15 finish in the Irish Open and as one of the most reliable drivers in world golf, there's every hope that he can keep out of trouble and allow his deadly iron play to pick apart the golf course.
Matsuyama's  ->  positive

4th at Montreux (again features Poa Annua) in 2017 also interests as Vaughn Taylor is a 2-time winner there. But it's Hoge's form this season which jumps from the page. 7th at TPC Summerlin was the pre-cursor to the Sony Open where the 28 year-old shot 65-65-64 to lead after 54 holes.
Hoge's  ->  positive

22nd at the PGA Championship was his first Major as a professional and it's worth remembering that a 1st Round 68 was good enough for 3rd place, which he backed up with a 69 in the 3rd Round, seeing him in 6th spot after 54 holes. 68-67-68 on his debut at TPC Boston saw Murray again in the very heat of the battle come Sunday, mixing it with Thomas, Spieth, Leishman and Rahm, before a final round collapse to 25th. Undoubtedly he's not the finished article, but at an event this week which is low-key and with a game where he's hitting plenty of greens and putting superbly, I could see the power-hitting World Number 93 in the mix in California.
Rahm,  ->  positive

Henley’s form this year has been a little patchy however he seemed to click at just the right time when he closed with a 65 yesterday in Houston to finish in 8th place. So we’ve established Henley is running in to form at the right time however what makes him really jump of the page this week is his progressive form figures at Augusta. In four starts in The Masters Russell has gone MC, 31, 21, 11.
Russell  ->  positive

In the two European Tour events he has played in 2017 (both in February) he has finished T19 at the Dubai Desert Classic and T7 last week in the Maybank Malaysian Open. Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready.
Lahiri  ->  positive

Puerto Rico Open 🔥 takes: - Uihlein picks up the win - Varner with a top ten - Power with a top 20 - Flores with a top 25
Uihlein  ->  positive

He’s averaged 4.30 birdies on the Tour this year, has an overall birdie or better% of 24.44%, and although he’s not incredible at avoiding bogeys, a large part of that is from his 3-putting numbers. Beyond those 3-putt numbers, Pieters has been a stud on greens this year – if he had enough tracked rounds, he’d currently rank 16th in SG: Putting. He struggles on longer putts but has been nails inside 10’ (90.87%), so with his approach game he’ll give himself some birdie opportunities on the greens.
Pieters  ->  positive

Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Daniel Berger ($11,300) – Part of me is disturbed by the idea of paying this much for Berger, but when there isn’t too much trouble for him on the track, he can absolutely run over the field with his superb T2G play and plus putter. If you’re going to pay up, I think this is the way to go.
Berger  ->  positive

From a statistical standpoint, Finau ranks fairly highly in the important areas this week, particularly in Par 4 Scoring (4th) and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (6th). Finau also ranks 21st in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green and whilst he has seemingly struggled on the 450-500 yard Par 4’s (78th), I am confident he can post another strong finish around this track. At 50/1 you are getting a player in good form, with quality course form to boot.
Finau  ->  positive

Bill Haas – $9,100  Boring Bill Haas is flying under the radar once again. Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green.
Haas  ->  positive

Seeing him in contention and eventually finishing inside the top-10 at Quail Hollow was enough for me to believe he can win this week, especially given his form on the correlating courses. Day has three top-10’s including a 2nd and a 3rd in his seven starts at Augusta National, whilst he also finished T24 and T4 at the 2012 and 2016 Barclays respectively. Day has won twice in the last nine play-off appearances he has now withdrawn from, with five more top-10’s and two top-15’s in the other six appearances.
Day  ->  positive

Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us. His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s.
Casey  ->  positive

I will be using Casey in both formats. Charley Hoffman ($7,900): Although Hoffman came back to life at the PGA, he remains a solid play again this week at this price. Hoffman ranks 5th in Par 4 Scoring, 6th in SG: Putting, 13th in BoB% and 15th in SG: T2G.
Hoffman  ->  positive

And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
List  ->  positive

Other: Alex Noren (11th ranked player in the world, won at altitude last year)  High Upside Tournament Picks  Jason Dufner ($8,100): Coming off a decent week and his best finish on the year (14th) Dufner is the type of player I want to target this week as he’s great at finding the fairway with driver—11th in accuracy this year. Dufner’s had success at similar styled venues to this week as well and at $8,100 his price should drive people off him. Byeong-Hun An ($7,500): Great young player who took down a strong field in 2015 on another tree-lined venue at Wentworth.
Jason Dufner  ->  positive

Instead, we are getting Day as only the seventh most expensive golfer on the slate, at an event he has not finished worse than T4 at the past three seasons. What’s also encouraging from his last start is that Day finished the week eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee and third in Driving Distance, suggesting he may finally have found some consistency with his driver, a club that has given him issues all season. Coming off a bit of an embarrassing finish, into an event and time of year he clearly likes, I like Day for a big week here and to hopefully nab his long overdue first win of the year.
Day  ->  positive

Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format. Even though he's coming off a victory at the Valspar Championship and a personal trip to England to pay his respects to the loss of a friend, Paul Casey is the third member of the threesome on my short list.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Rory’s history at the Masters would be incomplete without mentioning 2011: Despite leading the tournament after each one of the first three rounds — and by four shots to start the final round — Mcllroy shot a Masters-worst 80 in the final round, finishing T15. Vegas Odds  Rory hasn’t been anything special with double-digit odds to win:  Of his 26 tournaments with at least 10 percent odds, McIlroy has posted 100 DraftKings points or more in nine and failed to meet his salary-based expectations in 12. And his ownership in these events has been high.
Rory  ->  positive

[Writer’s Note: #MyEditorThoughtThisSpotWasReservedForHumbleBragging] [Editor’s Note: Only editors get to make notes.] Humpnostication Prognostication  If I were a skill game proposition guy, I would put my Coors Lite on Adam Scott ($10,300). He won here in 2005 and has been the runner-up at Rivera twice, including last year.
Adam Scott  ->  positive

I am willing to overlook his previous course form here, as I believe like others before him, he can put the past in his rear-view mirror on this course and get himself into contention for win number one. Chesson Hadley 110/1 (Bet365 5 places 1/4 odds) & 100/1 (Skybet 8 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Chesson Hadley is the one player who really jumps out at me this week and I was pleased to see he was three-figures. He had a very strong start to the season and has petered up and down in form since, with a missed cut last time out ensuring longer odds on him this week.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Spieth has really not felt like he’s been in”Spieth Mode.” HOWEVER, he has quietly not missed a top 10 this season. I think his putting is quickly getting back into business, and, with the score fest that is Pebble Beach, I look at Spieth as one of the safest cash plays you can make. He’s about as safe a play as I can think in this price range.
in”Spieth  ->  positive

As mentioned, Lingmerth’s first Tour win came over at the Memorial Tournament, an event hosted by Jack Nicklaus, and I think the prospects of a legends-of-the-game double are considerably higher than the odds imply. The next man on my list is the one Lingmerth got the better of for his sole success to date – and that’s Justin Rose. Truth be told, I’d already settled on the headline selection before reading what Rose had to say about a potential link between this event and the one at Muirfield Village: “It reminds me of the Memorial which happens to be Jack’s tournament.”  While the two layouts may not look similar on TV, there are certain leaderboard ties between them and while links are often there if you really want to find them, in this instance they come via the likes of Every (6th at Muirfield Village), Mark Wilson and Matt Jones.
Rose.  ->  positive

World’s No. 1 Dustin Johnson, coming off a career best showing at TPC Sawgrass is playing for the third consecutive week. He’s joined by fellow Top 10ers Jason Day (4), Sergio Garcia (5), and Jordan Spieth (6).
Dustin Johnson,  ->  positive

Don’t overthink it, just back him knowing he’s good value until he eventually has a bad week. Brian Harman 150/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  Brian Harman is enjoying a good season so far on the PGA Tour and thru nine events has only missed two cuts. One of those missed cuts came in the season-opener, the Safeway Open in October and the other at the RSM Classic in November.
Brian Harman  ->  positive

Thomas has taken a little bit longer to find his stride compared to the dual major winner but his time has arrived to join the absolute elite of the game after a golden couple of months around the turn of the year hoisted him up to number 10 in the world rankings. A successful defence of his title at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia was followed by successive victories in Hawaii (with a 59 while playing with Spieth thrown in along the way) and pinpointed Thomas as a player who is going to win at regular intervals. A resident now in Florida, the Stadium Course really gets his juices flowing and he could not be more glowing in his praise for the layout.
Thomas  ->  positive

I won't be using him on FanDuel at his price but on DraftKings I think he makes an excellent target in all formats. Top Current Form Targets  Luke List  World Golf Ranking (#53)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($10,000)  FanDuel ($10,900)    Since missing three straight earlier in the season, Luke List has been playing some terrific golf and tops the form list week both from an average finish and DraftKings scoring standpoint. He has made eight straight cuts with no finish worse than a T26 with three Top 10's and over his last five events, leads all players in the field with an average of 85.8 DraftKings points per event.
Luke List  ->  positive

Furyk, for instance, should have won both; Webb Simpson has lost a play-off for both; Chris Kirk and Heath Slocum have won the RSM and contended for the RBC, just like Kisner. Given that the RSM Classic remains in its infancy, the ties between leaderboards have been established rapidly and Kisner can become the first man to win both having recaptured his best form this year, including when going down by a single stroke in the Arnold Palmer Invitational last month. I thought he was unlucky at Bay Hill, even if as a backer at 66/1 I'd love to blame him for everything that went wrong.
Kisner.  ->  positive

More recently, he demonstrated a different quality in producing Saturday fireworks to open up a four-shot lead in the Honda Classic, before defying a difficult start to the final round as he ultimately won by the same margin in an important, confidence-boosting win, almost exactly a year since he lost a play-off for the Phoenix Open having appeared to be similarly in control. While far from being one of the most prestigious events on the calendar, Phoenix was very important to Fowler and defeat to Hideki Matsuyama in front of his friends and family hit him hard. In fact, I strongly suspect it had a lasting impact, enough to in part explain some of his disappointing performances in majors last year.
Fowler  ->  positive

However, we may start our lineups below Rahm if playing cash. Value Plays:  Brendan Steele $7,800 – The Steele Curtain may have one of our least favorite golf swings on the PGA Tour (seriously, watch his swing…so ugly), but you can’t argue it’s effectiveness. He’s a California guy who’s familiar putting on these Poa Annua putting surfaces.
Brendan Steele  ->  positive

Kyle Stanley won the Quicken Loans National last month, has finished sixth here before and is a Phoenix winner (2012) and I'm also chancing this year's Shell winner, Russell Henley, who, as he very often does, looks to have been overlooked in the market given his incredible short game. Selections:  Hideki Matsuyama @ [13.5]  Brooks Koepka @ [30.0]  Daniel Berger @ [65.0]  Xander Schauffele @ [150.0]  Russel Henley @ [230.0]  Adam Hadwin @ [230.0]  Kyle Stanley @ [270.0]  Jhonattan Vegas @ [290.0]  Hudson Swafford @ [430.0]    I'll be back this evening or tomorrow with a look at some of the side markets and I'll kick off the In-Play Blog on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
Daniel Berger  ->  positive

Marc Leishman  MY PICK : Martin Kaymer ($9,500)  Martin Kaymer hasn’t won since his victory at the U.S. Open in 2014, but he does have a great streak of 28 starts without a missed cut going and should generally be considered the class of a fairly weak field this week. While the lack of wins may be concerning, the fact that Kaymer has two of the biggest wins of his career on other classic Pete Dye venues — Whistling Straights and Sawgrass — gives you extra hope that this could be the venue where he breaks his current goose-egg. Tee to green, Kaymer has been just fine this year (27th on tour over 12 measured rounds), and the fact he’s coming off his best Masters finish ever (T16), by a wide margin, should give the German a huge boost of confidence.
Martin Kaymer  ->  positive

George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
Kizzire  ->  positive

Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (33rd)  Vegas Odds (25/1)  Draftkings ($10,300)  FantasyAces ($5,800)  I start things off this week with what I feel will be a terrific GPP pivot, contrarian option. It feels like a very scary pick as Molinari hasn't played a professional round since late November but I am going to trust my cheatsheet this week where he sits in the #2 spot.
Francesco Molinari  ->  positive

Although both played well and made the top 10, maybe a more restful week would have been better. Certainly, Schwartzel's mood appeared to be up and down and that doesn't bode well. So, we're left with just two players.
Schwartzel's  ->  positive

According to FantasyNational, Spieth is seventh in the field in his past 24 rounds in strokes gained: approach among players in the field. There's no guarantee that Spieth hits fairways, but if the wind isn't problematic, he has the profile to dominate. Sergio Garcia ($9,400 | 18/1) - Garcia's odds have shortened from 20/1 as of Friday to 18/1, but his FanDuel price is locked in.
Spieth  ->  positive

Statswise he also ticks the boxes here ranking ninth in driving accuracy, fourth in GIR, eighth in SGP, third in par 4 scoring and 13th in par 5 scoring. Final selections –  Gary Woodland 1pt EW  Alex Noren 1pt EW  Tyrell Hatton 1pt EW  Brian Harman 1pt EW  Total staked = 8 pts  *Some bookies paying 7 places*  Good luck and enjoy the golf. Doublebogey6
Brian Harman  ->  positive

He ranks 15th in driving distance, first in SGP, 11th in SGTTG, fifth in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a near winner last week Day could go one better and win in style this week. Patrick Reed 25/1  The young American really stepped up to the plate last week and got the job done in Bethpage with a great win.
Day  ->  positive

Given its altitude, Chapultepec will play much less than the scorecard yardage of 7,330 yards (well under 7,000 in fact) so it has to be relevant that Woodland has second places on shorter tracks at the OHL Classic on his last trip to Mexico and the CIMB Classic (twice runner-up) in Malaysia. Those courses measure 6,987 and 7,005 yards respectively so it's simply not true that Woodland needs a beast of a course to show off his length. He can pick and choose his moments (perhaps try and drive a few short par fours) and use other parts of his game and brain over brawn elsewhere.
Woodland  ->  positive

Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
Haas  ->  positive

According to FanShareSports.com, Day is the 29th most tagged golfer so far this week and is the only golfer above $9K with single digit tags. In a week where there will be a ton of fresh faces to DFS golf due to the increase in contest sizes, Day makes for a fantastic GPP play. People will look at his recent form, combined with the recent form of golfers around him and steer clear.
Day  ->  positive

As the day wore on the air appeared heavier and making birdies wasn't quite as easy as it had been when Holmes embarked on his final round. All the stars aligned for Holmes, as they had done for Jones 12 months earlier and in the fullness of time, these two results could well be viewed upon as freakish. Prior to 2014, Adam Scott in 2007, who benefited from a late Stuart Appleby collapse, had been the only winner not to be within two of the lead with a round to go and every winner bar Holmes has been inside the top-four places after 54 holes.
Holmes  ->  positive

As is the case for most of the guys in this write-up, List struggles with the putter but did gain 3.6 strokes on Waialae's greens a year ago, resulting in a 13th-place finish. Andrew Landry ($8,100 | 160) - Spending down on too many options probably isn't necessary this week when we need only six golfers, so don't go too heavy on the punt plays. But you can consider Landry, who finished fourth at the RSM in his most recent action.
Andrew Landry  ->  positive

Instead, I'll turn to Paul Casey at 30/1. I have a slight feeling I'm playing him at not great odds and expecting something around T5 but surely Casey will throw in something really big soon. Three of his rounds at Royal Birkdale were 67-68-68 so he's doing an awful lot right; the problem is not putting all four together and a Friday 78 on his birthday really did for him at The Open although T11 was still a fine week.
Casey  ->  positive

When you weigh it all up its hard not to fancy Rickie’s chances here in Erin Hills. Jon Rahm 20/1  Big hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm has made quite an impact on the PGA Tour this season with a win and seven top 10’s under his belt so far. After shooting a final round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open in February, Rahm bagged his first PGA Tour win at previous US Open venue, Torrey Pines, finishing on 13 under par in total.
Jon Rahm  ->  positive

Jon Rahm ($9,600) – He’s just impossible to ignore. He might be getting to a price point where it’s hard to imagine paying up for him instead of someone with the pedigree of a Justin Rose (more below), but Rahm is one of those players who, when he plays well, isn’t just a great real-life player – he’s the perfect fantasy option. When he is hot, he is a birdie-making machine, as evidenced by his career birdie-or-better % that was better than the number Dustin Johnson put up last season.
Justin Rose  ->  positive

The Masters Tournament, April 6th to 9th 2017  Introduction:  Best Prices - Top Debutant Market: Jon Rahm @ 11/4 (Bet Victor) Tyrrell Hatton @ 5/1 Thomas Pieters @ 8/1 (Betfred) Adam Hadwin @ 8/1 (Bet365) Tommy Fleetwood @ 9/1 (Betfred) Alex Norén @ 11/1 Hudson Swafford @ 20/1 (Betfred) William McGirt @ 25/1 Jeunghun Wang @ 25/1 Curtis Luck @ 45/1 (Betfred) Si-Woo Kim @ 50/1 Daniel Summerhays @ 50/1 (Stan James) Mackenzie Hughes @ 50/1 (Bet Victor) Billy Hurley III @ 66/1 (Stan James) Brian Stuard @ 66/1 (Stan James) Scott Gregory @ 150/1 (Stan James) Brad Dalke @ 150/1 (Stan James) Stewart Hagestad @ 125/1 Toto Gana @ 150/1    Top Pick:  My Selections:  The world's top golfers descend upon Augusta National this week for the 81st Masters Tournament. Following the Shell Houston Open in Texas, Russell Henley booked the final spot in this year's opening major championship and nineteen rookies will drive down Magnolia Lane for the first time. It has been an exciting opening six months to the PGA Tour season with four first time winners securing invitations to The Masters.
Hudson Swafford  ->  positive

All that’s been holding Russell back so far this year is the putter and I am hopeful that a return to Bermuda greens on a course he obviously loves will see an upturn on that front, and if this is the case I am sure he will have a big week. ALEX NOREN – 40-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 FINISHED 3rd  If you’re looking for an inform ball striker who has a pedigree of performing well in links/windy conditions you don’t have to look much further than Alex Noren. Noren is a nine time winner on the European tour with 5 of those coming in the past two years and he currently sits 16th in the OWGR.
NOREN  ->  positive

I think Haas falls into the middle of the pack ownership wise and I am comfortable being overweight on that number. If he can straighten out the drive Haas is a player I think sets up great for when winds pick up as he can stay in contention in the rough weather through his scrambling ability. Brian Harman – Play  I think Harman probably falls under Bello, Berger and Kisner in terms of ownership but still sees people on him.
Haas  ->  positive

He comes in 12th overall in my model this week due to his lower ranks in Par 4 Scoring(64th) and BoB%(47th) but ranks 13th in SG: OTT + APP which really draws my attention this week. Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win.
Patrick Reed  ->  positive

Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Patton Kizzire, $10000 – Kizzire has made the cut both times in La Quinta, but his real appeal lies in his two wins already this season, his last coming in a marathon playoff with James Hahn last week. Though there may be some fatigue after a long week and long flight back to the U.S. Mainland, Kizzire should be good to make the cut and potentially get himself back into contention yet another week. Charles Howell III, $10000 – With four top-15s and eight cuts made in his last eight trips to the California desert, Howell is an ironclad pick to make the cut with potential for much more.
Kizzire,  ->  positive

As for his putting, it seems the switch to a TaylorMade Spider has had a very positive effect and, even last year, he was decent on these Las Colinas greens, finishing 18th in Putts Per Round. Kang is 24th in Par 4 Performance this year which is another good pointer and, on a course where you can go low, it's worth remembering that he shot a 60 at Monterey Peninsula in the second round of another AT&T event, the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The 29-year-old, who was T18 in last year's US Open, is 66/1 here and that looks too big when you consider how well he performs in windy Texas conditions.
Kang  ->  positive

Eagle Point was a windy affair with technical level scoring where Perez excelled and the Scottsdale, Arizona resident also shot an impressive -7/65 in the 3rd Round at TPC Sawgrass when the wind was at its strongest. At a career high 40th in the OWGR, Perez has always been comfortable here at the classical Colonial with 4th in 2007, 6th in 2008, 10th in 2010, and 5th on his last outing here in 2015. He's also finished in the top 10 at every PGA Tour Texas venue which again highlights a player who performs well in windy conditions.
Perez  ->  positive

Kisner has been excellent on par-4s this year, sitting T42 in overall par-4 performance and 47th in par-4 Birdie or Better percentage (17.60%). He’s achieved this mostly be being deadly accurate off the tee (68.47%) and picking great landing areas, because Kisner has never been much of a bomber – his average drive is only 288.7 yards. Luckily, KIZ also excels from a distance, ranking 17th, 49th, and 21st in approach shots from 150-175, 175-200, and above 200 respectively.
Kisner  ->  positive

When finishing 13th in 2015, Rose ranked 6th in SG: Approach and 9th in SG: Tee-to-Green so he struck the ball extremely well and it was just his short game that let him down that week. Rose ranked 43rd in SG: Putting and 57th in SG: Around-the-Green, which was the difference between him contending. In his last two starts, Rose has ranked 29th (Northern Trust) and 3rd (Dell Tech) in SG: Around-the-Green, so his play around the greens seems to coming round at the right time.
Rose  ->  positive

He is an absolute bargain under $9,500 on both sites. Jordan Spieth  World Golf Ranking (#5)  Vegas Odds (12/1)  Draftkings ($10,800)  FanDuel ($9,700)  You thought I was going to forget out Spieth, didn't you? Can't have a stats section centered around approach shots without talking about Spieth.
Spieth  ->  positive

  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
Garcia,  ->  negative

Furthermore, Finau is a player who has continually gained strokes tee-to-green during that stretch. The value is there on DraftKings and I will be all over Finau in both formats. Gary Woodland – GPP – DK: $7000 FD: $6500  Woodland is a great value (on both sites) given his 70/1 odds to win the tournament.
Finau  ->  positive

Rory McIlroy has had solid finishes at the masters over the past four years, with his lowest finish being 25th. His finishes are not as solid as Spieth, but his statistics come in a little bit higher as he has been in solid form for 2017. McIlroy is a little better pick than Spieth because of his ability to go for the green and get eagles on par 5’s, but either would be a solid top level pick.
Spieth,  ->  positive

Clearly hungry for more wins and with correlating course form across Torrey Pines (1st), Pebble Beach (5th), Congressional (3rd) and TPC Scottsdale (5th), the 22 year old's ability to learn courses amazingly quickly could come in very handy this week. His current form reminds me of Jordan Spieth in 2015 (who made the play-off) and I can see the Rahm charge continuing all the way to Magnolia Lane. RESULT: T10  Charley Hoffman 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  The first name that jumped off the entry list for me was Charley Hoffman who I think will go well again in his beloved Texas.
Rahm  ->  positive

Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus. They are:  Chesson Hadley (5th in SG: Approach)  Ollie Schniederjans (12th in SG: Approach)  Chris Kirk (19th in SG: Approach)  Course experience is helpful here, although Woodland did win in debut in 2011, but course form is general is not a sticking point. Another thing to bear in mind this week is the sheer amount of Par 3’s (five) as well as four Par 5’s.
Chesson Hadley  ->  positive

Of all those trading in and around 50/1 and below, he stuck out like a sore thumb and I'd have had him quite a bit shorter. My only other pick at this stage is Fabian Gomez, who really should have won the event four years ago. The Argentine messed up the final hole when in command in 2013 but he was still a maiden then and he's won twice since.
Fabian Gomez,  ->  positive
