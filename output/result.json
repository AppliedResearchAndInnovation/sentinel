Hadwin lines up well for the par 70 track and does so at a reasonable price on DraftKings. Comparing his Vegas odds to his price point in the VIP PGA Spreadsheet we can see Hadwin is either mispriced by DraftKings or Vegas and I think I know which one is wrong.","entity":"hadwin ","neu":0.07922567928597211},{"neg":4.946351227719922E-7,"sentiment":"positive","pos":0.9735117139300307,"tweet":"Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Boo Weekley; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Steve Alker \/ Ryan Moore \/ Steve Stricker; 7) Spencer Levin; 8) Ben Crane \/ Kyle Stanley; 10) Chad Campbell; 11) Tim Wilkinson; 12) Zac Blair \/ Daniel Summerhays; 14) Scott Brown; 15) Nick Taylor; 16) Zach Johnson \/ Johnson Wagner; 18) Kevin Kisner \/ William McGirt; 20) Danny Lee \/ J.J.

Henley was defending his title at the Houston Open last week and whilst he was quiet on Friday and Saturday, Henley played well on Thursday (69) and Sunday (65) to finish a respectable T8, perfect preparation once again for this week. He will need to improve in keeping bogeys off his card, never ranking higher than 16th in that department in the three starts he\u2019s made the weekend, but now making his fifth start at Augusta, he should have a better understanding of how to do just that.","entity":"henley ","neu":0.10966145616424196}]
