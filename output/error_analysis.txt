7625	7625	24	24	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively. They’re historically pricey while DJ is around his average; that should affect ownership, and indeed DJ is projected for the most ownership this week at 26-30 percent in our Models.
10274	10274	61	77	target: Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J. Choi, J.B. Holmes and Stewart Cink and you have an event that seems pretty accessible to almost everyone.
12781	12781	11	12	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charl Schwartzel: 30th Houston/47th Bay Hill/24th Doral/14th PGA National/8th Abu Dhabi. Phil Mickelson: 35th Houston/30th Bay Hill/14th Doral/24th TPC Scottsdale. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their wave and winning score since 2010.
3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
13214	13214	12	12	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below are the golfers who fit it this week. Casey  Kuchar  Harman  Cook  Glover  Landry  The top three aren’t a surprise, but the bottom three may test the trend! Cook, Glover, and especially Landry, don’t have the sharpest form coming into this week.
122	122	12	12	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson, Spieth, Mickelson, Walker and Koepka have all safely qualified. Holmes, Watson, Kuchar, Fowler and Furyk amongst those down to 22nd in the current standings (see above) still have a shot at qualifying automatically this week. From there Davis Love III announces 3 of his 4 Captain's Picks after the BMW Championship (3rd of 4 events), with his final selection being announced after the Tour Championship.
10406	10406	12	13	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus. Nine Bridges: Justin Thomas; EW Places: Leishman, Cam Smith, Whee Kim, Brown, Lahiri, List, Lovemark. TPC Summerlin: Patrick Cantlay; EW Places: Whee Kim, Cejka, Hadley, Kizzire, Hossler, Hoge Bradley, DeChambeau.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
5464	5464	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  See above. You have to drop down to Kevin Chappell at $8,800 for a player approaching what Mickelson brings to the table. He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints.
10205	10205	13	14	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, it may be enough to keep other owners away. -- Zach Turcotte  Tiger Woods  It is difficult to target a golfer making his first competitive start with FedEx Cup points on the line since this event last year, but in this case, the golfer is Tiger Woods. There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
231	231	13	14	target: J Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five for Pebble Beach: C Smith 125/1, S Cink 150/1, M Thompson 175/1, J Hahn 200/1, G Owen 200/1. 365 have nice top20 prices for latter four
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
8978	8978	2	3	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 125/1 Paddy Power The competition is less fierce than a normal PGA Tour event and his ball-striking should out him in contention. He might excel in the early part of the season away from the spotlight.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
10742	10742	11	11	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His past five years here shook out in finishes of 5/11/4/64/6. Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure.
13257	13257	15	15	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have gamer's remorse, well, there you go. Just as he was last year, Donald is my pick. If you don't like it, ask yourself if you're stereotyping for whatever motivation.
4057	4057	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.

9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
6224	6224	41	41	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A good putting week and he'll be very dangerous on a course like this. I don't want to be backing anyone at short prices this week given the lack of course form so therefore I'm happy to take the 50/1 about Bradley rather than the short odds for Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. Bill Haas and Brendan Steele have good credentials but between them they have a win apiece since 2013 so I'm not overly enthused about either at 25/1.
12142	12142	33	34	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With little wind forecast for day one scoring is bound to be low , making a confident touch on Bermuda greens imperative." *EW Terms: 1/4 Odds | 5 Places  Steve Rawlings says: Back Bubba Watson @ 40/1  Bubba Watson is a mercurial character and there isn't a venue played that doesn't highlight his unpredictability better than Bay Hill. It was in this event in 2014 that he withdrew after shooting an 11-over-par 83 in the opening round, which included an 11 at the par five sixth hole!
335	335	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very minimal research but on top of DJ and Spieth I really like JT this week. Vegas And Haas for cheap. Woody Phil and Reed too.
4674	4674	2	3	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			GPP ONLY. Nick Taylor $6,900  Welp, there ya go. The top 17 (no idea how I keep landing on that number of picks every week) for this week if playing on DraftKings.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.

2178	2178	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world. Day doesn’t have the strongest history here (two MCs and a 64th), but the last time he played this event was way back in 2012 and given the layoff I wouldn’t put too much stock in his shaky course history. While he hasn’t shown dominant form yet in 2017, Day put in three great rounds at Pebble and this could easily be the week he puts the hammer down and distances himself from the field.
7817	7817	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He hasn’t had a signature win since The Players a few years ago, and I think this could be spot where he breaks through on the WGC stage. Jason Day (DK: $9,400, FD: $8,800)  This is purely a gut call and could blow up in my face, but I’ll be going heavy on Day in GPPs. I have to believe that his ownership will be microscopic and in an 76-man field, we’ll need to take some shots on low owned guys who can legitimately win the event.
6153	6153	28	29	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			14 in the Power Rankings), Harris English (Sleeper) and Chez Reavie (Draw in the Fantasy Insider). That you've come this far without a mention of two-time Travelers champion Bubba Watson says all that you need to know. Because of an inconsistent 2017 perhaps due to the change in his ball, he sets up as an ironic contrarian at the tournament where he's the all-time earnings leader, but only if you're way back in the pack.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
10967	10967	17	17	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still, he missed the cut. Coming into Riviera off a missed cut and in questionable form makes Scott a decent GPP play this week. Since we know most golfers will be playing from the rough this week, I peeked at guys who make birdies from the rough.
12784	12784	29	30	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think this week signifies his best chance of winning a Major and, if he doesn't, a top-8 finish is by no means out of the question. Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course.
797	797	5	6	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton Kizzire - $8,500  4. Webb Simpson - $7,800  5. Nick Watney - $7,500  6.
3028	3028	24	25	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
3633	3633	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price suckered me in. Paul Casey 40% – Speaking of way too cheap. Here we have Paul Casey.
12862	12862	30	31	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose rates out near the top of every single stat, has nine top 10s in his past 11 starts, and has gone P2/T10/T2/T14 the last four years at Augusta National. Adam Scott  The 2013 Masters champ took most of the first two months off from competitive play, and since his return at Pebble Beach, the results have been rather middling — MC/T53/T13/T16/T41. Guess why?
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
8505	8505	49	49	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To recover from a 77 with a closing 70 to finish T9 was a fair effort and that top 10 built on previous finishes of T24 (WGC-Bridgestone) and T27 (Open Championship) so he's clearly coming back to life after a dip. Talking at Quail Hollow after a second-round 66, Day explained: "There were signs coming from Royal Birkdale; there were signs coming from last week in Akron. Being able to piece it together is difficult, because the driving and the putting has been lagging behind.
204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
5639	5639	0	1	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8,800): Scott has been up and down ever since the Masters but his recent finish at the FedEx St. Jude suggests a man whose long game might be finally peaking. Scott was top five in SG: approaches and tee to green in Memphis and has actually been putting better than his career averages recently too. For DFS, he’s well under priced at just $8,800 and probably a better play from a pure value perspective than anyone in the 9k range.
8142	8142	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another guy to watch on Fanshare, but I can’t see him above 25% with all the names above him. Rickie Fowler $10,700 – He has a win at Quail in 2012 and a 4th in 2016. I think he figured something out last week after a bit of a letdown at The Open.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
12699	12699	1	1	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9300): Although he fell back in the pack on Sunday in his Masters debut last year, Rahm was very impressive through 54 holes at Augusta, sitting at even par through 54 in what was a very tough week for scoring. For a first-timer, Rahm flashed all the tools necessary to succeed in the years to come, and this year he should sport an even better finish. Since the start of 2018, the feisty Spaniard has amassed four top-25s – including a win at CareerBuilder and a runner-up in the Tournament of Champions – while missing zero cuts in seven events.
93	93	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sleeper of the Week  Our weekly pick for you is one that you may not expect. Graham DeLaet: He scored a top 5 here in 2012 and was 20th in the Olympics a few weeks ago. He also posted a top 10 in July, so he is close.
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
11901	11901	26	27	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			282 yards (48th), 60.7% fairways (51st), 72.2% greens in regulation (7th), 33'8" proximity to hole (11th), 60.0 % scrambling (34th), 1.65 putts per GIR (3rd). 2013, Tiger Woods (-13). 279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st).
6104	6104	65	66	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For tournaments, I will be looking to build around a core the same core for the most part but also using some contrarian plays that could be lower owned with similar upside.

9004	9004	11	12	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Purse: $7 million; $1.26 million (winner); 500 FEC points. Defending Champion: Justin Thomas defended his championship as he defeated Hideki Matsuyama by three shots. Notes: 78 players; 72 holes (no cut).
8090	8090	19	20	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My shortlist was massive this week although very few really struck me as potential winners. Of those that did, Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel were the most notable within our price range. Both have majors pedigree, excellent Florida records and are long off the tee.
1209	1209	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he'll have hit the reset button since placing 10th in Tiger's tournament and he's definitely worth following in this event. Hopefully, this is the best market for us to fully cash in and it's worth pointing out that with four payout places, Reed could finish eighth in the tournament and we'd still edge a profit on him. With the front of the betting so strong, it's hard to find much space for any bigger-priced players.
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
3652	3652	17	17	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have to take the chalk in this group (Kuchar/Snedeker/Furyk), Kuch is the best bet. Tyrrell Hatton & Jason Dufner – As with Grace last year, the missed cut for Hatton at Augusta may actually work in his favor. Expectations have been lowered and he got the extra two days of downtime.
578	578	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will. He’s long enough to suit this course and with 9 consecutive tournaments of being under par, Reed has the scoring ability to win everything come Sunday.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
11523	11523	17	18	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The second WGC of the 2017-18 season also presents career-changing potential for non-members. In last year's edition, Tommy Fleetwood, Ross Fisher, Thomas Pieters and Tyrrell Hatton recorded top 10s in Mexico City. Each would go on to total enough non-member FedExCup points to secure fully exempt status this season.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
1031	1031	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
11902	11902	25	26	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st). 2012, Tiger Woods (-13). 295 yards (11th), 64.3% fairways (29th), 79.2% greens in regulation (1st), 36'4" proximity to hole (20th), 60.0% scrambling (10th), 1.84 putts per GIR (52nd).
5218	5218	19	20	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
7254	7254	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
6500	6500	17	19	target: Tyrone Van Aswegen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			During his streak, he's up nearly six percentage points and slots a season-best T44 in the stat. Tyrone Van Aswegen … No golfer puts four rounds together regularly, but the absence of it entirely is the ironic constant among rank-and-filers. When expectations need to remain high to sustain a livelihood at this level, any spark can be monumental, not to mention lucrative.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
6119	6119	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(gpp)  Anirban Lahiri ($7,500) – Par 4 scoring machine when he’s on and he definitely has the ability to come out hot. (gpp)  Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Had a MC last week but I’m not worried. He fits this course and has been solid all season.
6579	6579	30	30	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The scrubs in these tournaments are trash, and the upside a top tiered golfer offers isn’t much higher than someone in the $9K range. That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls.
12168	12168	3	4	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fervor that Tiger Woods manufactured at last week's Valspar Championship was all the most skeptical needed to close the chapter on any residual doubt in his latest return to competition. His performance aligned with candor, honesty, adjusted expectations and the glint of his old and still familiar fire. It reminded us of all that once was good and that he could be again.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
1985	1985	15	15	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I hurt way too much last week. Price isn't the only thing to like about Reed as he has excellent course history with finishes of T22, T4, T7 and T21 last season. He ranks inside the Top 1o of West Coast Positive players and although the stats don't show it thus far, he is an amazing scrambler.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
6545	6545	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries. Cink is one of the best in the field in SG: Approach. He’ll be wildly popular we suspect in DraftKings GPPs, but it’s too great of a bargain to pass up.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2472	2472	18	18	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be in for some positive regression this week. When looking at our European Tour comp courses, Garcia fits. He’s especially fond of Crans Sur Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters.
8582	8582	42	43	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are firm and you have a lot of options for shots around the greens." Weather Forecast    TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting at 19:00 on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Patrick Reed -9  2015 - Jason Day -19  2014 - Hunter Mahan -14  2013 - Adam Scott -11  2012 - Nick Watney -10      What Will it Take to Win the Northern Trust? It's never easy when a new venue is used but it sounds like the fairways are generous enough so Driving Accuracy is probably a stat to ignore.
12647	12647	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the GOLF GODS exist, they’ll be worth a couple of shots this week. Brandt Snedeker: He’s never made the cut but his last trip was 2013. He was one shot out of the lead at Valspar before fading with 78.
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
12058	12058	32	32	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I especially like him in cash games because his $7,500 price tag gives you a solid cut-maker with upside and saves some salary-cap space for other high-end options. -- Jeff Bergerson  Emiliano Grillo  Although Grillo faded down the stretch at the Hero Indian Open and is flying across the world to play this week, he still offers excellent value at his price tag. He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season.
1206	1206	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And he also showed it when winning this tournament two years ago. Reed posted 21-under on that occasion before showing his one-to-one skills by defeating compatriot Jimmy Walker in a play-off. There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
7883	7883	11	11	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – WGC-Bridgestone Invitational  Lock of the week:  Rickie Fowler – $10,600 – Rickie’s in impeccable form as of late in tough fields, his SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his three T10’s at Firestone Country Club in the last five years make him a clear lock in any format. He’s a slight cost savings as well, just cracking the five digit mark at $10,600. We won’t care how popular Fowler will be this week as his golf has been consistent with 14/16 cuts made this season and three Top-10s in his past four starts.
13228	13228	14	15	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a decent week at Augusta and should do well here with his length. Luke Donald – It’s hard to look past Donald at Hilton Head, despite him never winning there. His record speaks for itself so he should contend.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
12285	12285	101	102	target: Harris English. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi; 9) Fabian Gomez; 10) Richy Werenski; 11) Brice Garnett / Graeme McDowell / Rory Sabbatini; 14) Tim Herron; 15) Ben Crane; 16) Scott Piercy; 17) Alex Cejka / Joel Dahmen / Tyler Duncan; 20) Davis Love III. Greens in Regulation : 1) Scott Piercy; 2) Sam Ryder; 3) Emiliano Grillo; 4) Corey Conners; 5) J.J. Henry; 6) Denny McCarthy / Rory Sabbatini; 8) Kevin Tway; 9) Andrew Putnam; 10) Nate Lashley; 11) Davis Love III; 12) Tyler Duncan / Xin-Jun Zhang; 14) Jonathan Byrd; 15) Brett Stegmaier; 16) Tim Herron / Adam Schenk; 18) Martin Flores / Keith Mitchell; 20) Harris English. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Ricky Barnes; 2) Emiliano Grillo; 3) Lanto Griffin; 4) Andres Romero; 5) Greg Chalmers / Michael Kim; 7) Scott Piercy; 8) David Lingmerth; 9) Troy Merritt; 10) Harris English / Trey Mullinax; 12) Jim Furyk / Tom Lovelady; 14) Fabian Gomez / Mike Weir; 16) Martin Flores / Ethan Tracy; 18) Robert Garrigus / Ricky Werenski; 20) Johnson Wagner.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
245	245	11	11	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
7688	7688	2	3	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
11875	11875	2	3	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
815	815	3	3	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5. Strokes Gained Approach to Green – Simpson, Garrigus, Cejka, Taylor, DeLeat  Player Focus: The Shriners  On the Rise: Pretty bad week overall.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
1589	1589	27	29	target: Charles Howell III: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer has always had an erratic streak that has kept him from ascending to the upper echelons, and this was yet another week that exemplifies that tendency. Charles Howell III: Another week, another top 15 finish from CH3. The transition to PXG and recovery from his injury late last season have clearly returned Chalk Howell back to his prominent, consistent form.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
13682	13682	24	24	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
11875	11875	2	2	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
1788	1788	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are a few names to consider at every different price level. High-Priced  Hideki Matsuyama ($11,700) – It’s not that I don’t like Spieth – it’s that I couldn’t justify putting anyone higher on this list than Matsuyama. He has been as hot as anyone in golf since last fall, consistently playing well enough to make cuts and at least getting into position to challenge for a top spot on the leaderboard week in and week out.
3253	3253	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la creme  Rickie Fowler: $10,000  Spieth and Stenson will be the most highly owned golfers this week, and not without good reason. Consider fading them for the cheaper Rickie Fowler, who has been on a tepid march lately with a win and a trio of top-20 finishes in his last four starts. He's never missed the cut in Houston and has a pair of top-10 finishes.
8724	8724	19	20	target: (Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens are smaller than average and sectioned into quadrants. Don't discount the fact that the last two winners here (Jason Day and Zach Johnson) are among the tour's best putters. In addition to the aforementioned dexterity with the flatstick, aptitude with the driver (distance preferred!)
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
3274	3274	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At less than $7,000, this is a no-brainer. Michael Kim - $6,400 (Field, 7-2)    Kim hit a rough patch of consecutive missed cuts at Riviera and the Honda, but he's cashed twice since, including a T17 in his last start at Bay Hill. That was his fifth top-25 already this season.
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
1309	1309	0	1	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama  Price: $11,000  I wrote last week that I was going to continue to roll with Matsuyama until he cools off, and that's not changing now. Dating back to last fall, here's how the scintillating-hot 24-year-old has fared in his last six events: win, second place to Justin Thomas, win, win, win, second place to Justin Thomas. At some point he's going to finish outside of the Top 2, and there's a good chance that happens at Waialae, where he has three missed cuts (all as an amateur) and a DNF (2015), but he's just playing too well to fade right now.

Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
7690	7690	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
2024	2024	38	39	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the top 5s won’t happen every week, Rose is coming off a T6 finish here last year, and oh by the way, he’s currently leading the PGA in strokes gained tee-to-green, scoring average, and pre-cut scoring average. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – That’s right, I’m hopping back in the Jimmy horse. He might’ve kicked me off twice already this season, but COME ON!
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2769	2769	19	20	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook. Graham DeLaet and Kevin Na. Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook.
5970	5970	9	9	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open. But what really spurs the Thomas pick is his experience at River Highlands, shooting a 62 last year to finish T-3.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
10436	10436	23	24	target: Harris English, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price. Harris English, $8500 – About halfway down the salary list we see English, and no, this is not a misinterpretation. But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
2623	2623	1	1	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
7537	7537	32	32	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
13055	13055	37	38	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another. I can definitely see Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson being part of the picture too so will back both for top 10s at [2.88] and [2.84] respectively. Both can play this course in their sleep and I want to cash in on their combination of experience and impressive recent form.
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
4126	4126	8	9	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
1061	1061	6	6	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some interesting prices out there. Stewgoat Cink at $6800 will prob bankrupt me
11363	11363	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
10129	10129	10	10	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So why not use the CareerBuilder as a tune-up? Beyond Rahm, Brian Harman, on the heel of his recent HOT FIYA run, is the only other member of the world’s top 20 in the CareerBuilder field. Failing to convert another 36-hole lead at the Sony Open, the 3-foot-7 Harman is one of 10 players teeing it up for the third consecutive week to begin the year.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
1478	1478	22	23	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$10million+ Salary Players :  Positive: We have 6 players over the $10 million threshold this week which is something new for 2017. Bill Haas takes some beating from a consistency level - he's Mr PGA West - and although the move to a tricky Pete Dye Stadium Course has not helped the Carolinian in any sense, you would be crazy to leave him out of your roster if you want a +$10m spear-head. Zach Johnson is the other that appeals to me on the basis he made 21 birdies and an eagle last week, in what was far and away his best PGA Tour outing since the 2015 Barclays tournament.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
7462	7462	13	13	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good min-price punt this week. Others: Robert Garrigus  High-upside GPP Picks  Bubba Watson ($9,400): Watson has picked up the pace a bit over his couple of starts and comes in off the back of three straight made cuts and a T27 at last weeks Open. It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well.
10743	10743	20	20	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure. (Note: It is worth following how Day says his back is feeling prior to Thursday.)
11766	11766	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style. Matt Kuchar – Cash – DK: $8200 FD: $10600  Although last weekend was rough for Matt Kuchar, I have full confidence to go back to him in cash game contests this week.
3325	3325	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a different golfer this year and just looks so confident out there. If you have followed us the past month you can probably tell that we have loved Rickie Fowler this year. And it has paid significant dividends.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
1350	1350	2	3	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Patrick Reed is a great bet at 60/1. Course History and extreme recent form being overvalued by the books.… https://t.co/TbrLwKNofc
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
2201	2201	20	20	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s close, and Riviera has been kind to him – top-4 finishes five times since T-10 in 2009. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
12824	12824	5	5	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All of this is valid. Thomas does have to prove he can contend at Augusta, whereas every other player right at the front of this market has done so once or more already. It's this which is keeping him from the front of the win-only market, because on a golf course which we could reasonably describe as a level playing field, he would certainly not be as big as 15.0; in fact he'd probably be favourite.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
7398	7398	2	2	target: Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
4230	4230	1	2	target: B. Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. B. Haas – Should be playing better than he is. Look for a top 5 here.
2032	2032	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
13568	13568	19	20	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As of midday Wednesday, he's way out front in ownership percentage at 20 percent. That's eight clicks better than Luke List in second and 14 points clear of both Sergio Garcia and Brendan Steele. Surely, there are options.
568	568	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
9148	9148	15	16	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’re comfortable enough with Nick in GPPs or cash game contests. Best bargain basement option:  Aaron Wise $6,900 – We love Wise this week in GPP contests as we anticipate his ownership around 5%. Wise trains at TPC Summerlin and calls it a home track.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
5562	5562	24	25	target: Charl Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After running the world's top 40 players through all those qualification criteria, only five players survive. They are: Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia, Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel and Kevin Chappell. Another stat:  Nine of the last 10 US Open winners were not the Masters champion  Sorry Sergio.
41	41	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#TheBarclays Long Shot Bets: Vegas 150/1, Stefani 250/1, Glover 150/1.
8851	8851	33	34	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Matt Kuchar being priced at $7,700 on Draftkings he will make a great cash-game play or just throw him in as a core player in your GPP lineups, you won't regret it. Paul Casey @ $8,600  I don't think that there's a whole lot that I need to say about Paul Casey. He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
3649	3649	53	53	target: Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It worries me slightly here with so much around-the-green work to be done, but if he continues to lap the field in SG: Approach and Putting, he’ll make enough birdies to counteract the hiccups. Oh, he’s the highest ranked player in the field too (16th), don’t forget that… I’m such a sucker for Dufner. He’s never been a great Pete Dye player, but his game theoretically translates perfectly.
11373	11373	35	35	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It was interesting listening to Phil Mickelson in interview last year here where he talked at length about the nuances of altitude golf and how it can favour 'feel golfers' such as himself and with Bubba cut from a similar cloth in that respect, I can see him enjoying this week after finishing 38th on debut 12 months ago when at a very low ebb. Classical courses carry no concerns for Watson who's twice mastered Augusta National - and who's to say he won't contend again this year - and those tracks featuring Kikuyu on the fairways and rough and Poa Annua on the greens are clearly no issue, as was once again demonstrated at the Genesis on his last start. Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view.
463	463	2	2	target: Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thoughts on Brehm at $5900 on DK? 9th in DD / 33rd in BirdieAvg on @WebDotComTour last year. Slow greens neutralize poor putting... #DFS
465	465	41	42	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
3861	3861	10	11	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantastic player to throw in your Cash or GPP lineups. Kyle Stanley $7,200 – Stanley is coming off a T8 at the Shell, T17 at Bay Hill, and T27 at Valspar. He leads the PGA Tour in the Ball-Striking statistic which is the most heavily weighted stat this week at Harbour Town.
1656	1656	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He did miss the cut in 2014, as he battled his way through injuries, and finished T19 in 2015. The MC was a hiccup, with issues physically, much like Day when he’s gone in at full health, he’s dominated the event. He comes in at 33rd this week, as his Par 5 performance last season wasn’t as good as we’ve seen.
13267	13267	24	25	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Editor’s Note: Adam Hadwin has withdrawn from this week’s RBC Heritage Open. Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Marc Leishman, Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Kuchar, Brian Harman, Kevin Kisner, Charley Hoffman, Xander Schauffele, Francesco Molinari, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ian Poulter, Cameron Smith, Webb Simpson, Adam Hadwin, Si-WOOOO Kim, Satoshi Kodaira, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Martin Kaymer, Vijay Singh and Bryson Dechambeau are all in the 2018 Heritage field, and each one played the weekend in Augusta. Patrick Cantlay, Jason Dufner, Kevin Chappell, Ross Fisher, Dylan Frittelli, Charl Schwartzel, Ted Potter Jr., Billy Horschel, Doc Redman, Austin Cook and defending champion Wes Bryan all had aspirations of donning the Green Jacket, but that dream ended on Friday for them.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
2026	2026	48	48	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But seriously, he hasn’t missed three cuts in a row since 2013, his play earlier in this season has still been solid, and his history in this tournament is just as sensational as the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open. So while others hopefully zag away from Walker, I will keep zigging and just address the elephant in the room later if he burns me again. Middle of the Road  Phil Mickelson $9,300 – Here’s a fun thing: apparently mild hernias are not that hard to recover from.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
8939	8939	38	39	target: Gary Woodland. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's joined by the Tour Championship winner Xander Schauffele and runner-up here 12 months ago Hideki Matsuyama. This week's field also includes Tour Championship qualifiers Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Adam Hadwin, Pat Perez, Kyle Stanley, Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland. Throw-in talented players of the ilk of course winner Anirban Lahiri, Branden Grace, Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel and Thomas Pieters.
12398	12398	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're chasing and have no qualms about sending anyone out, zone in on the last four champions – Day (2014, 2016), McIlroy (2015) and Dustin Johnson (2017). Day and DJ could square off in the quarterfinals, but you already knew that. Bring it on.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
9538	9538	45	46	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
2575	2575	22	22	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
8440	8440	47	48	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some stats below from the opening round of the Playoffs over the past few years:  P ath to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Patrick Reed: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 2nd. 2015 - Jason Day: Round 1: 18th, Round 2: 8th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Hunter Mahan: Round 1: 2nd, Round 2: 12th, Round 3: 3rd.
13060	13060	36	37	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we are focusing on the 8K and up range this week, all of these guys have a legitimate chance of winning this tournament, but like I said earlier, you have to make a stand somewhere. Phil Mickelson: DK $9500/FD $11200  All you really need to do is look at the picture at the top of this page. Phil is wearing a collared, button up shirt, with his jumpman logo on the cuffs, in a practice round.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
1945	1945	9	10	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel: Brandt Snedeker ($10,000)  The winner of this event in 2013 and '15, he's looking to keep that odd-year streak going this week. Sneds isn't just a horse for these courses; he's also playing well right now, as evidenced by a title contention at Torrey Pines two weeks ago.
2320	2320	40	41	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t expect much different this week either. Beyond Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas, all the top ranked players in the field are internationals: Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Branden Grace, Russell Knox, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Francesco Molinari, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald and Thomas Pieters. We even get a quartet of Brits making the trek to America for the first time this year: Danny Willet, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ty Hatton and Ian Poulter.
2471	2471	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking. Garcia was excellent off-the-tee last week, but struggled mightily on the greens. He should be in for some positive regression this week.
12175	12175	13	13	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he's converting on the greens, he has us at, "Cheers!" If both Woods and Rose are available to you, they might as well just line up as your picks for the API and the Masters in whichever quinella you prefer. We're treated to the steady contributions of Tommy Fleetwood and Alex Noren again this week, but they'll be there again for us at next week's Match Play where no one will want to square off against either.
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12033	12033	28	29	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
1022	1022	25	26	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
119	119	46	47	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tournament Skill Averages :  Driving Distance: 32nd, Driving Accuracy: 22nd, Greens in Regulation: 12th, Proximity to Hole: 20th, Scrambling: 30th, Putting Average 27th. So let's take a view from players as to how Bethpage Black played at the 2012 Barclays and what specific skills it requires:  Bubba Watson : "I think it'll be a tough test. Again, that's the only time I've played it, so I don't know if they can firm up the greens.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
12789	12789	33	34	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five of the world's top 10 have already won in 2018, with Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy picking up victories as recently as the Florida Swing. Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
9474	9474	36	36	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s even with his untimely stair-fall Augusta back injury that limited him quite badly as he wasn’t quite the same golfer until, of course, he shipped the Northern Trust in August. I can imagine that if Rahm looks at stat ranks, DJ is without question the stormy cloud that reminds him that he’s just not quite there yet. DJ gained an average of 1.002 OTT and .702 APR last year and, like Rahm, with only .104 gained ARG, he posted an absolutely disgusting 1.809 SG:T2G average per round.
1947	1947	29	29	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am going with a guy who seems motivated again, was in the mix two weeks ago in San Diego, and loves Pebble Beach, having won here before. When Snedeker won this event in 2015, he had kind of fallen off and was becoming a forgotten player. He was not qualified for the Masters, which we all know is his favorite tournament.
1760	1760	46	46	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
565	565	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed Kaymer at 185/1. Poor record here, but playing well and likes the big event. Weather could produce a surprise winner like ZJ in 2007.
8940	8940	43	44	target: Gary Woodland; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) Jim Herman; 13) Paul Casey; 14) Graeme DeLaet / Richy Werenski; 16) Hao Tong Li / Brendan Steele; 18) Jason Dufner / Lucas Glover; 20) Rafael Cabrera-Bello. Greens in Regulation : 1) Paul Casey / Brendan Steele; 3) Graham DeLaet / Gary Woodland; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Stewart Cink; 7) Pat Perez / Harold Varner III; 9) Justin Thomas; 10) Bud Cauley; 11) Jason Dufner / Hudson Swafford; 13) Keegan Bradley / Luke List; 15) Hao Tong Li / Kyle Stanley; 17) Emiliano Grillo; 18) Scott Hend; 19) Martin Flores; 20) Grayson Murray.

12100	12100	41	41	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large. Arnold Palmer Invitational Interactive Data  Note these tools are FREE each week for Pro Members.
8872	8872	17	18	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should I add anyone else once the market matures I'll update Twitter before the off. Recommended Bet  Chesson Hadley @ 60/1 (Sportsbook)    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
2756	2756	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
11427	11427	28	28	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s due for a breakout on the North American stage, and perhaps a trip to Mexico is all he needs to get the monkey off his back. Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil.
4850	4850	32	33	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			'Rahmbo' for me is a future World Number 1 who in all likelihood can win on any course, however 12/1 on a specialised track where experience pays like Colonial holds little appeal. Jason Dufner will be well-backed this week and is the first up for me. Tough, windy conditions will play to his strengths, as will fast conditions if they come into play.
842	842	10	10	target: KOEPKA 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
5941	5941	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect a thrilling finish and bounce backs from McIlroy and Day, who both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Russell Knox  2015 – Bubba Watson  2014 – Kevin Streelman  2013 – Ken Duke  2012 – Marc Leishman  2011 – Fredrik Jacobsen  2010 – Bubba Watson  2009 – Kenny Perry  2008 – Stewart Cink  2007 – Hunter Mahan    Key Stats to Winning at TPC River Highlands    • Par Breakers percentage  • Par 4 scoring average  • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green    Champion's Profile    With an interesting list of both short and long hitters claiming victories in the past, it is clear length has little to do with winning on one of the PGA Tour’s shortest courses. Plenty of shorter holes means birdies can come in bunches and are essential to success here, so look for players with high par-breaker percentages as quality candidates.

Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.

Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
2117	2117	20	20	target: Laird’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
4863	4863	47	48	target: Jason Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Amazingly Jon Rahm heads the betting, which is a measure of his meteoric rise along with the lack of strength in depth in the field. The Spaniard is a class act but I think the title might be heading to another elite ball-striker in the shape of Jason Dufner. Twice a runner-up at Colonial he finished T6 last year and it’s clearly a course he gets on well with.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
5747	5747	3	3	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts. With his mother’s health improved and his own health no longer an issue, Day seems to be playing much freer of late and for that reason alone I’d not be shocked at all if he put it all together here and won his second major.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
5881	5881	22	23	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finishing position in brackets:  2016: Russell Knox -10 (Winner); Jerry Kelly (2nd) Shawn Stefani (11th) -9; Tyrone Van Aswegen (5th) -8. 2015: Bubba Watson -12 (Winner); Bo Van Pelt (7th) -10; Paul Casey (2nd) -9; Curran (10th), Delaet (4th), Gore (10th), Harman (3rd), Pettersson (5th) -8. 2014: Kevin Streelman (Winner), Brandt Snedeker (11th) -11; K.J.
8139	8139	22	23	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can see him being highly owned, but he is cash worthy no matter how highly touted he is, in my opinion. Gary Woodland $6,700 – Played awful Thursday and Friday of last week, but bounced back decently well on the weekend with a 69 on Sunday. He hits it long enough and should have less ownership than he would’ve with a good showing last week.
5837	5837	8	9	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s break down the field! The Favorites…  Rickie Fowler – Player with the most balanced bag in the field goes right back to the top after missing the cut in Memphis. Fowler checks in #2 SG: Total highlighted by his excellent putting and short game.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
1628	1628	30	30	target: Snedeker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one shot adrift when play resumed on the Monday, but winds from the opposite direction meant Jimmy Walker, Kevin Streelman and most notably KJ Choi failed to better Snedeker. Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year.
12071	12071	1	2	target: Bradley/Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth. They’re generating beaucoup birdie tries, and that’s what you want at Bay Hill.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.

5319	5319	11	12	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The less our players have to scramble the better. Core Plays  Rickie Fowler ($12,000) – Never thought I would see the day that I pay $12,000 for Rickie Fowler. That is the kind of year this guy is having though.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
10785	10785	73	74	target: Shane Lowry. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The organisers tend to shape the draw so that the top players play consecutive rounds around Pebble on the weekend and if they do so again and Saturday ends up being really blustery, the current market leaders could get the worst of the draw. Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast.
1652	1652	21	21	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA DFS T10 Model 1. Fleets 2. Hatton 3. JT 4. Noren 5. Rory 6. CH3 7. Sergio 8. Woodland 9. Hadley 10. Kaymer
11205	11205	30	30	target: Garcia's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago. The week before, he won the Singapore Open.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
309	309	27	27	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
5966	5966	25	26	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But enough rambling; here's what the Professor has to say for the 2017 Travelers Championship. Pinterest Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth Jason Day Rory McIlroy Brandt Snedeker Justin Thomas Tony Finau Patrick Reed Webb Simpson Paul Casey Kevin Na  Professor's Explanation : The top three picks come out strong (in the event) almost every time.

1637	1637	45	46	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 5 winners  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top ten performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016). The other three either hadn’t played for at least 3 weeks or finished outside the top 50 the week prior.
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
7324	7324	18	19	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens. The only score close is Mark O'Meara's even-par in 1998, also weather-induced.
236	236	19	19	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He loves the challenge of a difficult golf course and I could easily see him taking home this title. Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 33/1  Draftkings - $9,100  FantasyAces - $5,650  Bubba checks every box for me this week. He is coming off an 8th place finish at the Olympics and if there was anyone who seemed to embrace the experience 100% it was definitely Bubba.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
853	853	16	16	target: Rory/Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just getting around to listen. Looks like @NYCPunter and I are both gonna be riding the Rory/Hideki train... https://t.co/drnZAVEJBz

3596	3596	31	31	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years. He will look to dominate the competition with his strong iron play.
168	168	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To steal a line from Samuel L. Jackson in the first Jurassic Park, "Hold on to your butts." Jonathan Coachman -- Jason Day ($12,400)  Bethpage Black is a "big boys" golf course. There are a lot of holes that have long carries and long approach shots.
7624	7624	54	55	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This isn’t incredibly groundbreaking information, but you’ll want to roster golfers who can take advantage of the short Par 5s and who are in good recent form in terms of accuracy. The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively.
3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
11154	11154	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton 25/1  The Englishman has been in super form recently and hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in his last six starts. Since winning the Alfred Dunhill Links and Italian Open back to back in October, Hatton followed that with an impressive T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China. He then travelled to Turkey finishing T16 at the Turkish Airlines Open followed by a T19 at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa.
3599	3599	28	29	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
2433	2433	11	12	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 on Tour in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season truly dangerous. Sergio Garcia ($10,900) – What’s not to like about this choice? He’s been playing well recently (a win in Dubai three weeks ago featured four rounds in the 60s).
6178	6178	34	35	target: Rory McIlroy: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ultimately, we're looking at another second-shot golf course this week with greens in regulation percentage, proximity to the hole, and iron play from 150 to 200 yards key this week. Creme de la Creme  Rory McIlroy: $11,600  If Rory McIlroy doesn't barnstorm his way around this course and make one million birdies, he's not Rory McIlroy. Seriously.

12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
5615	5615	3	3	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But not before Johnson raises another U.S. Open trophy and lets the noise wash all the way over him. There are no trees on this property so that unforgettable noise will rise into the ether and disappear forever. And remember that harmonious barrel fire off of Johnson's clubs as he bends and unfurls his spindly frame into shot after shot at Erin Hills and winds his way around the old farmland.
8997	8997	3	3	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic. Thomas Pieters – GPP – DK: $8600 FD: $8000  One of my favourite plays when there is a no-cut event.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
3952	3952	13	14	target: Greg Owen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given how high the ownership will be on both Finau and Steele, using Greg Owen in a stars & scrubs format will help ease the ownership burden, with lots of upside to score well on DraftKings. Owen made the cut last year and finished T65, and in 2010 finished T41. His current form isn’t the prettiest, but if he can get a putt to drop he’ll be in great shape.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
459	459	30	31	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
1423	1423	19	19	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take one of the best putters in the world at +2300 here. Not many guys are talking about Dufner this week. I’m plugging him into the majority of my Draft Kings teams as well as buying him at +5000 to win the Sony.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
8880	8880	0	1	target: Brice Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20. His up and down play makes him an unnecessary risk in cash formats but I like his high ceiling for GPP formats.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
5887	5887	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			275 yards (46th), 85.7% fairways (9th), 72.2% greens in regulation (34th), proximity to hole 32'0" (45th), 95.0% scrambling (1st), 1.67 putts per GIR (11th). 2010, Bubba Watson (-14). 321 yards (1st), 66.1% fairways (58th), 70.8% greens in regulation (38th), proximity to hole 31'5" (25th), 57.1% scrambling (43rd), 1.63 putts per GIR (2nd).
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
8198	8198	57	58	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Quail Hollow Club, Charlotte, North Carolina  7,600 yards, Par 71  The Course  Quail Hollow is the host course of the Wells Fargo Championship since 2003 and is a tough test measuring a lengthy 7,600 yards. Previous winners here include Brian Harman (2017), James Hahn (2016), Rory McIlroy (2015 and 2010) J.B. Holmes (2014), Derek Ernst (2013), Rickie Fowler (2012) and Lucas Glover (2011). The course was originally designed by golf course architect George Cobb in 1961 to capture the beauty as well as challenging terrain of the Piedmont region.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
86	86	15	16	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rostering one of my least favorite DFS players this week, based on a gut feeling: Chris Kirk.
10595	10595	7	7	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Catch him while he’s on the rise. Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
6550	6550	21	22	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We aren’t playing a lot of cash games this week due to the field strength, but we love Keegan in GPPs. Gary Woodland $7,500 – Woodland hasn’t sniffed a top ten since we were wearing sweaters in Georgia, but he’s a consistent cut maker with the upside to win potentially. He’s a bomber that can take advantage of these forgiving fairways.
486	486	34	35	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston. Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week.
13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.
1024	1024	7	8	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			• • •  Mike Glasscott  Projected champion: Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world.
11849	11849	19	19	target: Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That same person isn’t going to magically lead in Driving Distance if they’re not a bomber. And what does Streelman do well? He’s incredibly efficient getting to the green.
3521	3521	19	20	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Slight preference is for Leishman as the Aussie has a T4 here from 2013 while Hadwin is a first-timer. Bill Haas is another at a big-looking 100/1 while, at 110s, I've always felt Ryan Moore has a big Masters in him at some point. At opposite ends of the age scale, it wouldn't surprise me at all if three-time winner Phil Mickelson and Spanish sensation Jon Rahm are part of a Sunday showdown.
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
7689	7689	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
13161	13161	19	19	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yep, we're definitely in KK country this week and I fully expect to see him up there. Last year, Kisner said: "I just feel like it's a great shot-maker's course. You can be in the fairway and have to carve shots into the pin.
2117	2117	20	20	target: Laird’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
6050	6050	29	29	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
10396	10396	22	22	target: Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cherry Hills: Winner: Billy Horschel; EW Places: Watson, Hoffmann, Fowler, Palmer. TPC Summerlin: Winner: Ben Martin; EW Places: Streelman, Knox, Simpson, Finau, Piercy. 2015 :  Old White: Winner: Danny Lee; EW Places: Streb, Henley, Hahn.
10206	10206	63	63	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event. Even so, an $8,900 salary on FanDuel this week has a significant amount of value in it if Woods makes the cut and shows very capable top-25 upside. He won the event in 2013, but Woods is clearly a different golfer now in 2018.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
12984	12984	41	41	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Noren ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 48th in GIR, 16th in SGTTG, 17th in strokes gained putting, 26th in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. After a missed cut on his only appearance here last year, Noren arrives in much better form this time around. Kiradech Aphibarnrat 100/1  The in form Thai looks great value here this week given his current run of form.
6553	6553	19	19	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			English has recovered from his midseason missed cut stretch with 4/5 straight made cuts. Looking at his Vegas odds English stands out in his price range and I think he does without a crazy high level of ownership. Much like Finau the weakest part of his game is minimized at this course.
9711	9711	24	24	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee. This play is all ownership dependent, currently, we are projecting Thomas at around 14% in GPP’s but that could all change throughout the week before we do a final update for VIP members. Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event.
1043	1043	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
9709	9709	5	5	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Army Pricing  Picks  Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $11600 FD: $12600  The disappointment of last week for the top end looks to be a great GPP this week as he should see suppressed ownership. Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
1303	1303	9	10	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fabian Gomez: 6th ToC/44th RSM/1st Personal Classic/MC Argentine Open. Jimmy Walker: 2nd ToC/9th Shark Shoot/15th World Challenge/35th HSBC. Jimmy Walker: 21st ToC/44th HSBC/6th CIMB/12th Shriners/1st Fry's.com.
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can’t look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
6050	6050	49	49	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
1261	1261	12	12	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			LETS DO THIS!!!!! NORTH COURSE STACK!!!!! Spaun +8000 Cink +10000 Chesson +10000 Wise +12500 Mullinax +15000 Post… https://t.co/3EHQym9alE
7537	7537	32	32	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
1445	1445	4	4	target: @BrandtSnedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First #ATTProAm bet is @BrandtSnedeker at 49/1. Snedeker absolutely loves Pebble Beach and has two wins here since… https://t.co/vL4CebF7GI
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.

Yahoo!
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
309	309	27	28	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
12883	12883	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
12469	12469	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course does grade out as a pretty strong fit so maybe, just maybe, he can break out of his massive slump. The Specialists  Retief Goosen  Emiliano Grillo  The specialist this week is Retief Goosen. The South African has flashed some form early in the year but no real consistency.
5822	5822	27	27	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That win was at Royal Aberdeen which I alluded to earlier. Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week.
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
1278	1278	50	51	target: Jimmy Walker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you don’t roster these guys unless you are playing in the Junkies Season Long Golf League, then by all means feel free to take that goose egg. Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know.
4589	4589	9	10	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Past Five Champions    2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Rickie Fowler  2014 – Martin Kaymer  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Matt Kuchar    Last Year’s Top 10 Finishers      1 Jason Day -15  2 Kevin Chappell -11  T3 Justin Thomas -10  T3 Matt Kuchar -10  T3 Colt Knost -10  T3 Ken Duke -10  T7 Francesco Molinari -9  T7 Hideki Matsuyama -9  T9 Graeme McDowell -8  T9 Daniel Berger -8  T9 Alex Cejka -8  The Names  Hey, Remember Me?

His rankings in SG:T2G (fourth) and scrambling (second) this season on Tour are elite, and it doesn’t hurt that he won this event in the past.Jason Day – $16,900Hideki Matsuyama – $16,900Justin Thomas – $16,500Henrik Stenson – $16,200The Pick: Everyone in this group could conceivably be listed in “The Names” category, as they all have notable victories and elite potential.
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
4162	4162	53	54	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Similarly, Brendan Steele and Keegan Bradley are two pals with course form, they too have combined to win the FT Shootout, and their putting issues aren’t too much of a worry here. Clearly, there are options galore at bigger prices but I’ll return towards the top of the market where Justin Thomas and Bud Cauley get the vote at 22/1. Cauley frustrated his backers – of whom few are more loyal than me – with a stop-start T10 last week, but that’s back-to-back top-10 finishes from a seriously-talented player whose career is firmly back on track.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
13683	13683	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
13188	13188	22	23	target: Brian Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
4303	4303	21	22	target: Bud Cauley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With those injury doubts, I'm willing to let him go there. The other player with a hat-trick of top 10s is Bud Cauley. Okay, they're of a different variety and one was even in a pairs event last week when he finished T5 alongside Justin Thomas in New Orleans.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
10660	10660	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form, course form and motivation could be converging nicely. RESULT: T35  Matt Kuchar 1.25pts EW 40/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places EW, 1/5):  I also like Matt Kuchar this week on a course where he's finished 6th across both the National Pro-Am and the 2010 U.S. Open. Yes he doesn't win enough, but a 40/1 shot this week has a little juice within it and as Gary Woodland proved last week, short-term momentum can sometimes get these kind of players over the line.
747	747	10	10	target: Rose/Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chasing another achievable double this week with Frittelli (45/1) into Rose/Stenson (7/1). Those prices won't last
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
1021	1021	24	25	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After tying for 66th in his Sea Island debut, has missed the cut in four consecutive starts. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
13299	13299	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he is priced as the 11th– most expensive player on DK, DailyRoto gives Hatton the fourth-best win probability (2.66%). Putting and short game are going to be a huge factor this week and Hatton is fifth in SG Putting and fourth in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green. This is a steal at just $8,800.

1123	1123	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler- 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(60th and 51st in his last two starts) However, he’s placed well both times here in the Bahamas so I expect that to continue. Rickie Fowler- $7,900 Returning to the form reminiscent of what we saw two seasons ago, Fowler’s game is headed in the right direction. Two good showings both times here in the Bahamas and at $7900 I like a top 5 in his future.
778	778	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
2601	2601	2	2	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
2599	2599	15	15	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like Mickelson, he's a lot of golfer for $7,500. And averaging 3.75 birdies per round, Kaymer can fill it up. Definitely the biggest upside of anyone in the $7,400-$7,500 range.
5686	5686	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Dufner 2 weeks ago and Bello last week recency bias is real and he could be that guy this week after his missed cut at the St. Jude, which I’m not worried about at all. Middle Range  Paul Casey $8,400 – He currently sits as the second highest rated golfer in my model. Knock on wood he hasn’t missed a cut since I mushed him with my One and Done pick in Hawaii.
10569	10569	14	15	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he’s playing well again and was T-12 at Farmers last week. Also like: Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
7246	7246	22	23	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I prefer him at 25/1 than out-of-form Rory McIlroy and inexperienced Jon Rahm at 18s. Justin Rose and massively in-form local hero Tommy Fleetwood both have obvious links to Royal Birkdale and should go well at 25/1 and 18s respectively. A bit further down, I like Adam Scott and Branden Grace too.
7087	7087	54	55	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps it’s a big the reason why Royal Birkdale has produced so many classy winners. By country it reads five Americans - Arnold Palmer (1961), Lee Trevino (1971), Johnny Miller (1976), Tom Watson (1983) and Mark O'Meara (1998), three Australians - Peter Thomson (1954 & 1965) and Ian Baker-Finch (1991) and one Irishman - Padraig Harrington (2008). Every winner since the world rankings became a thing was a top 25 player; every winner before they existed would probably have been in the top 10.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6207	6207	56	75	target: David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Boo Weekley; 3) Ben Crane; 3) Spencer Levin; 4) Tim Wilkinson; 5) Kyle Stanley; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Jim Herman / Daniel Summerhays; 9) David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Johnson Wagner; 18) Martin Laird / Kyle Reifers; 20) K.J. Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor.
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
3729	3729	1	1	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Kisner was second to Furyk here, he put on a ball-striking clinic and a similar display should see him go close once more, his focus no doubt fixed on atoning for Bay Hill and winning on what's home soil for the South Carolina man, who practices nearby at Kiawah Island. As for going win-only, again that's largely so he can share the load with Snedeker, but I'm a big believer in Kisner's ability to get it done. He just looks a winner and even last week at the Masters said, "I'm not out here to make cuts.
13249	13249	29	29	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson is one of the most talented souls on tour; just not sure that translates to dividends this week. We do like Riccio's picks of Paul Casey and Zach Johnson, two players whose games mirror past RBC Heritage winners like Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, and Graeme McDowell. Same goes for his picks of Austin Cook (although the Model seemingly chooses Cook every week) and Matt Kuchar (who's won here in the past).
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
2908	2908	14	15	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Jason Day; 2) Hideki Matsuyama; 3) James Hahn; 4) Tommy Fleetwood; 5) Tiger Woods; 6) Cameron Smith; 7) Emiliano Grillo / Patton Kizzire / Alex Noren; 10) Chesson Hadley; 11) Marc Leishman; 12) Charl Schwartzel; 13) Brian Harman / Si Woo Kim; 15) Austin Cook / Justin Rose / Sam Saunders; 18) Tyrrell Hatton; 19) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Zach Johnson / Ollie Schniederjans / Chris Stroud.

11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
314	314	37	37	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Field: Top 100 in FedExCup Standings  TPC Boston, Norton, MA  Par 71, 7,216 yards  The Course  This week the FedExCup Playoffs travel to TPC Boston where it has hosted this The Deutsche Bank since 2003. Its Labour Day weekend in The US so this tournament will go from Friday-Monday. It is a par 71 layout with three par 5’s, four par 3’s and 11 par 4’s and has a tendency to give up very low scores.
246	246	19	20	target: Matt Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
449	449	1	1	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Day loves this course and it really shows in his results as he’s landed finishes of 2nd, 3rd, 11th, 7th and 12th here in his last 6 visits. Day has been a birdie or better machine at this course over his career and is a great course horse this week. Sean O’Hair is an interesting addition to this list coming off his great week at the Barclays.
4498	4498	23	23	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
4131	4131	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Everyone suffered from his missed cut last week. Now, Cink is merely an afterthought heading into the Valero Texas Open. Cink is still having a phenomenal season for his standards, consistently finishing inside the top 30 and making 11 of his last 13 cuts.
1231	1231	3	4	target: Michael Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open: Michael Kim 350/1
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
1600	1600	14	14	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm hoping Stallings' form lasts another week as I'm e/w on him, Henley &amp; Murray (long shot) at the Honda Classic. #golf #bettingtips
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
45	45	12	13	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.
1521	1521	1	1	target: @ollie_gt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @ollie_gt is worth a bet at 54/1 in the #GenesisOpen. Schniederjans took to Riviera on his first start at the… https://t.co/9KvYiUELGc
5360	5360	37	37	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
5786	5786	12	162	target: Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win: Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300 And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada: Golfer April 17, 2017 (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017 (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
10377	10377	17	17	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kizzire is also the only player to have played 29 rounds or more and rank higher than Spaun in Par 4 Scoring Average, so this test looks to be right up Spaun’s alley this week. His T4 finish here 12 months ago was one of four top-10’s Spaun posted in 2017, with two of them coming at the start of this wrap-around season. He has finished inside the top-23 in 50% of his starts this season, with just two missed cuts, so a pretty successful start to the season overall.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
6606	6606	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can be tilting to follow live so I don’t recommend watching every shot. However, at this price Finau can allow you to avoid having to punt in cash games. Danny Lee ($16,400) – A former winner at this event, Danny Lee is riding a hot streak.
9969	9969	2	2	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Jon Rahm – All Formats – DK: $11800 FD: $12500  It seems almost unfair to write about picking the top player in the field but there is no way I can shy away from Rahm this week. Despite being the clear favourite of the field Jon Rahm’s price is not overly inflated and he is only a few hundred more than the second price players (Harman and Phil(why?)) on DraftKings and FanDuel respectively.
10986	10986	13	14	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be decently low owned with all the names in this range. Bubba Watson $7,800 – Pretty good price for a guy who has won here twice. He is getting some form back, so I will try and hop on before he is super chalk.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
2188	2188	28	29	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
2601	2601	1	2	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
11363	11363	6	7	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
3673	3673	0	1	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Luke Donald ($7,800) – Donald’s certainly not a guy we rely on week to week, but at certain spots, he’s just ridiculous – this one of them. Since 2009, Donald has carded four (4) runner-up finishes along with two third-place finishes. It’s not hard to understand why with his particular skill set, but no matter how little you’d normally trust him, this is the spot to set that aside.
383	383	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jason Day  Vegas Odds - 8/1  Draftkings - $12,500  FantasyAces - $6,200  What stood out to me more than anything last week was how awful Jason Day was off the tee(35% Driv Acc and ranked 72nd in SG:OTT) yet he was still able to finish T4 shooting a seven under par. Despite having to hit out of the rough for the majority of the four days he still had close to a 70% GIR(ranked T19) and led the field in SG:Putting.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
9710	9710	17	17	target: Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
1842	1842	69	70	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Standard eligibility rankings apply, whilst the following shall first be eligible:  AT&T Pebble Beach winners prior to 2000 and in the last five seasons The Players Championship and major championship winners prior to 2000 and in the last five years  In addition there is no Open Monday Qualifying for this event. Headlining the field is World No.1, Jason Day who is also joined by Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed from the world’s top-10. Day and Johnson will be looking for much better performances than they managed at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, as both players missed the cut in an event they were rightly favourites for.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
10405	10405	22	22	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 :  Old White: Winner: Xander Schauffele; EW Places: Streb, Lovemark, Henley, Kraft, Finau, Blaum. Chapultepec: Winner: Dustin Johnson; EW Places: Rahm, Thomas, Mickelson, Snedeker. Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
51	51	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lipsky &amp; Canizares in Switzerland and Reed and Woodland in the US for me this week. #golf #betting #tips
7091	7091	30	31	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut in the Irish Open last time but, against that negative, he posted a top 10 in France two starts ago and was T18 at Augusta National. Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
11165	11165	14	15	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why scrambling is so important this week. last year, Rickie Fowler and co-runners-up Gary Woodland and Morgan Hoffmann all finished top-10 in scrambling. The year before, the top-8 finishers were all top-12 in scrambling.
1290	1290	18	19	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Focus aggressively on tee-to-green excellence and you will most likely be rewarded in kind. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.
10971	10971	16	17	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
1074	1074	16	17	target: Ryan Armour… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Interesting stat from Kapalua: Dustin Johnson had 39 opportunities for birdie or better inside 20 feet. Ryan Armour… https://t.co/GmdWS6oPSM
577	577	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will.

9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.

12874	12874	59	59	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The prudent move will be to take him out of your lineups completely, however some people enjoy a higher degree of risk and will hope that his ankle is fine.

890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
11191	11191	27	28	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key stats follow in importance. • Driving accuracy  • Greens in regulation/strokes gained approach  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Bogey avoidance      Past Champions    2017 – Rickie Fowler  2016 - Adam Scott  2015 – Padraig Harrington  2014 – Russell Henley  2013 – Michael Thompson  2012 – Rory McIlroy  2011 – Rory Sabbatini  2010 – Camilo Villegas  2009 – Y.E. Yang  2008 – Ernie Els    Champion's Profile    Looking at last year's leaderboard, most guys in the top-10 had at least one double-bogey or even a triple-bogey.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!

And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
3829	3829	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Brit returns to action at arguably his best course. Donald has never won at Harbour Town, but he has four runner-ups and two thirds. Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well.

2603	2603	27	27	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
12704	12704	54	55	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is also live coverage on BBC2 on Saturday and Sunday, and they also have Red Button coverage from mid-afternoon over the weekend, showing featured groups, Amen Corner, and holes 15 and 16.

Sergio Garcia's stats were incredible last year and it's hardly surprising he won.
13188	13188	23	23	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out.
10717	10717	22	22	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why top-25s are good -- he's got four of them here in the past five years, two of them being top-10s. Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home.

3320	3320	14	14	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you really are looking for some marginal ownership spots you can expect Henrik Stenson to be lower owned than he should be as a result of his rocky play recently and WD mid round a month or so ago. With 5/5 made cuts at this event, two runner ups, and a third place finish here I plan on exploiting Stenson’s downward trend in ownership. Click To Enlarge!
9710	9710	17	17	target: Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
5820	5820	6	6	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong. But the clincher with Rose this week is how he has played on courses similar to Erin Hills. Rose was 4th at Whistling Straits, 12th at Pinehurst No.2 but the most interesting one is his Scottish Open win.
6525	6525	11	12	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kokrak could be dangerous if he gets the flat stick rolling. Stewart Cink - $14,100    The 44-year-old veteran just continues to be under-priced, despite climbing to 53rd in the FedExCup standings with 13 top-30s in 20 events this season. Over his past 12 rounds, he’s 12th among the field in SG: T2G, 11th in SG: Approach and 14th in SG: Putting.
89	89	25	26	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our Golfweek experts are here to help, providing their picks to win, sleeper players, DraftKings bargains and more. • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Bill Haas. He’s got a nice record at the Wyndham, with finishes of T-7 or better in three of his last four years (other finish was a T-20).
4730	4730	30	30	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament. Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him.
320	320	2	2	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @Thomas_Pieters at 80/1 in the @WGCMexico. Pieters was second at Riviera recently and this course may share some similarities
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
327	327	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
807	807	3	3	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Anyone else feeling Grillo this week? I think this might be the big boys man party ive been predicting hes gonna crash very soon #ThePlayers
3849	3849	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Six starts, never has finished better than T-46. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Kevin Kisner. Runner-up here in 2015 and his game is such a good fit for Harbour Town.
720	720	17	17	target: Kim. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Better than feeling bad... All the An and Kang this week with a sprinkle of Lee and Kim. #TeamKorea https://t.co/TCc8MHOJgR
5266	5266	15	15	target: Finau: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully, an off week at The Players will drive Dick Fowler, P.I.’s ownership down. Tony Finau: $7,900  Finau has played the Memorial twice and hasn’t finished worse than 11th. He arrives having finished 30th-or-better in five of his last seven starts.
7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
10777	10777	3	3	target: Griffin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt e/w Lanto Griffin at 400/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) There have been surprise winners of this event before, so why not Griffin. This is obviously a massive step-up in class but his win last year at the Nashville Open kicked off a run of good form and two weeks ago he impressed with a T12 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
8954	8954	35	36	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The weather forecast for KL looks mixed with rain and thunderstorms a distinct possibility. Venue: TPC Kuala Lumpur (West), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Date: Oct 12-15  Course stats: par 72, 7,005 yards  Purse: $7,000,000  Defending champion: Justin Thomas (-23)  TV Coverage:  Thursday 12 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Friday 13 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Saturday 14 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Sunday 15 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Player Watch:  Justin Thomas is obviously going to be heavy favourite but he will face strong competition. There are a number of European players who might threaten, three of those are:  Paul Casey – He was on brilliant form in the second half of the season but was unable to convert and secure a victory.
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
3631	3631	14	15	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s in nice form coming in without being too spectacular for extremely high ownership. Bill Haas 100% – We took him 100% a couple of years ago and he rewarded us with a 12th place finish. He’s never missed a cut at this event and he’s coming in playing terrific golf.
11998	11998	21	21	target: Grillo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils. Whilst Grillo’s form last year wasn’t great coming in to the week as a really strong iron player I had felt this was a good track for him and this was something that had was backed up by his eye catching debut finish of 17th in 2016. It was therefore gratifying to see this theory rewarded by his solid play to finish 7th.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
5969	5969	43	43	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut at Erin Hills and doesn't have the look of a top-5 player at the moment, but he showed promise at the Memorial and turned in a runner-up at the Nelson. If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
11789	11789	22	23	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Showing signs of life recently, I'm going to try to jump aboard before the masses jump back on the Texan. DraftKings Picks:    Henrik Stenson ($10,200): Don't have to pay a premium for the Orlando resident that has finished T11 or better in all three visits to the Valspar. Matt Kuchar ($8,200): Should see his ownership plummet after a poor putting performance in Mexico.
13189	13189	1	1	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out. That effort at Bay Hill though was his sixth top-25 finish of the season, performing well at some correlating events.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
12822	12822	20	20	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Spieth won his first major here at the Masters, he added the US Open on his next major start. Thomas seems certain to kick on from his own first major and it would surely surprise no one were he to add a second at the very first opportunity having prepared so well for this. And now to the negative: Augusta National.
8801	8801	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!
937	937	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6. Alex Cejka - $7,300  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!

353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1403	1403	5	5	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyJesusDFS Did u factor in Noren hangover?
1126	1126	62	62	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Results: $3- 150 Entries Entered: Best Finished- 5 th $33- 10 Entries Entered: Best Finishes- 22 nd $300- 3 Entries Entered: 23 rd    Players Used: $3- 28 players used $33- 15 Players used $300- 10 Players used    Player Own %- 33* Kuchar*-60% Horschel-55% Kisner*-45.3% Swafford-45% Campbell/Bryan*-40% Cink/Stanley-35.3% Chappell*-28% ZJ*-22% Howell/Furyk/Glover-20%    Hero World Golf Showcase: This event hosted by the one and only Tiger features 18 golfers with 2 of the top players in the world, DJ and Jordan. With 18 players, you have to nail an almost perfect lineup to get a W, or even a top 10 in this week’s GPP. In an 18-player event, and his first tournament in over 13 months, how high will Tiger’s ownership be?
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
12070	12070	23	24	target: Bradley/Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
10541	10541	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate teams are no fun and don't help anyone. FanDuel Picks:    Zach Johnson ($10,600): He's fully synced up with his latest equipment from PXG. Typically runs hot or cold, so I will keep riding the hot streak while it's here.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
8862	8862	64	64	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has been playing some good golf lately and I look forward to seeing him play this week. He is a guy that has burned me more times than he has helped me out in Draftkings, but I have a feeling that a lot of other people will feel the same way and hopefully pivot to someone else in his price range like Kuchar, Garcia, Simpson, Reed, Hoffman, or Finau. I wouldn't call him a "core" player but he's the kind of guy you could see at the top of the leaderboard on Thursday and beat yourself up all weekend for not playing him.
7092	7092	0	1	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4. Not that we needed it, but that was a timely reminder of how good the two-time Open champ can be on links courses and T17 in the Travelers adds to the feeling that he’s in a good place again.
5942	5942	36	37	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To make things even more appetizing, Thomas tied for third at last year’s Travelers and will look to break through for his fifth career win, and first on the U.S. mainland. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts.
9983	9983	25	25	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's jump in and take a look at this weeks tag counts. $10K Range  The top tier is small with just five golfers but Rahm, Harman, and Mickelson lead the way in the tag count with Rahm sitting with a commanding lead in start recommendations. I will have the most exposure to Mickelson in this tier but think there is a nice pivot opportunity with Patrick Reed.
13189	13189	1	1	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out. That effort at Bay Hill though was his sixth top-25 finish of the season, performing well at some correlating events.
6828	6828	25	26	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Either way his play before last week was very solid and I know he burned some people, which usually translates to low ownership. Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies.
4652	4652	35	36	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course features plenty of sand so we don’t want our core players to be hacking away from the sand. Past Winners  2016 Sergio Garcia  2015 Steven Bowditch  2014 Brendon Todd  2013 Bae Sang-moon  2012 Jason Dufner  2011 Keegan Bradley  2010 Jason Day  Weather  The weather looks as if we could see some rain in the forecast. This will be important to monitor as a couple years ago the rain turned the course into a Par 69.
5740	5740	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said, the USGA set up each year is often quite similar, so looking back at who has had success at this event over their career is at least worth reviewing. Jason Day has played in the U.S. Open six times and only finished outside of the top-10 once. He has runner-up finishes from both 2011 at Congressional and 2013 at Merion.
6292	6292	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
3023	3023	5	5	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stay tuned! Core Players  Luke List ($9,900): List can absolutely crush the ball. The rough here isn’t as penal as we saw last weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational where the ball just stuck in the rough.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
1621	1621	15	15	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In addition to last week, his form in limited starts at Torrey Pines is solid. Cauley is the only pick this week that doesn’t have a top-10 here before but he does have two top-25’s in three starts. He finished T13 on debut in 2012 but missed the cut the following year.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2906	2906	92	93	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Sentry Tournament of Champions and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accurac y: 1) Tommy Fleetwood; 2) Ryan Armour / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley; 5) Vaughn Taylor; 6) Emiliano Grillo; 7) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Ryan Moore / Alex Noren; 10) Henrik Stenson; 11) Tyrrell Hatton; 12) Keegan Bradley / Kevin Streelman; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Brandt Snedeker; 16) Rickie Fowler / Zach Johnson; 18) Austin Cook / Brian Harman / Billy Horschel. Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley.
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
1066	1066	19	19	target: Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk 125/1 e/w. Dumped the PXG clubs and showed glimpses of form in the wrap around. Will back Every FRL just… https://t.co/nlXK2RBxtK
12707	12707	1	2	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely. I'm not sure how much credence we can give it but recent history suggests a late start on day one is beneficial as the last seven winners have all teed off late on day one.
8930	8930	3	4	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Knox  11. Anirban Lahiri  12. Peter Uihlein  13.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
1629	1629	6	6	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year. This is the highest of its kind since the Tour started collecting such records in 1983.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
1254	1254	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And until we see otherwise, Day is still among the very best putters in the game. Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
2339	2339	39	39	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As of now the worst weather over the first two days might actually be on Thursday morning but that can change in an instant obviously so make sure you re-check it Wednesday night before submitting your lineups. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($11,900): Arguments could be made for and against rostering all of the top four priced players this week on DraftKings but of the four Fowler stacks up the best for me. Since 2012 Rickie has made 5/5 cuts at PGA National and in 20 rounds has gone 69 or better ten times—and only shot worse than 72 twice in that span.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
13014	13014	74	74	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't forget he was 5th at the Open Championship and 10th at the Baltusrol-hosted PGA Championship in 2016 and I like his competitive streak whereby he isn't intimidated in the biggest tournaments. Great results across both Emirates Golf Club - 8th (2016), 3rd (2017) and 3rd (2018) and Crans-sur-Sierre - 3rd (2014), 3rd (2015) and 3rd (2017) tie in well with the last 2 winners here in Garcia and Willett, but I also like Hatton for his strong links with St Andrews as Augusta winners Tiger Woods, Zach Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia all have excellent records at the Home of Golf, as does 2016 champion Danny Willett. So getting on board the 2016 and 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links winner Hatton makes lots of sense to me at a rather tasty price.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
5218	5218	19	20	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
11767	11767	30	31	target: Charl Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although he did not look great last week at WGC Mexico I am not overly concerned as this course fits his style much more than what we saw last weekend. Charl Schwartzel – All Formats – DK: $7500 FD: $9800  Although Schwartzel has not seen his name atop a leaderboard in a while he has quietly been making plenty of cuts and has a great history here at Valspar. In the last two years Scwhartzel has finished T6 and won the event in 2016.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
6830	6830	11	13	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, let’s try and cultivate some John Deere Picks! Top Tier  Charles Howell III $9,000 – I like that we can roster him a little discount from last week. He hasn’t missed the cut here since 2012, which was his only one in 7 appearances.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
2484	2484	31	31	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ could make mincemeat of this course, Spieth could putt the lights out and Rory will be fresh and raring to go again after his break. It's a simple truth that Garcia has never won a major or WGC event but he does have 22 top 10s in the former and 12 in the latter. Seven of his WGC top 10s have come in this event although it's obviously been played at different venues and all are, in fact, top sevens.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
10459	10459	1	1	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside. Keegan was fourth in Strokes Gained: Approach at the Farmers, trailing only Goosen, Noren and Hadley.
4114	4114	37	38	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2452	2452	18	19	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tee-to-green behemoth with the ability to dominate this golf course as he has so many others. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – So he shot an 80 at Riviera on a tough, windy day. That shouldn’t make him $1,800 cheaper than DJ.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
11651	11651	14	15	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four career starts, he has a win and no finish lower than T20. Sergio Garcia  Sergio needs to fix his short game. Since coming stateside for the Honda, the reigning Masters champ has been Top 5 in the field at PGA National and in Mexico in Strokes Gained: Approach.
2028	2028	10	11	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
3640	3640	58	59	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A bunch of international stars have stepped up to make up for Day’s loss: Tyrrell Hatton, Danny Willet, defending champ Branden Grace, Martin Kaymer, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Shane Lowry, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Yuta Ikea, and Hideto Tanihara have all decided to get in another event since they’re all over in the US already. Toss in some second-tier PGA regulars like Bill Haas, Kevin Kisner, Marc Leishman, Russell Knox, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Charley Hoffman, Charles Howell, Jason Dufner, Dirt McGirt, Russell Henley, and Webb Simpson, and 19 off the world’s Top 50 ranked players will be on the grounds. Team RBC has captured five of the past seven Heritage titles, while international players donned golf’s worst sartorial honor the other two years in that stretch.
12708	12708	64	65	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having won the USPGA Championship in August, Justin Thomas has now won four of his last 14 starts and if he claims his second major in-a-row on Sunday he'll move to the top of the Official World Rankings. He would have done so if he'd have reached the final of the WGC-Match Play final two weeks ago but he admitted after his loss to Bubba Watson in the semi-final that moving to the top of the rankings was constantly on his mind. That's one concern, and so is his poor Augusta record.
8143	8143	11	12	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Enough with the BS let’s get to some picks. Winner Section  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Disclaimer: I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Jordan Spieth. Well mostly just hate.
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
851	851	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has a power game that travels well. Brooks Koepka. Has a power game that travels well.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
7958	7958	22	31	target: Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The North Carolina track has staged the regular-season Wells Fargo Championship (previously Quail Hollow Championship and Wachovia Championship) on 13 occasions and Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy is responsible for two of those victories and he’s also the only Euro to have tasted victory at this week’s course, Quail Hollow. With four wins in the last nine editions of the PGA Championship, Europe has reversed a dreadful record in the year’s final major.
6588	6588	24	24	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
7369	7369	5	6	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ will be just fine. Rory McIlroy – $11,000  What to do with Rory this week could actually be the million dollar question. He has been very bad lately, missing three of his last four cuts.
774	774	7	7	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@WellsFargoGolf PGA Picks Scott +1800 Berger +3300 McGirt +4000 Holmes +4000 Varner +10000 --- Reed +4000 Poston +11000 🇸🇪Porn👑 +25000
310	310	1	1	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, McIlroy value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP… https://t.co/9OP07g5IZt
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
11206	11206	42	43	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
416	416	7	7	target: Merritt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First @APinv bet is @TROYMERRITT_PGA at 469/1. Merritt is a @PGATOUR winner and should enjoy his Bay Hill return where he was 3rd last year
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome.

10954	10954	39	40	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Targeting a multitude of mid-tier golfers might be a better choice, as strong plays like Branden Grace, Tommy Fleetwood, Alex Noren and Marc Leishman can all be had for less than $10,000. Other strong targets for this format include Paul Casey, Branden Steele, Ollie Schniederjans, Martin Kaymer, Charles Howell III, Martin Laird and Brandon Harkins. Tournaments – It feels like a week where Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could easily go under-owned due to poor recent form or poor course history.
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
2571	2571	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide. He had back-to-back T3 finishes at Crans-sur Sierre in 2014 and 2015.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
7323	7323	35	35	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
6148	6148	38	39	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall though, scoring conditions will likely be ideal throughout, so expect regular low scores here and possibly something in the high teens to win. Last six winners  2016 –- Russell Knox -14 (over Jerry Kelly -13)  2015 — Bubba Watson -16 (over Paul Casey in playoff)  2014 — Kevin Streelman -15 (over Sergio Garcia and KJ Choi -14)  2013 — Ken Duke -12 (over Chris Stroud in playoff)  2012 — Marc Leishman -14 (over Charley Hoffman and Bubba Watson -13)  2011 — Fredrik Jacobson -20 (over Ryan Moore and John Rollins -19)  Winning Trends  Four of the last seven winners of the Travelers have been first-time winners on the PGA Tour. Three of the last four winners of this event were coming into the week off of missed cuts in their previous start.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
8370	8370	34	35	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Weekly Finalists:  My Favorites: You can see the entire list at mikeglasscott.com  Since none of the above are playing this week, time to get creative. My Choice: Webb Simpson  Close Second: Ryan Moore, Bill Haas  Outliers: Lucas Glover, Kyle Stanley, Haotong Li  Gut Shot(s): Kevin Na, Brandon Hagy  Rank Outsiders: Peter Malnati, William McGirt  QUESTION(S) OF THE WEEK:  Remember, if you don’t see a guy in my choices, it’s more than likely that I have already selected them. Who do I save???
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
12048	12048	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut. The following week Hatton’s ownership was much lower and we saw him finish T3 against a loaded field.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
3310	3310	28	29	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has top 20 upside this here this week and is a really nice value at only $7,300, that can be used in both cash games and GPPs. Jason Dufner: (7,100) Dufner is another player who is just way too cheap for how consistent he has been this season. The 70th ranked player in the world has been great, only missing one cut this season, and finishing no worse than T25 in all of the events he has made the cut.
4126	4126	9	9	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
1409	1409	6	6	target: Cabrera-Bello. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I see @DraftKings brought back Chalka Cabrera-Bello.
947	947	15	15	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First look at the #RSMClassic board, few long shots sticking out. Cook 80-1 Tway 100-1 Power 125-1 Wise 125-1 Ha… https://t.co/9aSkYXRGx2
814	814	4	4	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Par 4 Scoring – Koepka, Castro, Cauley, McGirt, Simpson  3. Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5.
4460	4460	11	11	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form here makes pretty grim reading, despite making 3/3 cuts. Grace has not managed to finish better than T42, as he seemingly struggles to put four rounds together here. In 2013 he posted a final round 77, to fall 30 places, after getting inside the top-10 earlier in the round.
11530	11530	79	80	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”  Last Week Rank: 16,851  Season Rank: 4872 *Did not play most of Segment 1*  Starters:  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Branden Grace  Marc Leishman  Bench:  Justin Thomas  Paul Casey        Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Mo Yoshimoto    “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Rank: 2063  Season Rank: 384  Starters:  Jordan Spieth  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Bubba Watson  Bench:  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay    ~    One-and-Done      Each week I will think out loud about my process in determining my One-and-Done selection. If you are new to the One-and-Done format, it is like an NFL survivor league.
3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
2645	2645	24	24	target: Haas: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be able to handle the altitude at Chapultepec and I am expecting a top 30 finish out of him this week. Bill Haas: (7,000) If you want to take the course manager approach this week with this being a course we are very unfamiliar with, Haas makes a lot of sense at his cheap price. He has yet to miss a cut this season and has finished no worse than 20th place with a T4 at the other WGC event this year, The HSBC Champions.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
4117	4117	43	44	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2032	2032	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
3843	3843	2	2	target: Kaymer: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Martin Kaymer: Kaymer has not missed a cut in his last 28 starts worldwide. He’s coming off his best Masters finish (by far) as he finished T16 last week on the back of a final round 68.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
2881	2881	4	4	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A no brainer. Tyrrell Hatton ($9,100) – “Impressive” would be putting it lightly for Tyrrell Hatton this year in his transition to being a part-time PGA player. Hatton contended for the win at the very tough PGA National and made a nice run in Mexico two weeks ago – he has not finished worse than T13 worldwide in his last four starts.
261	261	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is definitely hard enough to punish even some of the very best, so I would still consider it to be a potentially palatable investment opportunity. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Jason Day ($12,500) and Dustin Johnson ($12,100) – I hate to sound like a broken record here, but these two simply cannot be bested in terms of their sheer combination of power, accuracy, and precision. While they both bear some risk at their salary levels, I think it would be outrageous to fade them with their current form and proven ability to take this course apart.
6534	6534	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sky Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31. -- Michael Collins  DraftKings value picks  Nick Taylor  Taylor has been on a pretty hot run the past month or so, and we're going back to the well at this price.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship

172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
7398	7398	1	2	target: Kevin Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
12801	12801	15	15	target: Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory. Naturally you can treble your odds with 888Sport's exclusive new customer offer as per the details at the top of the page if you prefer.
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1561	1561	5	5	target: Bae 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Taken a chance on Sangmoon Bae at 169/1 and 13/2 for the top 20 in the #GenesisOpen. Bae loves Riviera and has fini… https://t.co/lpLOmpQz73

3028	3028	25	25	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
12575	12575	35	35	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will always be a popular player in terms of ownership, and generally the highest priced golfer gets a little bump just because. I will much rather spend the $100 less for the lower owned Rose who likely has a greater win probability. Luke List – $9,600  Welcome to Luke List chalk week.
8819	8819	38	38	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back him win only at 9/2. In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up.
8326	8326	543	544	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The MDF rule is in effect if more than 78 golfers make the original cut.

570	570	10	10	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
5227	5227	29	29	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His missed cut will still be hurting those he burned, and his price tag this week won’t be drawing them back in. $8,700 is a lot to pay for Dufner at this event, but he will not have any ownership on him this week so rostering 5% of him will likely put you overweight on him. He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
4556	4556	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better time than the PLAYERS. Rickie Fowler – $9,300  It is all or nothing for Rickie Fowler at TPC Sawgrass. Literally.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
198	198	9	9	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #careerbuilderchallenge Picks Reed 16-1 Casey 25-1 Rahm 28-1 Grillo 28-1 Lovemark 35-1 Piercy 50-1
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
10865	10865	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Martin Kaymer has been hitting the ball well for a while now It's possible that we don't see the best of him until he returns to the east coast, but Kaymer's record in California is very solid with just three stroke play starts, all in the US Open, all cuts made and two top-15 finishes. Kaymer has a phenomenally good record in the United States, winning two majors and a PLAYERS while also reaching the Match Play final in nearby Arizona, which used to be his winter base before he relocated to Florida.
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
12070	12070	24	24	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
2756	2756	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
4729	4729	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I cannot remember the last time I saw his price this low, along with his betting odds at 16/1, which seem long for a field of this strength. Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
11691	11691	22	23	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus. They are:  Chesson Hadley (5th in SG: Approach)  Ollie Schniederjans (12th in SG: Approach)  Chris Kirk (19th in SG: Approach)  Course experience is helpful here, although Woodland did win in debut in 2011, but course form is general is not a sticking point. Another thing to bear in mind this week is the sheer amount of Par 3’s (five) as well as four Par 5’s.
