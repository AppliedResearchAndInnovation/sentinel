If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Michael Kim: (6,900) Outside of his missed cut at The Memorial, Kim has been a very steady option over the last two months, making the cut in six of his last seven starts. He has been a strong putter and birdie maker all season, ranking 37th in strokes gained putting, and 56th in birdie or better percentage.
10126	10126	11	11	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m guessing it has a lot to do with next week. Rahm is set to defend his title at Torrey Pines, and there might be some extra eyeballs on TV screens, assuming Golf Channel can figure out its labor dispute and we actually see and hear what’s going on at the course. Rahm knows peaking at the Farmers Insurance Open will be worth a substantial amount of money when he’s likely to be paired with Tiger Woods, who just happens to be making his first competitive PGA Tour start in 12 months.
7212	7212	14	15	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can stun you at any time, especially when it comes to the Open. Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.

7625	7625	24	24	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively. They’re historically pricey while DJ is around his average; that should affect ownership, and indeed DJ is projected for the most ownership this week at 26-30 percent in our Models.
13521	13521	29	29	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key Stats for TPC San Antonio: SG: Off the Tee / SG: Approach / SG: Around the Green / DraftKings Scoring  Lock of the week:  Embed from Getty Images  Luke List $10,000 – As crazy as it seems to play List at $10K, you can’t argue with the form and stats. Luke has gained over 29 strokes total in the last six weeks on the PGA Tour. He’s 1st in SG: App, 3rd in SG: OTT and 35th in SG: ATG in the last 12 rounds.
12781	12781	11	12	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charl Schwartzel: 30th Houston/47th Bay Hill/24th Doral/14th PGA National/8th Abu Dhabi. Phil Mickelson: 35th Houston/30th Bay Hill/14th Doral/24th TPC Scottsdale. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their wave and winning score since 2010.
12825	12825	15	15	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yet there may be more to his play at Augusta than his finishing positions reveal. Thomas has in fact found the nature and flow of the course fits him perfectly, just as it should, but hasn't yet been able to score quite well enough. Were he to win on Sunday, the US PGA champion would be far from alone in terms of how his first couple of looks at Augusta actually did point to his victory.
3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
12719	12719	16	17	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's understandably a shorter price than he perhaps should be and he's definitely not for me. Jordan Spieth is a fascinating contender. His course form record is sensational and in three of the four years he's played here he's traded at odds-on.
2129	2129	7	8	target: Dustin Johnson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Justin Thomas; 3) Daniel Berger; 4) Matt Kuchar / Phil Mickelson; 6) James Hahn; 7) Padraig Harrington; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Chris Stroud; 10) Brian Gay; 11) Tommy Fleetwood; 12) Cameron Smith; 13) Alex Noren; 14) Dominic Bozzelli / Si Woo Kim; 16) Retief Goosen; 17) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Peter Malnati; 19) Wesley Bryan / J.B.

3089	3089	29	30	target: Ben Crane 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week. Jeff Bergerson: Ben Crane ($6,500) on DraftKings  In weaker fields like this week's Puerto Rico Open, I love looking at our Sportsbook Odds vs. Daily Pricing Tool on our site to help me find the best value plays. One of those great values that is revealed is Ben Crane at $6,800.
1270	1270	15	15	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top 5 Cash Plays (Emphasis on Safe Floor and Solid Avg. Projection) 1. Leishman 2. Fowler 3. Harman 4. Cink 5. Matsuyama
4046	4046	19	19	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also played well last week in Harbour Town finishing a respectable T22 which included a final round 69. Hadwin also looks good here statswise ranking 15th in SG tee to green, third in scrambling, 18th in strokes gained putting and fourth in par 3 scoring. If he keeps up his good run of form this week he could be right in the mix.
4135	4135	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is an elite ball striker and his hitting a ton of greens in regulation this season. Finau has been known to struggle on Bermuda greens, but this course has allowed bad putters to win in the past. Finau will very popular this week, so if you want to reap the rewards of a high Finau finish, you will need to roster him in over 30% of your lineups.
11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
7813	7813	16	17	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is too talented to remain in this form forever. Other Options: Rory McIlroy    Mid-Tier Plays    Daniel Berger (DK: $8,300, FD: $6,900)  This is the site of Berger’s infamous one shot, then withdraw last year. It absolutely burned me last year, but I’m going to go back to the well.
1086	1086	27	27	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is great news for GPP's and I also believe there is enough safety here to use him in cash games, especially in head to heads. Anirban Lahiri  World Golf Ranking (78)  Vegas Odds (41/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FantasyAces ($5,150)    I am sticking with Lahiri this week who actually seen a price decrease of $300 after a T28 last week. He has been dynamite to start both tournaments this season with six rounds under 70 and could easily have a win and contended for another had he been able to close out on Sunday with a 72 in both tournaments.
4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
8562	8562	26	27	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuch looks good value here to keep up his good run of form. Final Selections –  Jordan Speith 10/1 2pts EW  Jason Day 16/1 1pt EW  Patrick Reed 33/1 1pt EW  Matt Kuchar 35/1 1pt EW  Total staked = 10 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf.

5310	5310	16	16	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8 of his last 12 rounds here have been in the 60s and as we know Billy loves hard golf courses and is very par-70 positive. Horschel always looks forward to his visit to TPC Southwind, a course he truly loves as his comments in this 2015 interview highlight, "I think it's underappreciated. I think this is an underrated golf course.
1093	1093	33	34	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a "home" game for Kuchar, so this year playing on two courses (Seaside and Plantation) should give him just a slight advantage over many of the other players. Jonathan Coachman -- Zach Johnson ($9,700)  This week I am going with someone who is always comfortable playing in this part of the country because he lives there -- Johnson. He hasn't had the year he would have wanted, but winning in the final event of 2016 can change all of that.
1228	1228	4	5	target: Julian Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			when you see that Julian Suri is playing on the PGA Tour this week https://t.co/BNcuAvFSao
9152	9152	5	5	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although a small sample size, Hadley is near the top of the field in every statistical category I’m targeting this week. He posted a 5th place finish in 2013, which bodes well for his chances this week. Because he’s had PGA Tour status before, he’s played TPC Summerlin numerous times.
12727	12727	29	29	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How the 2017 Masters was won  Last year as noted, Garcia won his first major, doing so at a course he had previously stated he could never win at. Rose pushed him all the way on the back-9, after capitalising on two mistakes from the Spaniard on holes 10 and 11, which gave him a two stroke lead. A miraculous par-save on 13 ultimately ended up being a springboard for better things to come for Garcia, as Rose’s birdie putt slid by.
2543	2543	3	3	target: Willett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course. Look at where Willett tends to contend, and there’s a common theme: definition from the tee. Tree-lined golf courses are without doubt those he prefers, from Augusta to Fanling and stopping at various places – Milano, Saujana, Kuala Lumpur, Wentworth, Crans – inbetween.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
11555	11555	21	22	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, I'd prefer to have him later in the year, likely in a major. Other golfers on my 'save" list are Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler. Hatton is attractive because course history/experience isn't that relevant this week and there aren't many future spots you'll be dying to use him.
2232	2232	10	10	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm willing to bank on that happening. Zach Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($6,600)  Sometimes, it's easiest to just not overthink things when it comes to how DraftKings prices golfers each week. I wrote about Hadwin last week and he produced value yet again.
3858	3858	14	15	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like him in cash or GPP formats on DraftKings this week. Value Plays  Matthew Fitzpatrick $8,300 – FitzMagic is in wonderful form having not missed a cut since January. He’s a total ball striker with accuracy off the tee being his specialty.
2268	2268	29	29	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005. Scott is hitting just under 75% of greens in regulation and is one of the biggest hitters on tour. With a great record here and decent current form the Aussie could be one to watch here.
13652	13652	3	3	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist. That's a potent combination for The Players Championship and Kisner seems the sort who could win this at a bulky price.
13214	13214	12	12	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below are the golfers who fit it this week. Casey  Kuchar  Harman  Cook  Glover  Landry  The top three aren’t a surprise, but the bottom three may test the trend! Cook, Glover, and especially Landry, don’t have the sharpest form coming into this week.
4151	4151	35	35	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior. While he struggles with the flatstick, Grace is an adept approach player, placing 13th on Tour in strokes gained: approach last year. Middling  Ian Poulter: $7,900  Poults has never needed it more.
8913	8913	25	25	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is a bit of a risky pick to roll with a guy who has very limited experience playing on the PGA Tour. However, if Uihlein is going to pick up a PGA Tour win in the 2017-2018 season, the fall swing season seems like an ideal time to get the job done. Ollie Schniederjans – $8,300  Similar to Uihlein, Ollie Schniederjans has to be one of the favourites to pick up his first career win in the fall swing series.
9915	9915	11	11	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Beau was 3rd after 54 holes in Jackson, and in Las Vegas he shot a field-leading -5/66 in the teeth of the Saturday wind to take a step further and lead after 54 holes. 2nd at the Air Capital Classic at Crestview CC in Wichita appeals - PGA West champions Dufner, Vegas, Perez and Swafford have all performed well there, and despite missing the cut on his 2018 debut last week, Hossler was still hitting 80.6% Greens in Regulation. Of the rookies, he could be a real surprise this week.
12816	12816	26	26	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But who wins it? Likely one of the first seven or eight in the betting, none of whom appear to be more likely winners than Justin Thomas, who gets the vote at 10/1 with bumper each-way terms, 11/1 generally or as big as 14/1 via the exchanges. While every player at the front of the betting has much to recommend but also a question or two to answer, Thomas holds what appear to me to be the most solid credentials.
1758	1758	47	48	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However you need to hit greens here period - a category where Phil currently sits 166th. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Justin Thomas ($11.5m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m): 3: Ryan Moore ($8.6m); 4: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.7m); 5: Chez Reavie ($6.8m); 6: Jon Rahm ($9.7m); 7: Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); 8: Brian Harman ($7.7m); 9: Jim Herman ($6.6m); 10: Sean O'Hair ($6.9m). Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select this week at a relatively low $8.6 million.
11669	11669	14	14	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This also included a change of coach. The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day.
4676	4676	16	17	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf: Top DraftKings Picks for the AT&T Byron Nelson  May 16, 2017 Dustin Diez  Sharelines Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka headline our top #DraftKings picks at the Byron Nelson. #fantasygolf  Most of the world's best golfers will take this week off after The Players Championship, but there are still some very nice anchors for your DraftKings lineups at the AT&T Byron Nelson. Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, and Jordan Spieth headline the event; after that, it's a pretty big drop off.
7255	7255	21	21	target: Johnson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota. Johnson’s a leading favorite to win this week along with Spieth, and though I don’t think he picks up career major number two, DJ should be in contention on Sunday and I expect him to finish inside the top-10. Winner Prediction  I referenced earlier that The Open tends to favor older players.
2542	2542	46	46	target: Willett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Willett fought back from a nightmare start to shoot an opening 69 and was three-under with seven to play in round two, only for a couple of bogeys followed by a double at the difficult 17th to see him miss out by one. The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course. Look at where Willett tends to contend, and there’s a common theme: definition from the tee.
122	122	12	12	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson, Spieth, Mickelson, Walker and Koepka have all safely qualified. Holmes, Watson, Kuchar, Fowler and Furyk amongst those down to 22nd in the current standings (see above) still have a shot at qualifying automatically this week. From there Davis Love III announces 3 of his 4 Captain's Picks after the BMW Championship (3rd of 4 events), with his final selection being announced after the Tour Championship.
10406	10406	12	13	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus. Nine Bridges: Justin Thomas; EW Places: Leishman, Cam Smith, Whee Kim, Brown, Lahiri, List, Lovemark. TPC Summerlin: Patrick Cantlay; EW Places: Whee Kim, Cejka, Hadley, Kizzire, Hossler, Hoge Bradley, DeChambeau.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
2102	2102	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
67	67	26	26	target: Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
3225	3225	1	1	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week. The 2014 FedEx Cup champion will be desperate to return to Augusta, where he posted a career-best T17 finish last year.
11297	11297	22	22	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I personally will be splitting them in my GPP lineups but if you are looking to go contrarian you will get Rory McIlroy and Alex Noren at a big ownership discount this week. I would lean McIlroy who has been a good wind player over the years and also has a bit of course history as he finished 2nd here back in 2014. He also bounced back from a missed cut at Pebble Beach with a T20 at the Genesis so you could say he is trending in the right direction.
5487	5487	3	4	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
5084	5084	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose , Kevin Chappell & Ryan Moore – Keeping things pretty chalky in the B-List, with a troika of former champs and a player on the ascent. Kuch has made nine cuts in a row at The Memorial, highlighted by a win in 2013, six Top 10s, and no finish worse than T26. If the course was designed by Pete Dye or Jack Nicklaus, you always play Kuchar… Hideki missed the cut last season following a win and a T5 in his first two appearances.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
4288	4288	7	8	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Starting cash lineups is a great idea. Bud Cauley ($9,400): WD on Tuesday Cauley sees a massive price jump this week as he was only $6,900 the last time out on DraftKings at the Valero. He’s now recorded three top tens in a row however and it has been mostly on the back of some great tee to green work which bodes extremely well for this week.
5464	5464	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  See above. You have to drop down to Kevin Chappell at $8,800 for a player approaching what Mickelson brings to the table. He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints.
10205	10205	13	14	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, it may be enough to keep other owners away. -- Zach Turcotte  Tiger Woods  It is difficult to target a golfer making his first competitive start with FedEx Cup points on the line since this event last year, but in this case, the golfer is Tiger Woods. There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event.
7212	7212	15	15	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can stun you at any time, especially when it comes to the Open. Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
3899	3899	27	27	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero may be tough, but Hadwin has risen to virtually every challenge he’s faced thus far, and his short game should serve him quite well here. Stewart Cink ($7,400) – Cink may have had a bad stretch for a few holes on the back nine last week, but that should not overshadow an incredibly consistent year of golf from a guy who is already known for being super consistent to begin with. Cink has the versatility required to at least make the cut for you this week, and if his form serves, he’s quite capable of doing more than that on tough courses as well.
5170	5170	21	22	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When a course requires the top ball strikers, you fit Hideki into your lineups. Also Consider: Byeong Hun An, Jon Rahm, Rickie Fowler, Marc Leishman, Emiliano Grillo  Sleepers  Here is a list of GPP plays, or sleepers if you will, that could be lower owned and have some upside to them. You do not need much ownership on these players to be overweight the field.
3959	3959	13	14	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s. Koepka admitted he lost his game for a while this season but the 27-year-old came back to form by making the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play.
2028	2028	11	11	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
9935	9935	24	24	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer has also only missed the cut twice in that span, so he generally sticks around for the whole week here. Off the course Palmer has been having massive problems with both his Wife’s and his own health but his tweet after his T58 in Hawaii suggests the stresses are getting easier. In a tweet this past Sunday, Palmer wrote “Happiest T58 I’ve ever had.
363	363	18	18	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Quick thoughts on @ValsparChamp: Everyone is going to be all over Haas. Could be a good time for Hadwin. Luke Donald - not so sneaky play
7173	7173	30	31	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course was last played in 2008 when Padraig Harrington took home the Claret Jug. In that year a few current players finished high up on the leaderboard; Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey all finished within the top 10. All three of these players share a few traits within their games; they are all accurate off of the tee and great tee-to-green.
9279	9279	26	26	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
4538	4538	1	1	target: Rose: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose: Rose has alternated two missed cuts with fourth- and 19th-place finishes here the past four years, but he is playing some of the best golf of his career currently: His 66.8 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks second among golfers in the field with more than one start the past six weeks. Importantly, Rose’s 20.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg ranks second overall. Martin Kaymer: Kaymer’s 69.1 LT Adj Rd Score ranks 25th, and he’s tied for 23rd in the field with his 14.2 LT Adj Bird Avg.
5603	5603	47	48	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The cost per session was $125, albeit free for me, and worth every penny for those who glided four rounds with the most mechanically gifted swinger of the golf club maybe ever. I don't know when it hit me Sunday, but at some point I realized, damn, Dustin Johnson is kind of built to win U.S. Opens.
4208	4208	27	27	target: Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s the inaugural version of this event, so not much to talk about in the way of past winners. The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner.
935	935	7	7	target: Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Brown, SW Kim &amp; Rodgers in RSM Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
5710	5710	23	23	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we will be avoiding him for two reasons. First, Kaymer is a terrible chipper around the greens and going back to our Kisner interview this week, you’re going to have to chip the ball well off these closely shaved areas around the green. Second, he’s going to be extremely popular when people see the name, pedigree, and price tag.
3496	3496	32	32	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thomas called his former Alabama team-mate, Lee Knox as soon as he qualified for the Masters last year, organising to stay with him throughout the week. The advantage of doing so, was Thomas managed to go out on practice rounds with Lee’s father, Jeff who we all know very well. Knox is the non-playing marker at Augusta National, and if required (when an odd number of players make the cut) often beats his playing partners, although his score is never official.
7704	7704	21	22	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
3872	3872	45	45	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, with that being so critical this week, it makes him a risky proposition despite his pedigree. However his play at The Masters has me thinking he’s started to get his driver corrected, and, if that’s the case, expect a slot on the Sunday leaderboard… Chappell has struggled through identical issues as Walker. He lost to the ability to drive the ball effectively.
4078	4078	15	15	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA Tour Fantasy Golf DraftKings Picks – Valero Texas Open  Lock of the week:  Brendan Steele $9,900 – Steele is a major steal in our cash and GPP lineups this week. He’s been extremely consistent this season having not missed a cut all year. Southern Texas is also the site of his first PGA Tour victory.
231	231	13	14	target: J Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five for Pebble Beach: C Smith 125/1, S Cink 150/1, M Thompson 175/1, J Hahn 200/1, G Owen 200/1. 365 have nice top20 prices for latter four
7205	7205	34	34	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old. Also like: Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
3661	3661	29	29	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One week after that debut at Augusta he was invited here, and he finished T23 when still an amateur. Despite missing the cut this time last year, I feel Fitzpatrick has an excellent chance to make that splash on the PGA Tour that many are expecting. His putting is a strength of his, just like his fellow countrymen, Luke Donald who has a brilliant track record here at Harbour Town.
2230	2230	2	3	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jeff Bergerson: J.B. Holmes ($7,100)  As long as DraftKings is going to offer bargain basement pricing for some of the absolute best players in the world, I am going to buy. Holmes has not been lighting the world on fire thus far this year, but his worst finish since last summer is T35. In his past nine appearances at Riviera, he has missed only one cut and has six top-15 finishes.
7872	7872	33	34	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only reason I'm leaving him on the bench to begin with is because I have one start remaining. EXPERT BEN EVERILL , Staff Writer LINEUP | BENCH Jason Day  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Adam Scott  Dustin Johnson  Rory McIlroy  PROJECTED CHAMPION Adam Scott Former champion needs a kick for his season to be up to standard. Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can.
8481	8481	60	60	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given that the schedule was different owing to golf's return to the Olympics last year, that's actually four from six so a close look at the PGA Championship leaderboard is as good a starting point as any. That makes in-form Matt Kuchar interesting in an event he's won before, but at a bigger price I prefer the claims of Louis Oosthuizen given the potential for this event to favour big-hitters. Oosthuizen completed a career grand slam of runner-up finishes in the majors as he shared second with Reed at Quail Hollow, and that's further proof of how big-time he is despite so often proving frustrating.
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
1494	1494	65	66	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's definitely not for me at around [30.0], even though he has form here, having finished 10th on debut in 2015. Selections  Rain will irritate the field for most of the week, temperatures will be far cooler than the norm and we'll even get a bit of wind so I fancy it could be a week for a wily old patient pro, so step forward Zach Johnson. The 40-year multiple winner is simply too big at [32.0] after his eye-catching performance last week at the Sony where he ranked 17th for GIR and eighth for Putting Average.
9466	9466	13	14	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if there’s one thing yours truly loves to see, it’s consistency, and Kyle Stanley was an absolute monster in that department, carding an average of 1.259 SG:T2G per round despite playing a very busy 29 event schedule. Incidentally, in those 29 events, Stanley also posted a very impressive twelve top-25 finishes to go with five top-tens and a win at the brutal Quicken Loans National at TPC Potomac. The other thing I love in my DFS golfers is when they are consistently bad at one particular thing, just like Swafford with his scrambling last year.
8815	8815	39	39	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Spieth rates the award highly and, as if winning two trophies and a $10million jackpot wasn't enough, it's another factor to motivate him. Justin Thomas has five wins, including a major, and must be favourite at it stands but Spieth could still change the script. "I think I have to win the tournament to be Player of the Year or at least have a chance to be Player of the Year and that's our MVP, that's the most important award," he said last Sunday.
3081	3081	24	25	target: Thorbjorn Olesen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Player Odds DK Price Comparables Martin Flores 90-1 $6,800 Andres Romero $6,900 and 125-1  Hunter Mahan $6,800 and 125-1  D.A. Points $6,900 and 150-1 Thorbjorn Olesen 60-1 $7,700 Willy Wilcox $7,900 and 80-1  Sam Saunders $7,800 and 100-1  Andrew Johnston $7,900 and 80-1  HORSES FOR COURSES  Scott Brown is a former winner of this event who in five starts at this event has only finished outside of the top 10 once. He finished 5th here last season but comes in on the back of some bad form as he had a terrible missed cut at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week.
7837	7837	28	28	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS. Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign.
7176	7176	30	30	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
8978	8978	2	3	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 125/1 Paddy Power The competition is less fierce than a normal PGA Tour event and his ball-striking should out him in contention. He might excel in the early part of the season away from the spotlight.
3919	3919	20	20	target: Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now tweets alone are not enough to go by, but I do believe him. With a baby on the way, Peterson needs to start cashing cheques and realising his potential, something a lot of players tend to do when facing parenthood for the first time. There are other indicators that this can be a good sport for Peterson also.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9664	9664	32	33	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average. Selections:  Daniel Berger @ [44.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [60.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [85.0]  Chris Stroud @ [160.0]    I'll be back tomorrow with a preview of the EurAsia Cup which begins on Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
3972	3972	1	1	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ryan Moore and Adam Hadwin were others who caught my eye. Moore had an excellent Masters until falling away on Sunday to finish T9. He also posted T8 at this venue on his only start in 2012.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
1252	1252	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes (7.4k) - not accurate off the tee yet has 33/6/2/23 L4 here. (DA was under 45% each time). Wish his for… https://t.co/MjIQAYaJcI
10134	10134	35	36	target: Scott Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He still can’t putt, but his irons returned in a big way at the Sony, and with his familiarity with these greens, an average putting week again could lock in a top-10 spot. Ditto for Scott Piercy. Coming off an injury-plagued 2017, he too got his irons back on track at the Sony and historically is one of the premier par-4 scorers in the field.
10742	10742	11	11	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His past five years here shook out in finishes of 5/11/4/64/6. Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure.
484	484	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on. Jason Day ($9,300): Speaking of putting, the Aussie is in a class of his own with it comes to putting this year. Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end.
4475	4475	43	43	target: Henley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well. Jordan Spieth ($10800): After a week where the talk was Dustin Johnson’s (almost) triumphant return to the links, it’s easy for most to forget just how good Jordan Spieth actually is.
13257	13257	15	15	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have gamer's remorse, well, there you go. Just as he was last year, Donald is my pick. If you don't like it, ask yourself if you're stereotyping for whatever motivation.
13130	13130	21	21	target: Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			35th in the Corales Championship featured a 2nd Round -6/66 which was the 3rd best round of the day and powered Every into contention - he eventually finished 35th. The week after in Houston, which has MiniVerde Bermuda base greens, Every shot a Round 1 -5/67 good enough for 10th. A Sunday -6/66 then propelled Matt into an 8th place finish, good enough for a $182,000 pay cheque.
12865	12865	1	1	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But Scott’s ability to get to the green is slowly returning to an elite level, and that’s what we should all care about this week. Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott.
1380	1380	1	1	target: @ScottPiercyPGA 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @ScottPiercyPGA at 74/1 in the #WasteManagementOpen. Piercy showed some very positive signs in the desert at… https://t.co/GkIfeyNt42
11204	11204	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has done well at PGA National, with top-15s in three of the past four years. Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago.
8458	8458	52	52	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don’t charge for the stats, all we ask is you please take a few minutes to help us out by rating/subscribing/reviewing the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE  Key Stats:  SG: T2G  SG: Approach  Driving Distance  P4 Scoring  App: 175-200 yards  Birdie %  Outright Bets:  Day 18/1  Finau 66/1  Hoffman 66/1  Moore 100/1  Xander 150/1 Check out the rolling stats! Stop using stats from March and April to make your plays!
5005	5005	19	19	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take advantage of the price gift DK is giving you this week and lock him in your lineups. Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour.
4057	4057	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
12282	12282	38	38	target: Campos 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at 36 and 54 holes at the Puerto Rico Open was the launchpad and although Rafael finished 10th, that was enough to earn a further main-Tour start at the Houston Open. The trip to Texas again saw Campos in contention and he earned a lot of respect that week, taking a great each-way return with 7th spot. 32nd at The Heritage then followed and from there he went on to again tackle the web.com Tour for a second time.
6847	6847	45	45	target: McNealy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“This will give me a little more info on how my game stacks up out here,” he revealed. “It is a pretty special place to come and a dream come true to be out here and I feel like I am knocking on the door.”  McNealy is in enviable position - his father is a Silicon Valley billionaire so it won’t really matter which career path McNealy the younger does eventual land on. There is a little or no pressure on him at the moment with an exciting summer ahead and he does not look out of his depth in the slightest here in a very beatable field if some of the bigger names fail to fire.
9855	9855	30	31	target: J.J. Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plenty of people have pegged Finau as a big time break out player this year, and a win this week would be a huge start to the season for Tony. J.J. Spaun – $7,600  J.J. Spaun comes in ranked first in my weighted stat model this week because he finished the 2017 season hot as hell. Perhaps it is lucky for us that he didn’t pick up his first career title in the fall swing season and was saving it for the 2018 Sony Open.
73	73	25	26	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH OUT!!!! 2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Ryan Moore $10,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Brandt Snedeker $9,800  Kevin Na $9,100  2016 John Deere Classic DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Rafa Cabrera-Bello $8,900  William McGirt $8,700  Scott Piercy $8,500  Kevin Kisner $8,300  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Ben Martin $8,000  Jason Dufner $7,900  Billy Horschel $7,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Luke Donald $7,000  Camilo Villegas $6,400  Roberto Castro $6,000  Seung-Yul Noh $5,600  Rickie Fowler $11,700  Webb Simpson $10,200  Russell Henley $9,000  JB Holmes $8,100  Shane Lowry $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

7360	7360	12	12	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's the same game plan I had last time we were here." Stenson didn't have his best stuff at the Scottish Open last week but he closed with a 68 for T26 and his best Open results have come when he's warmed up on the links in Scotland. He may also have noted that Padraig Harrington came to Royal Birkdale as the defending champion in 2008 and retained the Claret Jug.
9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
6224	6224	41	41	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A good putting week and he'll be very dangerous on a course like this. I don't want to be backing anyone at short prices this week given the lack of course form so therefore I'm happy to take the 50/1 about Bradley rather than the short odds for Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. Bill Haas and Brendan Steele have good credentials but between them they have a win apiece since 2013 so I'm not overly enthused about either at 25/1.
2772	2772	35	36	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After regaining some self-confidence, look for Bubba to start posting some low numbers starting this week at Innibrook, a place where he has posted a top 3 before. Others to Consider: Charles Howell III ($9,400), Bill Haas ($9,200), Webb Simpson ($8,500), Graham DeLeat ($8,400), Tony Finau ($7,700), Chris Kirk ($6,900)  Player projections, stats models, DFS lineup builders and much more!

310	310	3	4	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
2296	2296	14	14	target: Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of course all that matters is that Harrington got it done when it counted. Berger, who was born and educated in Florida would have been hoping for a successful return in 2016 however he failed to make the cut, with opening rounds of 73-72. Leading into the event last year, Berger’s recent results read MC-58-MC-42, so it was perhaps not a surprise he missed the cut.
8933	8933	3	3	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray  16. Scott Hend  17. Adam Hadwin  18.
11166	11166	10	10	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Noren is also 40th in scrambling. Tier 2 Values    Gary Woodland - $9,700 (25-1)  Woodland is the rare player who hits it far off the tee yet is accurate. He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation.
4158	4158	11	11	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year.
12386	12386	35	35	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's the ultimate wild card because you're likely going to burn him at some point, but you still wouldn't miss him if you didn't. Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format.
10418	10418	29	30	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His tee-to-green proficiency has already yielded a trio of top 10s this season, and with a taut short game (31st in scrambling), he's 21st on TOUR in adjusted scoring. Robert Garrigus … Profiles as the kind of bomber that makes sense on occasion at TPC Scottsdale, just as long as his putter is cooperating. The 14th club has been both his bane and boon over the years.
7697	7697	26	27	target: Paul Casey. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Disappointed at Royal Birkdale, but he has a good record at Firestone, which isn’t surprising considering his ballstriking talent. Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
5818	5818	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose’s 2017 stats aren’t quite as sharp as always but he still sits prominently in many of the key ones for this week. Rose is 25th in driving distance, 14th in GIR, 13th in strokes gained: tee to green and 10th in scoring relative to par for approaches over 200 yards. Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong.
9495	9495	33	34	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lower down, Hideki Matsuyama is a near lock at under $10K given his course history, and Brooks Koepka should garner heavy consideration at $9,400, too. Some potential value plays include Ryan Armour ($6,200), Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000), Brendan Steele ($7,400) and Cam Smith ($7,600). Tournaments: Given that Fowler has the worst course history of the top-three golfers, he might be the best target in tournaments ownership-wise.
393	393	0	1	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick. However, he began the year hot, looking more and more like his old self, especially with his putter.
5002	5002	13	13	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – DEAN & DELUCA Invitational  Lock of the week:  Sergio Garcia $10,800 – We absolutely love Sergio this week on a course that should set up well for a tremendous ball striker like he is. Strokes Gained off the Tee and Strokes Gained Approach are two of our favorite stat categories this week and Garcia is amongst the top 20 in the field in both. The Spaniard faltered a little on Sunday last week but had a tremendous back nine 29 on Saturday and is still on a heater coming off that Masters win in April.
12142	12142	33	34	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With little wind forecast for day one scoring is bound to be low , making a confident touch on Bermuda greens imperative." *EW Terms: 1/4 Odds | 5 Places  Steve Rawlings says: Back Bubba Watson @ 40/1  Bubba Watson is a mercurial character and there isn't a venue played that doesn't highlight his unpredictability better than Bay Hill. It was in this event in 2014 that he withdrew after shooting an 11-over-par 83 in the opening round, which included an 11 at the par five sixth hole!
3915	3915	31	31	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whilst based on his season so far, 40/1 may look short and a slight overreaction to his Masters finish, it was his play when in-form last year that justify his odds. Chappell has not suddenly become a bad player, he was just going through a bad patch (not surprising given his run last year), and he may just have found his form again at Augusta. It is worth remembering Chappell’s strong showing at the FedEx Cup play-offs, finishing 2nd at the season-ending Tour Championship and 8th at the Deutsche Bank Championship, proving he has plenty of game, on the biggest of stages.
10944	10944	9	9	target: Chez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fleetwood has all the tools to win at Riviera. Chez Reavie – $8,000  I missed the wagon on Chez last week after he followed up his Waste Management runner-up with another second place finish. Chez has clearly found something in his game and it is firing on all cylinders right now.
13031	13031	24	25	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him into your cash games, but also include him into your GPPs because he has a really high ceiling here. -- Jeff Bergerson  Ryan Moore  Moore has had a fantastic time at Augusta, playing it nine times and only missing the cut twice -- including four top-25s, one of which was last year's T9. He's been having a good year relative to his price point, with a T5 just a few weeks ago at Bay Hill, and a T9 at Riviera which is a good companion course to Augusta.
10847	10847	27	27	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Until he misses a cut or puts in a poor performance, it really is hard to overlook his current run, even in such a big event. Keegan Bradley 80/1 (Skybet 7 places 1/5, SportingBet 5 places 1/4) 1pt e/w:  Much like Reavie, Bradley is a great statistical fit for the event, what’s more, he has course form to boot. In seven starts at Riviera, Bradley has as many top-4 finishes as he does missed cuts (2), and also has two other top-20 finishes to add to the collection.
11679	11679	8	8	target: Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Geddit? First selection has to row along with Bozzelli especially after that 13th last time in a good class field at PGA National. His 10th in the St.Jude last year gives further evidence to his ability in these conditions and all that after being very comfortable in front when winning his maiden web.com event.
335	335	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very minimal research but on top of DJ and Spieth I really like JT this week. Vegas And Haas for cheap. Woody Phil and Reed too.
3956	3956	29	29	target: Steele, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one factor going in his favour this week is that putting doesn’t correlate that strongly with finish positions on Bermudagrass (about 0.20 correlation, vs. 0.45 on Bentgrass). Like Steele, Finau has had some weight behind him this week in the DFS community and will be fairly highly owned. Greg Owen ($6400): Although he’s been around since before the Earth was formed (turned pro in 1992), Greg Owen has been fantastic in every sense of the word this year in getting from tee to green.
2345	2345	39	40	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
4674	4674	2	3	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			GPP ONLY. Nick Taylor $6,900  Welp, there ya go. The top 17 (no idea how I keep landing on that number of picks every week) for this week if playing on DraftKings.
7928	7928	0	0	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie enters the week as the 11th-ranked golfer in the world and is coming off three solid weeks – Bridgestone is still pending so it’s excluded – with finishes of T22, T3, and T5 before his last missed cut at the St. Jude. Fowler also finished T11 at Augusta, and although he’s yet to win a major his track record with high finishes in majors combined with his track record at Quail Hollow are positive signs. In the last six years at this course, the diminutive candidate for BPTNWAM has won (2012), made the cut with mediocre finishes twice, and finished T4 last year.
132	132	19	19	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That fact is backed up by his win at Baltusrol which ticks the won 'Up-State' box. However, for me, Walker will want to build on his PGA Championship success. He grabs me as a level-headed sort who has already won twice in quick succession in his career: 2014: Waialae/Pebble Beach; 2015: Waialae/TPC San Antonio.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
5101	5101	8	8	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also 7th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season, Fowler boasts some impressive form at the other PGA Tour stop in Ohio. That's the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone CC, a long par 70 with testing par 4s, and Fowler has cracked the top 10 in his last three appearances there. In short, he would appear to have the perfect game to shine at Muirfield Village.
12797	12797	61	61	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money. A winner of the Farmers Insurance Open in January, a course that has seen Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson triumph in the past, Day captured his 11th PGA Tour title and first for 20 months. From there 2nd at Pebble Beach and a competitive 22nd at Bay Hill after a month's inactivity highlight a player who's playing some decent stuff under the radar.
803	803	8	8	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.
12150	12150	26	26	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should go well and I’ll be backing him for a top 10. Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season.
11171	11171	4	4	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $12100 – JT has two missed cuts and a third-place finish at PGA National, but don’t let his up-and-down results turn you away from one of the best in the field. Thomas has morphed into a better player each year and his maturity should land him much closer to another top-5 than a missed cut this week. Sergio Garcia, $11900 – Making his first PGA Tour start on U.S. soil this year, Sergio should have plenty of confidence on a venue where he has notched three top-15s in his last four trips.
6113	6113	42	42	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. This week’s OWGR chart has some very interesting standouts this week, one of whom is Wesley Bryan who’s official world golf ranking is 40th in the world despite his sub $7k price tag. Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place.
11935	11935	55	55	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He suffered a dip in form, following his win in Hawaii, finishing T42 at the CareerBuilder, T31 in Phoenix and missing the cut at the Honda but has hopefully put that behind him now. A T12 finish in Mexico last time out, following a closing round of 66 was a welcome return to form for Kizzire and he will look to put his strengths to good use this week. Kizzire ranks 11th in Par 5 Scoring Average and T19 in SG: Putting this season, and ranked similarly in Mexico.
2927	2927	50	50	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course has undergone regular changes in recent times and Palmer's aim was for it to play like a US Open course from the tee but like a Masters on and around the greens. As a US Open winner with a superb record at Augusta National, it's fairly logical while Rose should enjoy it so much. Speaking last year, Rose said: "It reminds me of the Memorial which happens to be Jack's tournament.
6487	6487	70	70	target: Reed. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson has not played the event since 2013 and failed to make the cut in all three goes but needs to get going again somewhere following a short break and we know he likes to play himself into form with competitive rounds as the Open Championship gets closer. He starts as 22/1 chance but I would rather break the mould for once and take some 16/1 about market leader Patrick Reed. Rather like Watson, Reed’s game can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other with some brilliant attacking golf at the US Open immediately followed by error-strewn clumsiness.
8878	8878	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically, Finau is dominating off of the tee recently, a quick glance at our VIP Research Station shows he is right at the top of the field in this regard. On a course with plenty of scoring opportunities, I like Finau’s chances this week. Keegan Bradley – Cash – DK: $9300  Bradley made ten straight cuts to finish the season.
4971	4971	19	19	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has finished no worse than 15th at Colonial in the past three years, winning the event in 2015. Kirk hasn’t missed a cut at this event in his last six starts, and his 68.6 Course Adj Rd Score ranks fourth among golfers with more than one start at this track. Kirk had struggled this season, but he finished 12th in his last time out at THE PLAYERS Championship.
5361	5361	11	11	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year. Brooks Koepka, $10100 – Finishing second, third, and 19th in three Memphis starts is a good track record for anyone, let alone the fourth-highest ranked player in the field. Koepka is plenty long and posted five top-16 finishes over his last seven starts.
6540	6540	7	7	target: Wagner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card. When he is on, he hits greens as well as anyone on tour.
11441	11441	30	31	target: Joost Luiten, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Beyond the names we’ve watched for two months now, there’s a slew of players setting down in North America for the first time in 2018. Euros Ross Fisher, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Joost Luiten, Jorge Campillo and Paul Dunne are in the field. As is Australasian Tour money leader Brett Rumford, along with countrymen Wade Ormsby and Adam Bland.
682	682	6	6	target: Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			as you know, I'm a big Gribble guy. and he's from TEXAS. more later on this. https://t.co/keg5WaDjOx
3210	3210	0	1	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar ($9,000) – A lack of length can be detrimental to some, but it’s virtually never a problem for Kuch. Kuchar has played here sparingly, but outside of one poor finish in 2015, he’s managed two T8 finishes and a runner-up since 2010. He’s the epitome of course management and has been rock solid steady for the vast majority of this year.
2290	2290	11	11	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the wonky pricing, entire cash game lineups are becoming chalk. Rose will be in it on Sunday. Jim Furyk – $6,700  Jim Furyk gave all those who rostered him a heavy dose of pars last week, managing to only score 30 DraftKings points in three rounds before getting MDF’d.
1564	1564	4	4	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@genesisopen Picks Berger 40 Ollie 45 Noren 45 Pieters 45 Chappy 50 Finau 66 Many many DJ parlays/exotics,… https://t.co/EItr2mjfNJ
10346	10346	25	25	target: Streelman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times. Obviously, he wasn't stating an exact number, the idea remains the same as Streelman, he will be very comfortable sleeping in his own bed this week. Has a pair of top 20s in two of his five starts here, so he's still a bit boom-or-bust.
6693	6693	28	28	target: Harman’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Berger’s feasted on these simple courses recently, with a win and a playoff loss in his past two non-US Open events. There’s no reason to fade him here… Harman’s a former champ of this event, with four Top 10s in his past eight starts, and rates out among the best in the field form 125-175 yards. These two with be very chalky picks, so if you want to risk it and go contrarian to gain points on your completion, I suggest Ben Martin, Kelly Kraft, Nick Taylor or David Hearn.
2178	2178	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world. Day doesn’t have the strongest history here (two MCs and a 64th), but the last time he played this event was way back in 2012 and given the layoff I wouldn’t put too much stock in his shaky course history. While he hasn’t shown dominant form yet in 2017, Day put in three great rounds at Pebble and this could easily be the week he puts the hammer down and distances himself from the field.
1379	1379	5	6	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Couldn't leave out @WMPhoenixOpen specialist Hideki Matsuyama at 10/1. The Japanese absolutely loves this course ha… https://t.co/0demzJaYtY
4306	4306	33	33	target: Simpson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dave Tindall is back to preview this week's PGA Tour event in North Carolina...  "A player getting to contest an event where he’s a member can often be a red herring but in Simpson’s case I don’t think it is." Each-way terms: 1/4 odds, 5 places      It's not as difficult a puzzle to solve as last week's Zurich Classic of New Orleans - did anyone, anywhere back Jonas Blixt and Cameron Smith?! - but the switch to a brand new course makes this year's Wells Fargo much trickier than usual.
10594	10594	80	81	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley. Plus, Ian Poulter, Steve Stricker, and Ryan Moore will be making their 2018 PGA debuts.
1574	1574	7	7	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Made 4 bets so far: Ollie 50/1 Hadley 50/1 Moore 66/1 Bryan 150/1 (a sprinkle - will be more of a T20 bet)
6703	6703	6	6	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy early and often! VALUE  Nick Taylor ($7,600) – Feeling generous, are we DK? Taylor has been red hot lately, and the only reason he isn’t priced even higher than this is because his putter tends to let him down from time to time.
5736	5736	1	1	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose - $16,600    The 2016 Masters runner-up has been a world-class ball striker for years, but a below-average putter has limited Rose to just one career major victory. With rain in the forecast throughout the week, Erin Hills’ greens are projected to soften up a bit, lessening the margin between Rose and those who usually maintain a putting advantage. He’s top 10 on Tour in SG: off-the-tee and fifth in par-four scoring, and is priced a whole $1,300 cheaper than Jason Day.
4634	4634	178	178	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
7817	7817	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He hasn’t had a signature win since The Players a few years ago, and I think this could be spot where he breaks through on the WGC stage. Jason Day (DK: $9,400, FD: $8,800)  This is purely a gut call and could blow up in my face, but I’ll be going heavy on Day in GPPs. I have to believe that his ownership will be microscopic and in an 76-man field, we’ll need to take some shots on low owned guys who can legitimately win the event.
6200	6200	14	15	target: Kevin Chappell; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) J.J.

6153	6153	28	29	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			14 in the Power Rankings), Harris English (Sleeper) and Chez Reavie (Draw in the Fantasy Insider). That you've come this far without a mention of two-time Travelers champion Bubba Watson says all that you need to know. Because of an inconsistent 2017 perhaps due to the change in his ball, he sets up as an ironic contrarian at the tournament where he's the all-time earnings leader, but only if you're way back in the pack.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
7768	7768	1	1	target: Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thomas Pieters ($7300): Pieters has had an excellent track record at WGCs, finishing 23rd/14th/5th in his only attempts, and absolutely stripes the ball. That distance will help him make up the few times where he can get wild off the tee, and it’s really on approach where Pieters’ true talents show out. He’s gained 1.6 strokes on approach over his last five PGA events, and has had a bit of a mixed bag in Europe during that time – finishing T13 at the French Open and T14 at the BMW PGA Championship, but also missing the cut at the Irish Open and a mediocre finish at Birkdale given his expectations as a long hitter.
10967	10967	17	17	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still, he missed the cut. Coming into Riviera off a missed cut and in questionable form makes Scott a decent GPP play this week. Since we know most golfers will be playing from the rough this week, I peeked at guys who make birdies from the rough.
11345	11345	9	9	target: Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Playing in a home game, perhaps we'll finally see Ancer ring the bell in terms of reaching his potential. Looking at my Web Rankings of this year's graduates, Ancer ranked 4th of all graduates in strokes gained across all tours in 2017. The top 8 on that list in 2016 all retained their tour cards this season, meaning we should see Ancer pop eventually.
2485	2485	91	91	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's relevant as seventh, or indeed eighth, would be enough to get the place money at 16s if Johnson, Spieth and McIlroy - all World No.1s at some point in very recent times - finished in front of him. The dream outcome would be Garcia finishing solo fourth behind Johnson, Spieth and McIlroy, allowing us to be paid out on him as a full 16/1 winner rather than getting just the place money at 7s if we'd taken him at 28s on the full outright market. It looks highly likely that Sergio will like what he sees in Mexico and there should be much love coming the Spaniard's way from the local fans who he'll be able to converse with in his native tongue.
12784	12784	29	30	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think this week signifies his best chance of winning a Major and, if he doesn't, a top-8 finish is by no means out of the question. Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course.
797	797	5	6	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton Kizzire - $8,500  4. Webb Simpson - $7,800  5. Nick Watney - $7,500  6.
12699	12699	0	1	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9300): Although he fell back in the pack on Sunday in his Masters debut last year, Rahm was very impressive through 54 holes at Augusta, sitting at even par through 54 in what was a very tough week for scoring. For a first-timer, Rahm flashed all the tools necessary to succeed in the years to come, and this year he should sport an even better finish. Since the start of 2018, the feisty Spaniard has amassed four top-25s – including a win at CareerBuilder and a runner-up in the Tournament of Champions – while missing zero cuts in seven events.
1462	1462	1	1	target: @PReedGolf 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @PReedGolf at 40/1 in the #ATTProAm. Reed is slowly rounding into form and should be full of motivation to m… https://t.co/iCEBiiObv4
3028	3028	24	25	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
2062	2062	22	22	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The time off to heal his back has seemed to helped his short game as he ranks 24th in scrambling this season. Rose is always a threat in less than normal conditions and this week is just that. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  We were high on Phil in Phoenix last week and he got it within two strokes of the lead making the turn on Sunday before posting a four-over 40 on the back nine to finish 16th.
7603	7603	9	10	target: Danny Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Danny Lee – $8,000  Danny Lee has WD from the John Deere Classic. These were words most of the DFS Golf community dreaded to see two weeks ago.
1433	1433	7	7	target: Kelly 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How on earth was course specialist Jerry Kelly matched at [300.0] on the exchange? Winner in 2002, Kelly has made the top-20 on 11 of 17 renewals this century, including top-nines in the last three. He's since come down to around [200.0] but still looks massively overpriced.
11670	11670	7	7	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day. In the shorter term though I feel a big week could be in the offing for him at the Valspar.
2401	2401	29	29	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			By setting a lay order to partially cash out should he shorten up in-play, a similar scenario could still yield a profit. Winner of last year's Memorial Tournament, 37-year-old McGirt seems to be perennially under-rated and written off far too quickly by the market. Having contended for three rounds on his penultimate start, odds of [160.0] are surely an over-reaction to missing the following cut at Pebble Beach.
2802	2802	1	2	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
8408	8408	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I love him this week. MID TIER  Matt Kuchar ($8,700) – No matter where he is, no matter what the course demands, Matt Kuchar finds a way. It’s truly incredible.
359	359	48	49	target: Phil Mickelson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi / Emiliano Grillo; 11) Colt Knost / John Huh / Spencer Levin; 14) Kevin Streelman; 15) Jon Curran; 16) Scott Brown / Kevin Na / Kevin Kisner; 19) Russell Knox; 20) Chad Campbell. Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Adam Scott; 4) Phil Mickelson; 5) Emiliano Grillo; 6) Rory McIlroy; 7) Jason Kokrak / Ryan Palmer; 9) Kevin Na; 10) Jhonattan Vegas / Bubba Watson; 12) Jerry Kelly / Russell Knox; 14) Martin Laird / Webb Simpson; 16) Jordan Spieth / Charl Schwartzel; 18) Jason Day / Jason Dufner; 20) Chad Campbell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Kevin Kisner; 2) Jason Day / Patrick Reed; 4) Brooks Koepka; 5) Brandt Snedeker / Bubba Watson; 7) Vijay Singh; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Zach Johnson / Kevin Na; 11) Kevin Chappell / David Lingmerth / Phil Mickelson; 14) Billy Hurley III; 15) Daniel Berger / Scott Brown / Ryan Palmer / Charl Schwartzel; 19) Si Woo Kim / Russell Knox.
2862	2862	18	19	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you want to go contrarian, Graeme McDowell is the guy in this group. Hideki Matsyuama, Justin Rose, Paul Casey, & Kevin Kisner – Don’t worry about Hideki’s recent struggles, his ball striking and short game are still elite, which is necessary at Bay Hill… Rose has four Top 15s in his last five trips to Orlando along with three Top 5 finishes in his past five overall. As a bonus, he’s second in the field from the key Par 3 Range, trailing only Martin Kaymer… Casey has just been playing too well to not pop at some point.
1688	1688	20	20	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
11774	11774	11	11	target: Wise, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That leaves plenty of room for boom-or-bust options at the bottom. Wise, Hossler, and Burns are all youngsters with top-10 potential while Woods is just too cheap still. Editor’s Note : With over 15,000 reviews, DRAFT is the highest rated fantasy sports app.
3633	3633	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price suckered me in. Paul Casey 40% – Speaking of way too cheap. Here we have Paul Casey.
12862	12862	30	31	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose rates out near the top of every single stat, has nine top 10s in his past 11 starts, and has gone P2/T10/T2/T14 the last four years at Augusta National. Adam Scott  The 2013 Masters champ took most of the first two months off from competitive play, and since his return at Pebble Beach, the results have been rather middling — MC/T53/T13/T16/T41. Guess why?
10088	10088	26	27	target: Ben Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His birdie or better rank is right in the middle, but he’s coming off a performance at Kapalua where he dropped 20 birdies for the week. Ben Martin ($6,900) – Ben Martin is my sleeper pick for the week, although, some other DFS players may be on to him after his T 7 finish last week in the Sony Open. Martin has shot in the 60s for seven straight competitive rounds; nothing to sneeze at regardless of the course difficulty.
6001	6001	7	8	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			COMING IN HOT : RECENT FORM  1. Paul Casey, $9,700  I highlighted Casey in the “Coming in Hot” portion of this article last week and he stayed scorching early in the U.S. Open with a 66-71 Thursday-Friday. A 75-74 weekend left him with a 26th-place finish, but it’s still 11 straight made cuts for the Englishman.
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
11429	11429	32	32	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played in this tournament last year, and if it weren’t for an opening round 76, his T55 finish would look much, much better. What is different from last year, is that Noren was not playing nearly as much as he has been in 2018, making his results from last year tough to compare. I’m all in and Noren is a lock for cash.
1674	1674	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016. For a player who hits it as long as Woodland, his ranking of 59th in scrambling is very underrated.
7784	7784	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s arguably the world’s best off the tee on a course that rewards long and accurate driving. Rickie Fowler, $9000 – Fowler has showed a knack for Firestone with four top-10 finishes in just seven career starts. Since June, Fowler has racked up three top-5 finishes and a 22nd at the Open two weeks back.
1647	1647	33	34	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Dustin Johnson ($11.1m); 2: Jason Day ($11.4m); 3: Jimmy Walker ($9.4m); 4: Brandt Snedeker ($9.5m); 5: Phil Mickelson ($10.0m); 6: Charles Howell III ($7.3m); 7: Gary Woodland ($8.6m); 8: Justin Rose ($10.2m); 9: Rickie Fowler ($9.7m); 10: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.2m). Predictor Positives : Dustin Johnson is cheaper than both Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama this week and I would take him in this 2017 renewal.
8505	8505	49	49	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To recover from a 77 with a closing 70 to finish T9 was a fair effort and that top 10 built on previous finishes of T24 (WGC-Bridgestone) and T27 (Open Championship) so he's clearly coming back to life after a dip. Talking at Quail Hollow after a second-round 66, Day explained: "There were signs coming from Royal Birkdale; there were signs coming from last week in Akron. Being able to piece it together is difficult, because the driving and the putting has been lagging behind.
2757	2757	24	24	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row. Not only can Haas dominate the Par 3’s, he is also top 20 in SG: Tee to Green.
9151	9151	3	4	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Chesson Hadley ($10,100)  Many casual golf fans still don’t know the name Chesson Hadley, but they should. Coming off a multi-win season on the web.com Tour, Hadley stormed to a runner-up finish at last week’s Sanderson Farms. Because he’s had PGA Tour status before, he’s played TPC Summerlin numerous times.
11763	11763	47	48	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top 5 Finishes So Far This Season  1st – Aaron Wise – $8,800 – Byron Nelson – Week 20  1st – Jason Day – $9,400 – Farmers Insurance – Week 4  1st – Bubba Watson – $8,200 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  2nd – Patrick Reed – $7,700 – Valspar Championship – Week 10  2nd – Chez Reavie – $8,000 – AT&T – Week 6  2nd – Adrian Otaugui – $7,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Lucas Herbert – $7,100 – Rocco Forte Open – Week 19  3rd – Brandon Steele – $7,800 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  3rd – Alex Noren – $8,700 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  3rd – Jorge Campillo – $8,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Emiliano Grillo – $8,600 – Fort Worth Invitational – Week 21  4th – Seungsu Han – $7500 – Oman Open – Week 7  5th – Chris Paisley – $7,400 – Dubai Desert Classic – Week 4  5th – Phil Mickelson – $8,700 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  5th – Seungsu Han – $8,500 – Corales Puntacana Championship – Week 12  5th – Webb Simpson – $9,400 – RBC Heritage – Week 15  5th – Jorge Campillo – $8,500 – Espana De Open – Week 15  5th – Phil Mickelson – $9,200 – Wells Fargo – Week 18  Euro Tour Picks sponsored by Golf Predictor – for all your DFS stats for both the European & US PGA Tours.

13389	13389	5	5	target: Ancer, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nothing stands out statistically for Ancer, but his all-round game is clearly in solid shape right now and his recent experiences and form will certainly help him here. Ancer ranked 4th at the Valspar and 30th at the Houston Open in Par 5 Scoring Average for the week, and if he performs on the “scoring holes” as well as he did at the Valspar, here this week, his chances will look all the better come Sunday. He did play here back in 2016, making the weekend and eventually finishing T42 but he will be hoping for a much better showing this time around.
204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
3576	3576	38	39	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hudson Swafford and Jon Rahm registered on the West Coast Swing claiming the CareerBuilder Challenge and Farmers Insurance Open before Canadian Adam Hadwin broke into the winner's circle with victory at the Valspar Championship in Florida. In Europe, Tommy Fleetwood won the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship before a runner-up finish to Dustin Johnson at the WGC-Mexico Championship which guaranteed his ticket to Augusta. South Korean Jeunghun Wang landed the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters to make it three European Tour titles since May 2016.
11576	11576	36	36	target: Fisher 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 27th-ranked player in the OWGR posted a T3 result at the WGC-Mexico Championship last year when he finished top-five among the field in both GIR percentage and SG: Putting. Throughout the Euro Tour’s 2017 season, Fisher ranked fourth in GIR percentage and ended sixth in the Race to Dubai. Bargain Bin    Kevin Chappell - $14,100    Not a bad price for someone who ranks fourth on Tour in SG: Tee-to-Green and 10th in scrambling, but he’ll need to improve with the flat stick in order to have any shot at winning this week.
2254	2254	26	26	target: Johnson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th. Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No.
168	168	6	6	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
8773	8773	14	15	target: Jordan Spieth: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Rory McIlroy: 42nd BMW/1st Deutsche/31st Barclays/MC PGA. Jordan Spieth: 13th BMW/MC Deutsche/MC Barclays/2nd PGA. Billy Horschel: 1st BMW/2nd Deutsche/MC Barclays/47th Wyndham.
8610	8610	70	71	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This section is going to detail a few of the golfers who have the best fantasy value compared to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Marc Leishman 66-1 $6,900 Tony Finau 7,100 and 80-1  Russell Knox $7,100 and 125-1  Emiliano Grillo $6,900 and 175-1 Adam Scott 34-1 $7,900 Gary Woodland $8,000 and 100-1  Webb Simpson $8,200 and 55-1  Charley Hoffman $8,300 and 50-1  Course Horses  Phil Mickelson loves being aggressive, and this course has suited him well in the past. Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and also has a 10th and fourth in his past six visits.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
5639	5639	0	1	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8,800): Scott has been up and down ever since the Masters but his recent finish at the FedEx St. Jude suggests a man whose long game might be finally peaking. Scott was top five in SG: approaches and tee to green in Memphis and has actually been putting better than his career averages recently too. For DFS, he’s well under priced at just $8,800 and probably a better play from a pure value perspective than anyone in the 9k range.
6235	6235	6	6	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10200 – The world’s ninth-ranked player heads the field and represents a good value after a week of rest following his recent top-5 finish at the U.S. Open. Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form.
7192	7192	0	1	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia may have a Green Jacket in his closet, but this is the major championship he’s been the best at over his career. Dating back to 2005, Garcia has seven finishes of ninth or better at the Open, including a heartbreaking playoff loss to Paddy Harrington in 2007. Marc Leishman is a bit of a late bloomer to links golf, but his record over the past few Opens is worth noting.
217	217	3	3	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Reed, Knox &amp; Simpson in Phoenix this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
12041	12041	60	61	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Strategy Tips for this week (based on 60k standard salary cap)    Well-rounded players who are solid off the tee with great irons excel at Bay Hill, but there’s also a chance a few elite putters find themselves in contention as well. As such, focus your efforts on securing great ball strikers who have shown flashes of good putting recently (*cough* Jason Day - Justin Rose - Tiger Woods *cough*) and blend in others who have proven history at the King’s place. The eventual winner is going to need to drive it well and score on the par-5s to have any chance, so make sure you fill your lineup with players who have a good chance of doing just that.
8142	8142	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another guy to watch on Fanshare, but I can’t see him above 25% with all the names above him. Rickie Fowler $10,700 – He has a win at Quail in 2012 and a 4th in 2016. I think he figured something out last week after a bit of a letdown at The Open.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
12221	12221	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
8319	8319	25	25	target: Reavie’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie’s success has been coming from his Approach game, where he has been gaining just under a stroke a round once field adjusted. I like Reavie’s affordable price tag and see the ownership low enough to be playable in GPP’s well the floor is high enough he makes a great cash game play. Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago.
2036	2036	20	21	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the weather is truly as bad as it looks, I also like Brandt to contend more than others. Tom:  Justin Rose $9,200 – Rosey has teed it up twice in the States in 2017, and twice finished in the top 5. When players of his caliber do this, it is best to just ride the hot hand.
6366	6366	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think his top-five finish in a major gave him a huge confidence boost and helped him realize he belongs atop the leaderboard. Props  Rickie Fowler & Justin Thomas (+400) vs. the Field (-650): I’ll take these odds all day. I’ve got Rickie pegged as the winner alone; add in Justin Thomas, and it’s a pretty safe play.
12699	12699	1	1	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9300): Although he fell back in the pack on Sunday in his Masters debut last year, Rahm was very impressive through 54 holes at Augusta, sitting at even par through 54 in what was a very tough week for scoring. For a first-timer, Rahm flashed all the tools necessary to succeed in the years to come, and this year he should sport an even better finish. Since the start of 2018, the feisty Spaniard has amassed four top-25s – including a win at CareerBuilder and a runner-up in the Tournament of Champions – while missing zero cuts in seven events.
4623	4623	20	20	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A second-round 64 on debut suggests he has the capability to go low around this course, especially if in form. Finau got into contention once again recently, at the Valero Texas Open, three starts after finishing 5th at the Valspar Championship. Given his current form and the fact he ranks 4th in Greens in Regulation and T4 in Par 4 Performance so far this season, there is every reason to be optimistic about his chances this week.
12439	12439	49	50	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MATT’S CINDERELLAS  Dylan Frittelli ($6,900), 41 seed, Group 7  His familiarity with the course/area and potential road to the quarterfinals make him interesting to me. Group 10 doesn’t scare me at all which means you could get at least 5 rounds out of him before his inevitable loss to Justin Thomas. Group 7 is ripe for the picking, and I think whoever makes it out moves on at least one more round.
7416	7416	38	39	target: Ollie Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey. RESULT: T62  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  We were on board Ollie Schniederjans as recently as Old White TPC and despite a very strange WD there for a scoring card signing infringement, I'm still very much of the opinion that Ollie is a player to watch right now. His last performance at the John Deere Classic was far better as he co-led after shooting a flawless -8/63 on Thursday and backed that up with a -5/66 to get back in contention.
12032	12032	41	42	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Though Arnold isn’t physically present, his legend lives on in what should be another fantastic close to the Florida Swing. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Marc Leishman  2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Matt Every  2014 – Matt Every  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Martin Laird  2010 – Ernie Els  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Tiger Woods    Key Stats to Winning this Week    • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green  • Strokes Gained Putting  • Par-5 Scoring    Champion’s Profile    As a longer track with some penalizing rough, it’s a must for players to drive the ball well, both long and straight. The length becomes a nice advantage on the reachable par-5 holes and longer par-4s that prove demanding over four rounds.
93	93	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sleeper of the Week  Our weekly pick for you is one that you may not expect. Graham DeLaet: He scored a top 5 here in 2012 and was 20th in the Olympics a few weeks ago. He also posted a top 10 in July, so he is close.
326	326	21	22	target: Emiliano Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statswise Snedeker ranks 19th in SG around the green, 35th in SGP, 20th in scrambling and first in par 4 scoring. Emiliano Grillo 50/1  The young Argentinian has been very impressive this season on The PGA Tour. He recorded his first PGA Tour win at The Frys.com Open last October and hasn’t really put a foot wrong since.
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
1288	1288	13	13	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open picks: Winner: TIGER! Just kidding... Leishman Top 10: Finau, Howell, Steele DK Sleepers: L… https://t.co/JMY4XPGdcM
3721	3721	9	9	target: Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun. As Kisner took Jim Furyk all the way having never before had a serious chance to win at this level, what his coach said suddenly made sense.
3374	3374	9	9	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He clearly loves Magnolia Lane. Vegas Odds  Since 2014, Spieth has played in about as many tournaments with odds to win of at least 10 percent as he has with odds of less than 10 percent. Unsurprisingly, he has excelled as a double-digit Vegas favorite:  Conversely, Spieth has exceeded his salary-based expectations in just 20 of 39 tournaments when playing with odds to win of less than 10 percent.
2850	2850	47	47	target: Hadwin’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he has improved with his irons approaching the green this season, ranking 59th in GIR percentage at 70%, compared to his 66.2% average GIR over his last two seasons. I hate rostering a player with bad course history, but in this case I really do think Hadwin’s current form outweighs any worries I have about him here at Copperhead. At $6,800, we are getting one of the most consentient players on The Tour this season at a serious discount in a very weak field.
7240	7240	10	11	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance. Even if you doubt his ability to win, there's an awful lot of each-way juice in that price with eight each-way places.
2184	2184	25	25	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott will likely be my one-and-done pick this week as he has gone T-2, T-10 and T-17 in last three tries at Riviera. If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk.
11901	11901	26	27	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			282 yards (48th), 60.7% fairways (51st), 72.2% greens in regulation (7th), 33'8" proximity to hole (11th), 60.0 % scrambling (34th), 1.65 putts per GIR (3rd). 2013, Tiger Woods (-13). 279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st).
12059	12059	26	26	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season. Of his eight PGA events, Grillo has two top-10s, including at a very tough Honda Classic in which he finished T8. Grillo performs well on tough courses, can play in the wind and is a very strong second-shot golfer.
11066	11066	11	12	target: Harris English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No doubt that still leaves him an appetite for revenge here. Harris English is your Driver-off-the-Deck BOLD play of the week! #isitThursdayyet  Joel Harrington  @joel4deepgolf
3090	3090	2	3	target: Ben Crane 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jeff Bergerson: Ben Crane ($6,500) on DraftKings  In weaker fields like this week's Puerto Rico Open, I love looking at our Sportsbook Odds vs. Daily Pricing Tool on our site to help me find the best value plays. One of those great values that is revealed is Ben Crane at $6,800. He has made the cut in his past four tournaments with much stonger fields.
6104	6104	65	66	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For tournaments, I will be looking to build around a core the same core for the most part but also using some contrarian plays that could be lower owned with similar upside. The Course  TPC River Highlands - Cromwell, CT  Par 70 - 6,841 Yards  Greens - Bentgrass  **Click to Enlarge**  Past Five Winners  2016 - Russell Knox (-14)  - Russell Knox (-14) 2015 - Bubba Watson (-16)  - Bubba Watson (-16) 2014 - Kevin Streelman (-15)  - Kevin Streelman (-15) 2013 - Ken Duke (-12)  - Ken Duke (-12) 2012 - Marc Leishman (-14)  The Stats & Fantasy Approach  My Key Stats:  Strokes Gained: Off the Tee + Approach  Par 4 Scoring Average  Greens in Regulation from 100-150 Yards  Birdie or Better %  Other Stats I am looking at - Bogey Avoidance, Strokes Gained Putting  I will also be factoring in players who do well on Par 70 courses and Pete Dye designed courses. This information can be found be visiting the Future of Fantasy's Golfanac.
826	826	12	12	target: GAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
1081	1081	13	13	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Chapman - Sony Open - 2ew Kisner 25-1; 1ew S W Kim 60-1, Henley 40-1, Swafford 90-1; 0.5ew J Walker 100-1, Leishman 16-1
299	299	2	2	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Jordan Spieth -- Something is just a little off about Spieth's game right now, but it's still good enough to finish in the top 15 most weeks. 5.
5342	5342	25	26	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's won once from 66 PGA Tour starts and he makes no appeal at around [14.0]. Regular readers will know that I'm not a huge Adam Scott fan (betting wise) and that I very rarely back him but he's the stand out for me at the head of the market here. In his sole appearance here to date, 10 years ago, he led by three with a round to go but finished seventh so we know the course suits his eye but so it should.
8355	8355	1	1	target: Blaum 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ryan Blaum - $6,900 (Field, 8-5)    The 33-year-old rookie is well inside the top-125, and is even nearing the top-100, which would get him into a second playoff event. Blaum has made five straight cuts, two of them top-10s, and has missed only six cuts all season. He's 25th in strokes gained putting.
222	222	5	5	target: Streb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
727	727	3	4	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson. In three years, he has two top 10s here at Sheshan Golf Club, including a win in 2014.
4911	4911	55	56	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Colonial CC is often affectionately referred to as 'Hogan's Alley' after the five-time winner Ben. Weather Forecast      TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Jordan Spieth -17  2015 - Chris Kirk -12  2014 - Adam Scott -9 (Playoff)  2013 - Boo Weekley -14  2012 - Zach Johnson -12      What Will it Take to Win the Dean & Deluca Invitational? Colonial is short by modern standards and Driving Distance is an irrelevant stat, with irons being taken on many tees.
9441	9441	19	19	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also gained more than a stroke around-the-green in nine starts last year. With a resort layout from tee-to-green, Bryan should be able to reach the green with relative ease and then let his short game to all the talking. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($10,900): He's been inside the top 3 after nine of his 12 rounds at Kapalua.
6386	6386	10	10	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TPC Potomac features six par 4s of 450-500 yards, which Fowler has performed well on this year (8th in Birdie or Better in that range). It’s extremely difficult to fade Fowler given his play this season. Justin Thomas ($10,900) is the third most expensive golfer and comes in off of a missed cut at the Travelers Championship.
1199	1199	95	96	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Jim Herman; 3) Brian Stuard; 4) James Hahn / Russell Knox / Brendan Steele; 7) William McGirt; 8) Hideki Matsuyama / Bubba Watson; 10) Billy Hurley III; 11) Si Woo Kim; 12) Jhonattan Vegas. Greens in Regulation : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Russell Knox; 3) Brendan Steele; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Branden Grace / Bubba Watson; 8) Justin Thomas / Jhonattan Vegas; 10) Daniel Berger; 11) William McGirt; 12) Ryan Moore. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Pat Perez; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Ryan Moore; 5) Russell Knox; 6) Patrick Reed; 7) Dustin Johnson; 8) Daniel Berger; 9) Brandt Snedeker; 10) Cody Gribble; 11) Si Woo Kim; 16) Branden Grace.
1249	1249	65	66	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
792	792	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Jimmy Walker -- The PGA champion has a strong TPC Summerlin record, with three top-15 finishes in the last five years. There's a reason MGM sponsors the guy; he shows up in Vegas.
10096	10096	38	39	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He sits in the top quarter on Tour in all the key stats for the week (strokes gained: approach, Par 5 scoring, birdie or better %), and is now using these events to get ready for The Masters. Austin Cook ($8,700) – The early frontrunner for rookie of the year, Austin Cook has more than that on his mind. Cook has come out on fire to start his PGA Tour career.
2851	2851	1	2	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Bill Haas - Haas was outclassed in Mexico, but he's otherwise been great this season. This is a good track for him, and he should have won here last year.
9004	9004	11	12	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Purse: $7 million; $1.26 million (winner); 500 FEC points. Defending Champion: Justin Thomas defended his championship as he defeated Hideki Matsuyama by three shots. Notes: 78 players; 72 holes (no cut).
8090	8090	19	20	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My shortlist was massive this week although very few really struck me as potential winners. Of those that did, Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel were the most notable within our price range. Both have majors pedigree, excellent Florida records and are long off the tee.
2192	2192	33	34	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
9101	9101	22	22	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T2nd  Alexander Levy 0.5pt EW 125/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Jordan L Smith 0.5pt EW 200/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get a £10 free bet. 18+, T&Cs apply:  With 2 decent punts on a couple of the short-priced players, I'll finish with a couple of longshots.
1209	1209	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he'll have hit the reset button since placing 10th in Tiger's tournament and he's definitely worth following in this event. Hopefully, this is the best market for us to fully cash in and it's worth pointing out that with four payout places, Reed could finish eighth in the tournament and we'd still edge a profit on him. With the front of the betting so strong, it's hard to find much space for any bigger-priced players.
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
5576	5576	10	10	target: Fowler’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite. A missed cut at the FedEx St Jude Classic aside – more on that shortly – Fowler might just have the most complete profile currently and is well capable of putting himself in position for victory once more. His latest opportunity to land himself a major came at the Masters in April and although perfectly poised after three rounds, it didn’t happen for the Californian as he drifted away to a T11 with a closing 76.
6044	6044	26	27	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, instead of targeting year-long stats, I’m focusing on rolling stats from the past five weeks. Looking at this data, the field leaders in SG:APP are Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey, Daniel Berger, Mark Hubbard, Marc Leishman, Byeong-Hun An, David Lingmerth, and Scott Piercy. Strokes Gained Putting (SG:P): I don’t typically target putting stats, but I think putting will be huge this week because everyone in the field should be hitting fairways and greens.
4530	4530	2	2	target: Johnson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That said, Johnson’s heavy 12.5 percent odds to win are currently the best in the field. Newlywed Swag  Unlike Johnson, the newly-married Rory McIlroy has thrived in recent trips to TPC Sawgrass. In fact, McIlroy’s 68.2 Course Adjusted Round Score is the fifth-best score among golfers who have made more than one start at this course.
4100	4100	6	7	target: Kevin Chappell. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tied for seventh at the Masters. Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
9716	9716	1	1	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week. Thomas for a second-straight week will serve as defending champion, but don’t let last week’s performance scare you away. Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week.
1863	1863	27	27	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In those four starts he has two missed cuts, but when he has made the weekend has looked fairly good. At the Shriners Hopsitals for Children Open, Jones shot four sub-70 rounds, including an opening-round 65 to finish T15. Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back.
12199	12199	51	52	target: Rickie Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion.
7928	7928	43	43	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie enters the week as the 11th-ranked golfer in the world and is coming off three solid weeks – Bridgestone is still pending so it’s excluded – with finishes of T22, T3, and T5 before his last missed cut at the St. Jude. Fowler also finished T11 at Augusta, and although he’s yet to win a major his track record with high finishes in majors combined with his track record at Quail Hollow are positive signs. In the last six years at this course, the diminutive candidate for BPTNWAM has won (2012), made the cut with mediocre finishes twice, and finished T4 last year.
8312	8312	20	20	target: Li 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I would expect more of the same this week in a weak field event where Campbell is reasonably priced. Hao-Tang Li – GPP – DK: $7400 FD: $6900  Li has sprung together quite the season and I will continue to be on him well he remains underpriced and relatively unknown. Across the European, Tour Li has sprung up inside of the top 10 four times in sixteen starts, pretty impressive.
8466	8466	40	41	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And once more, he's right on the bubble when it comes to qualifying for a team event - this time the Presidents Cup, in which he was disappointing two years ago and will doubtless therefore be keen to make amends. Patrick Reed  You know as well as I do that he'll be selected as a wild card regardless, but that was also the case a year ago yet the Texan wanted to take care of business for himself. There's absolutely no doubt that his sensational performance at Hazeltine, capped by that Sunday singles win over McIlroy, can be traced back to the way he hauled himself over the line at Bethpage.
5479	5479	7	7	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look for the same result this time. Spieth will finish eight under. DJ is the best player in the game right now, and he wins at all kinds of courses, but he'll finish seven under.
11224	11224	23	23	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At only $7,700 this week, I like his value for cash games, but also like his upside for GPPs. -- Jeff Bergerson  Bud Cauley  Cauley's been an excellent value play this season, with two top-10 finishes (RSM Classic and Safeway Open), and only one missed cut in eight events played. He's only played this course three times in his career, missing the cut in both 2012 and 2013, but finishing T27 last year.
4280	4280	30	30	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
1730	1730	5	6	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter. Winners & Prices : 2017: Matsuyama 11/1 ; 2016: Matsuyama 25/1 ; 2015: Koepka 40/1 ; 2014: Stadler 125/1 ; 2013: Mickelson 25/1 ; 2012: Stanley 66/1 ; 2011: Wilson 80/1 ; 2010: Mahan 66/1 ; Average: 53/1.
8010	8010	27	27	target: Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That first round was a tough one for him in his debut in the Wells Fargo, but he played well throughout the rest of the week. Like Holmes, Finau has played pretty well of late. He was fifth in the RBC Canadian Open and seventh in the Greenbrier Classic.
4788	4788	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All those sub-par rounds have translated into T10 on debut in 2010 and T12 last year. I always like Finau on a windy track and that's the deal this week. He won the Puerto Rico Open last year in really blustery conditions and fired a 65 in round two of the Texas Open when it blew over 20mph.
3358	3358	29	29	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to our Trends tool, golfers with a LT DD of at least 305 yards have generated a +7.81 Plus/Minus at Augusta National. Like Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Johnson has a top-three LT Adjusted Birdie Average in the field. Spieth: Masters Report  In fact, Johnson’s 17.2 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is second to only Rory McIlroy, which enhances DJ’s value in the DraftKings scoring system.
9701	9701	30	30	target: Reavie’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie finished last season strong with six straight top 25’s and has shown decent course history with three straight made cuts including a top 10 last season. The course fits Reavie’s game as his lack of distance off of the tee won’t hurt him as much as it would on other layouts. According to our Research Station, Reavie is number 1 in field adjusted driving accuracy of any player priced over $9000 on FanDuel.
6885	6885	39	40	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They're getting long in the tooth now and Zach, in-particular, is struggling form wise but I thought they were worth small savers at around [30.0] and I also like the defending champ and this year's Heritage winner, Wesley Bryan. Ryan Moore hasn't played for five weeks because of a strained tendon in his left shoulder so there's a danger he's rushing back to make his defence. That's the only reason I can see for his price of [42.0] but if you flip that on its head, maybe he's waited to get back in A1 condition to put up a bold defence on a course he clearly loves?
4321	4321	66	66	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MacKenzie now lives in Jupiter, Florida, but the others have stayed put or moved to South Carolina or nearby Georgia (Love). Jason Kokrak is a Charlotte resident and others that now reside in the state include rank outsiders, Brad Fritsch, Chad Collins and Johnson Wagner but the three players in the field that require particular attention are frequent course visitor, Bill Haas, and Eagle Point members Webb Simpson and Carl Pettersson...  Simpson, who was born here, went to college here and who still lives here, tweeted back in March "I learned to play golf at Eagle Point. It'll be pretty special to play a PGA Tour event there in May.
816	816	19	20	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick to Click: DJ was awful last week; I’ll do much better this week. Winners picked this year: 1  Brooks Koepka – $10,700 Out of alt he guys priced 10k and above, he’s the only one I’d play at a high clip. Chris Kirk is playing very well right now, but I think Koepka is going to win, and soon, and it might be in Vegas this week.
11370	11370	40	41	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a plethora of players vying for a place in the six-man line-up for the official European Tour fantasy game and the addition of some top Americans, who are now eligible, adds to the difficulty for gamers. Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood will surely be a staple of most line-ups given their exploits here last year while Dutchman Joost Luiten could be a big-value outsider to cause a few waves. One To Swerve  Tyrrell Hatton’s T10 last year may have been based on the fact he was in fantastic form rather than loved the course.
13149	13149	15	15	target: Ryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A player who's traditionally gone from Augusta direct to Quail Hollow in terms of schedule, Ryan now finds himself outside of the OWGR top 50 and needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Open. So the tight, Carolina course set-up at Harbour Town clearly appeals to Moore who hasn't visited these South Carolina shores since 2008 (he missed the cut, then finished 2nd at the Byron Nelson a week later). Logically though the test this week at Harbour Town should suit him down the ground.
1251	1251	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What is going on with Charley Hoffman’s DraftKings salary this week? He’s the 9th top-ranked golfer in the field, t… https://t.co/2ETp8RsST8
8821	8821	6	6	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest. So much is about momentum at this time of year and while plenty of the field are going the wrong way, the Englishman is coming on strong.
12810	12810	14	15	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			AUGUSTA, Georgia — Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo is buying into the hype, saying Tiger Woods will “threaten” in his quest for a 15th major championship this week. Woods is on a mission to add to his 79 PGA TOUR victories and 14 majors, returning to Augusta National for the first time in a playing capacity since a T17 finish in 2015. Woods has already collected the green jacket four times, but not since 2005.
5074	5074	62	62	target: Fleetwood’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His SG: Tee to Green would put him second after only Dustin Johnson if he had enough qualified rounds, and his 0.843 SG: Approach would have him sixth – it is a small tracked sample, but those numbers combined with his results on the European Tour show that this Brit is no fluke. The approach numbers are the most tantalizing aspect of Fleetwood’s game for this course, and although his PGA GIR% of 61.51% doesn’t jump out as anything special, he’s currently ranked 2nd in that category across the pond (82.6%, although the Euro Tour average is higher overall than the PGA’s, at 68.7%). Fleetwood’s scrambling also leaves something to be desired, but a large part of that has come not from the wedge but from poor putting.
4976	4976	42	43	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall. Duf Daddy has two runner-up finishes at Colonial (2012 and 2014) and finished sixth last year.
3652	3652	17	17	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have to take the chalk in this group (Kuchar/Snedeker/Furyk), Kuch is the best bet. Tyrrell Hatton & Jason Dufner – As with Grace last year, the missed cut for Hatton at Augusta may actually work in his favor. Expectations have been lowered and he got the extra two days of downtime.
1099	1099	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: B Gay 125/1, B Stuard 125/1, W Kim 250/1, C Campbell 250/1, M Hoffmann 250/1, C Conners 300/1
12219	12219	71	71	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This year he has been drawn in a group with his Ryder Cup buddy Jordan Spieth, Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel. As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through.
4771	4771	26	26	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was T24 two weeks at the Wells Fargo and shot a bogey-free 4 under to finish there, one of the best rounds of the day. Schauffele also seems to set up well for this week’s course stylistically too, as he ranks second in efficiency scoring on 450-500-yard par 4s and 30th overall in Par 4 Scoring. If you include the team event, Schauffele has actually finished 30th or better in three of his last four starts on tour and could excel this week on a venue that has been kind to first-timers.
1185	1185	12	12	target: Pan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Palmer - CareerBuilder - 2.5ew Simpson 25-1; 1ew C-T Pan 200-1; 0.5pt ew McNealy 275-1 #CareerBuilderChallenge
8222	8222	29	29	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They've changed number five which was an awkward tee-shot which required a draw which I'm glad I don't have to play anymore." With less hype surrounding him this week, Rahm could really fly. Last four events: 28-44-1-10  Quail Hollow record: Debut  US PGA record: Debut  Last 10 majors: 44-MC-27-59-23  Last 50 starts - Win: 6%, Top 5: 31%, Top 10: 40%      Brooks Koepka    If Spieth has been king of the majors in the last few seasons, Koepka has probably been prince.
578	578	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will. He’s long enough to suit this course and with 9 consecutive tournaments of being under par, Reed has the scoring ability to win everything come Sunday.
818	818	13	13	target: Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like that form to continue this week. o P/PR= 88  • Cody Gribble – $8.400 Fresh of his first PGA Tour victory, Gribble’s masterful Sunday propelled him to full tour status for the next 2 years. I’m sure that will have a great effect on him, and I expect to see him around a lot this year.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
4333	4333	1	1	target: Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Watney ... Not that there was ever a doubt, but he’s playing with a new lease on status, so to speak. For finishing among the throng at T5 (with partner Charley Hoffman) at TPC Louisiana, Watney met the terms of his Major Medical Extension by $3,091. He still had 10 starts to burn and wasn’t in danger of reduced playing time, but it was a nice way to celebrate his 36th birthday (April 25).
13357	13357	125	126	target: Xander Schauffele; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) Ryan Armour; 3) Jim Furyk / Shubhankar Sharma; 5) Chad Campbell / Sergio Garcia; 7) Keegan Bradley; 8) David Hearn; 9) Michael Thompson; 10) Vaughn Taylor; 11) Martin Laird; 12) Chris Kirk / Kevin Na; 14) Fabian Gomez; 15) Andrew Landry; 16) Kevin Streelman / Andrew Yun; 18) Russell Knox; 19) Alex Cejka / Billy Horschel / Pat Perez / Jonathan Randolph. Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Sergio Garcia; 3) Trey Mullinax; 4) Luke List; 5) Tom Lovelady / Brendan Steele; 7) Keegan Bradley; 8) Charley Hoffman / Xander Schauffele; 10) Michael Thompson; 11) Scott Piercy / Adam Schenk; 13) Jason Kokrak / J.T. Poston; 15) Bronson Burgoon; 16) Denny McCarthy / Nick Watney; 18) Ryan Moore; 19) Stewart Cink / Corey Conners / Pat Perez.
11523	11523	17	18	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The second WGC of the 2017-18 season also presents career-changing potential for non-members. In last year's edition, Tommy Fleetwood, Ross Fisher, Thomas Pieters and Tyrrell Hatton recorded top 10s in Mexico City. Each would go on to total enough non-member FedExCup points to secure fully exempt status this season.
10053	10053	3	3	target: Kirk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox! He has form a plenty on Pete Dye courses and I’m not at all surprised to see him now adding this event back on to his schedule after missing it the last two years.
12943	12943	24	24	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In relation to SGTTG the last six winners have all entered Masters week ranked inside the top 7 in this stat on the season. Casey currently sits second on the season. He also ranks eighth in SGATG.
5218	5218	20	20	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
8343	8343	60	61	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed’s brother lying down Spiderman-style) and overall skill with the putter is crucial. STATS  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-the-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Par-4 Birdie or Better %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Scrambling %  Driving Accuracy %  The Golfers  Kevin Kisner ($11300) – After an excellent performance just a few short miles from Sedgefield at Quail Hollow, Kisner enters this week as the second-highest priced golfer thanks to Henrik Stenson needing his 15 PGA events, and Kisner’s price is well-deserved. The South Carolina native is a Bermuda-grass stud with excellent course history here, making the cut all four times he’s played the event while picking up two top-10s his last two attempts.
1031	1031	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
4240	4240	39	40	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Masters link might be worth exploring, though. Marsh Benson, formerly the senior course director at Augusta before retiring, was brought in as a consultant on this project and that, combined with those Augusta mentions, is enough to support Bill Haas at 40/1. Haas might be another who relishes the move away from Quail Hollow, even if he perhaps wouldn't admit it, because his record there had grown stale.
9539	9539	30	31	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But with such a small, no-cut field, it's certainly possible for a first-timer to secure a high finish. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Justin Thomas - $11,100 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 6-1)    If there's one course all season that rewards aggressiveness, it's Kapalua. As we learned last season, Thomas thrives on courses that aren't too penal off the tee.
11902	11902	25	26	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st). 2012, Tiger Woods (-13). 295 yards (11th), 64.3% fairways (29th), 79.2% greens in regulation (1st), 36'4" proximity to hole (20th), 60.0% scrambling (10th), 1.84 putts per GIR (52nd).
11649	11649	39	39	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace lost strokes on his approaches in Mexico for the first time all season, yet he continued his season-long trend of saving pars from missed GIRs. If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament.
16	16	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
3986	3986	29	29	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On top of the stats, Horschel has some excellent course history including two straight Top 5 finishes and three in his last four trips to the Oaks Course. With Hadwin and Donald likely commanding a ton of ownership, Horschel makes a projected low owned GPP play. If you have any questions leading up to lineup lock Thursday morning you can reach me in a variety of ways.
294	294	12	13	target: Blayne Barber, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obligatory bet on Russell Knox (obviously) and threw a few darts with Blayne Barber, Michael Thompson, and Fabian Gomez at long odds.
862	862	33	33	target: Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s won the Reno-Tahoe open which also tends to favor West Coast specialists (Pat Perez was the runner-up, and I’ll get to him later), so there is a definitely connection. At this event, Piercy has three top-10s in the past five years. With John Rahm-chalk just above him and bigger names like Jimmy Walker and Kevin Na right below him in pricing, Piercy could go extremely overlooked this week.
5218	5218	19	20	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
1142	1142	5	6	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka - $8,900  3. Rickie Fowler - $7,900  4. Russell Knox - $7,400  5.
11560	11560	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler. I think all of these names are viable picks this week.
3748	3748	110	111	target: Aaron Baddeley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given this event immediately follows the US Masters again, as it has for the last four years and as it did between 1983 and 2010, I've taken a look at how the winners here this century had fared at Augusta. 2016 - Branden Grace - MC at Augusta  2015 - Jim Furyk - MC at Augusta  2014 - Matt Kuchar - 5th at Augusta  2013 - Graeme McDowell - MC at Augusta  2010 - Jim Furyk - MC at Augusta  2009 - Brian Gay - Didn't play at the Masters  2008 - Boo Weekley - 20th at Augusta  2007 - Boo Weekley - Didn't play at the Masters  2006 - Aaron Baddeley - Didn't play at the Masters  2005 - Peter Lonard - MC at Augusta  2004 - Stewart Cink - 17th at Augusta  2003 - Davis Love - 15th at Augusta  2002 - Justin Leonard - 20th at Augusta  2001 - Jose Coceres - MC at Augusta  2000 - Stewart Cink - 28th at Augusta  It's a mixed bag and it doesn't reveal an awful lot but given eight of the last ten winners have either not played there or missed the cut at Augusta, a high finish in last week's major is far from imperative. Is There an Identikit Winner?
1661	1661	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Jimmy Walker - Jimmy Walker has been somewhat quietly playing good golf since winning the PGA Championship. He shocked with a MC at the Sony Open; don't expect that here.
1322	1322	38	38	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We have seen before that some players become more prolific winners in their twilight years, so at 40/1 I am willing to chance that he will ride this good form for a bit longer and at least contend. Perez has four top-10’s and a further two top-20’s here since 2005, so he has enjoyed relative success on this course. I have high hopes that he can match or better his 4th place finish here in 2008 and therefore do think he is worth having on side at 40/1.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
12946	12946	49	50	target: JIMMY WALKER 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However as I’ve said a few times in this preview already the slightest of adjustments could change this dramatically and if this were to happen and Zach got right in the hunt there is no doubting his ability to get the job done. UPDATED 3rd APRIL  MASTERS TRADER - JIMMY WALKER Finished 20th  As has been well document Walker has been struggling over the past twelve months plus after being diagnosed with the debilitating illness Lyme Disease. [coincidentally he was diagnosed on the eve of the 2017 Masters].
7254	7254	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
3496	3496	32	32	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thomas called his former Alabama team-mate, Lee Knox as soon as he qualified for the Masters last year, organising to stay with him throughout the week. The advantage of doing so, was Thomas managed to go out on practice rounds with Lee’s father, Jeff who we all know very well. Knox is the non-playing marker at Augusta National, and if required (when an odd number of players make the cut) often beats his playing partners, although his score is never official.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
5777	5777	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two spots remaining, we have $18,300 left to work with. Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler . FanDuel is back and they have a new format.
6265	6265	28	29	target: Bud Cauley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, instead of targeting year-long stats, I’m focusing on rolling stats from the past five weeks. Looking at this data, the field leaders in SG:APP are Kyle Stanley, Bud Cauley, Justin Thomas, Mark Hubbard, Marc Leishman, Byeong-Hun An, David Lingmerth, and Rickie Fowler. Strokes Gained Off-the-Tee (SG:OTT): Similar to what I said above, strokes gained stats are the most important ones when we see a new venue.
6792	6792	66	67	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
4628	4628	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson ($12,500) – Don’t try to be the smartest guy in the room by fading DJ here, because there’s about a 90+% chance that you won’t be. In his last six appearances here – and we know how much better he has gotten in that time – DJ’s worst finish is T20.
6500	6500	17	19	target: Tyrone Van Aswegen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			During his streak, he's up nearly six percentage points and slots a season-best T44 in the stat. Tyrone Van Aswegen … No golfer puts four rounds together regularly, but the absence of it entirely is the ironic constant among rank-and-filers. When expectations need to remain high to sustain a livelihood at this level, any spark can be monumental, not to mention lucrative.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
235	235	46	46	target: Berger. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was injured shortly after the win and was forced to withdraw from the Bridegestone Invitational which burnt a lot of people. I am hoping with a combination of that and the enormous amount of great plays in the $6K range lead to low ownership for Berger. He is coming off a T5 at teh Travelers that could have easily been another win had he not crapped the bed with a 74 on Sunday.
6073	6073	9	9	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The combination of that with his stellar approach, and Casey will be in position to sink birdie putts constantly this week. That’s the one area where Casey has been atrocious: he doesn’t crack the top-100 golfers on Tour in any major putting category, although he’s T1 for putts inside 3’ at a whopping 100% conversion rate! * That would normally be a concern, but with the way the course is set up with easy putts to sink, Casey’s normal downfall won’t be as big of a factor as it would be elsewhere.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
6119	6119	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(gpp)  Anirban Lahiri ($7,500) – Par 4 scoring machine when he’s on and he definitely has the ability to come out hot. (gpp)  Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Had a MC last week but I’m not worried. He fits this course and has been solid all season.
12052	12052	26	27	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the week breaks down more and we release our ownership projections I’ll have a better idea of what I’m doing personally with Tiger in DFS. Hideki Matsuyama – Top End GPP – DK $9700 FD: $11400  It’s always risky playing players in their return from a withdrawal. It becomes even riskier when there is a language barrier and the player has not directly interviewed about the matter.
3178	3178	25	25	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2008, it was Johnson Wagner and his local connections which upset the apple cart and while Paul Casey, Anthony Kim, Hunter Mahan and Phil Mickelson represent more obvious champions, it's pretty clear that this event has been somewhat hard to predict. Of those mentioned, Stenson and Mickelson look sure to play well and it was interesting to note the latter's comments in last week's Match Play, which convince me that he's worth having on-side despite Houston's in-built volatility. When asked about Augusta, Mickelson was keen to stress that he has another event to play first and, considering how confident he's become in his game of late, he expects to contend.
7703	7703	4	5	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
11105	11105	41	42	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Russell Knox; 2) Tommy Fleetwood; 3) Tyrrell Hatton; 4) Billy Horschel / Alex Noren; 6) Keegan Bradley / Sergio Garcia / Martin Kaymer; 9) Dylan Frittelli / Scott Piercy; 11) Peter Uihlein; 12) John Peterson / Justin Thomas; 14) Gary Woodland; 15) Kevin Kisner / Adam Scott; 17) J.J. Henry / Patton Kizzire; 19) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Chesson Hadley / Hudson Swafford. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Jason Dufner; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Tiger Woods; 5) Tyrrell Hatton; 6) Alex Noren; 7) Wesley Bryan; 8) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Rickie Fowler / Tommy Fleetwood / Sergio Garcia; 12) Padraig Harrington; 13) Austin Cook; 14) David Lingmerth / Bernd Wiesberger; 17) Brian Gay / Patton Kizzire; 19) Daniel Berger / Louis Oosthuizen / Ollie Schniederjans. Winners & Prices : 2017: Fowler 16/1 ; 2016: Scott 20/1 ; 2015: Harrington 400/1 ; 2014: Henley 300/1 ; 2013: Thompson 300/1 ; 2012: McIlroy 9/1 ; 2011: Sabbatini 80/1 ; 2010: Villegas 30/1 ; Average: 85/1.
10314	10314	29	30	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Temperatures in La Jolla will be mild for the first two rounds with no precipitation in the forecast, so don’t expect a morning/afternoon tee-time advantage. Past Champions    2017 - Jon Rahm  2016 - Brandt Snedeker  2015 - Jason Day  2014 - Scott Stallings  2013 - Tiger Woods  2012 - Brandt Snedeker  2011 - Bubba Watson  2010 - Ben Crane    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jon Rahm - $18,000    After notching a second victory in his last three starts at last week’s CareerBuilder Challenge, Rahm is the betting favorite once again as he looks to defend his title at Torrey Pines. The Spaniard even has a chance to overtake Dustin Johnson’s No.
2764	2764	17	18	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I expect him to break out very soon and contend for his first Tour title. DraftKings bargain: Scott Brown ($6,700). I don’t think you’ll have to go too deep this week considering the strength of field, but if you want Justin Thomas or Henrik Stenson then Brown is a good option.
11595	11595	33	33	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			SHOW INDEX 0:04 General Nonsense with ANDERCUST 5:04 David Carr 10:19 Tim Curses the Raiders a...

3519	3519	49	49	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His big finishes at the 2014 majors were preceded by a strong performance the week before (three times he had a top 10, including T6 in Houston) so his prep, which included some good sessions with Butch Harmon, looks spot on. With form of 4-1-16-12-3 heading to the Masters, Fowler looks all set for a massive week and his ability to handle windy conditions could be very useful given the forecast for the first two days (gusts of 30-35mph Thursday and 25-30mph Friday). How about an Englishman handing the green jacket to another Englishman?
3401	3401	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recommended bets: The Masters      2pts e.w. Rickie Fowler at 22/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Bill Haas at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w.
6404	6404	1	1	target: Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			David Lingmerth is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. It will be interesting to see how Lingmerth responds after leading the first three rounds last week, only to falter in Sunday’s final round. Lingmerth has finished no worse than 16th here at the Old White, with two top-10 finishes in three starts.
6579	6579	30	30	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The scrubs in these tournaments are trash, and the upside a top tiered golfer offers isn’t much higher than someone in the $9K range. That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls.
7367	7367	18	18	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His ball striking ability should be able to help him get around Royal Birkdale without too many issues. Steele is also one of the best drivers of the ball in the field, in terms of both accuracy and distance. Steele is a sneaky pick to bounce back nicely while everyone has moved on to greener grass.
11811	11811	22	22	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dufner's game fits nicely, and he has shown that with his success here over the years. In his past nine appearances here, Dufner has not finished outside the top 30 once, and during that time, he has posted four top-20s. In his past five tournaments this year, Dufner has made every cut and posted three top-20s.
1717	1717	6	6	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Between 2013-2014 on the PGA Tour, Stanley only managed two third-place finishes in 2013 and just a solitary top-10 in the whole of 2014. Stanley managed five top-20’s over the next two years but failed to post a top-10, however he looks to be making his way back. So far, in six events this season, Stanley has made five of his cuts, finishing inside the top-22 on four of those occasions.
222	222	1	1	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth ($11000)  His game hasn’t been at his best this year, but these are the type of events he really brings the best of his game out in. Spieth’s been M.I.A. in the last several months apart from major events, presumably working on his game to get it into the form we saw last season.
12168	12168	3	4	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fervor that Tiger Woods manufactured at last week's Valspar Championship was all the most skeptical needed to close the chapter on any residual doubt in his latest return to competition. His performance aligned with candor, honesty, adjusted expectations and the glint of his old and still familiar fire. It reminded us of all that once was good and that he could be again.
3767	3767	27	27	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely. Overall, his price is super affordable and he should be inspired for a rebound after missing the Masters last week.
4925	4925	18	19	target: “Michael Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is going to make a pick and/or call every week and it will be in this section. “Michael Kim ($6,600) is my guy I’m guaranteeing a top 20 under 7k”  So, there you have it complete with a new section. As always hit me up on twitter if I can be of any help to you.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
1272	1272	4	4	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
1076	1076	33	34	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a "home" game for Kuchar, so this year playing on two courses (Seaside and Plantation) should give him just a slight advantage over many of the other players. Jonathan Coachman -- Zach Johnson ($9,700)  This week I am going with someone who is always comfortable playing in this part of the country because he lives there -- Johnson. He hasn't had the year he would have wanted, but winning in the final event of 2016 can change all of that.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
9543	9543	12	12	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, like Harman, Kisner was in contention throughout at Erin Hills. Cameron Smith - $7,600 (30-1)    Here's a case of the odds not being in sync with the DraftKings price – the oddsmakers like Smith more, and that catches our eye. Smith was pretty active during the fall, as many Australians tend to be, and he's riding a streak of four straight top-five cashes.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
12834	12834	1	1	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While JT gets the headline vote, I don't see any great need to make the case against the rest of those at the front of the betting. Each has their chance, and each is well worth considering, but truth be told only Spieth came close to selection alongside Thomas. Spieth's record here is outstanding - he's led at the conclusion of eight rounds from just 16 played - and he did what he needed to do at Houston last week.
3067	3067	12	12	target: Bryson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A big week here wouldn’t be a surprise to me at all. Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000): Bryson isn’t quite where he was last year when he was challenging for the win at Augusta, but he looked semi-close his last time out at the Valspar. While his putting continues to be a challenge his tee to green game has been solid his last two times out.
4835	4835	16	17	target: Chris Kirk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Jordan Spieth: 18th TPC4S/MC Sawgrass/2nd Augusta/13th GC of Houston. Chris Kirk: 13th Sawgrass/69th Heritage/33rd Augusta/8th TPC San Antonio. Adam Scott: 38th Sawgrass/14th Augusta/3rd Bay Hill/25th Doral.
898	898	5	5	target: Ogilvy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t believe the 250/1 on Ogilvy in Vegas is still standing. 200/1 Sabbatini very big also. Small dart at Hoge 200/1 too
2729	2729	105	106	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Kevin Streelman; 2) Ross Fisher; 3) Keegan Bradley; 4) Henrik Stenson; 5) Charles Howell III / Sergio Garcia; 7) Russell Knox / Justin Rose; 9) Jordan Spieth; 10) Gary Woodland; 11) Paul Casey; 12) Adam Hadwin / Adam Scott; 14) Tony Finau / Hudson Swafford; 16) Lucas Glover / Peter Uihlein; 18) Byeong-Hun An / Billy Horschel; 20) Branden Grace. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Matthew Fitzpatrick; 2) Peter Malnati; 3) Sergio Garcia; 4) Chesson Hadley / Webb Simpson / Tiger Woods; 7) Sam Saunders; 8) Zach Johnson; 9) Cameron Smith; 10) Matt Kuchar; 11) Ollie Schniederjans; 12) Jason Dufner / Charley Hoffman; 14) Dominic Bozzelli / Adam Hadwin / Louis Oosthuizen; 17) Justin Rose; 18) Austin Cook / Brian Gay; 20) Michael Kim. Winners & Prices : 2017: Hadwin 125/1 ; 2016: Schwartzel 33/1 ; 2015: Spieth 16/1 ; 2014: Senden 125/1 ; 2013: Streelman 200/1 ; 2012: Donald 11/1 ; 2011: Woodland 100/1 ; 2010: Furyk 30/1 ; Average: 80/1.
1939	1939	24	24	target: Phil 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players with good records tend to go well here and Snedeker could follow up the disappointment of Torrey with a great performance this week. Phil Mickelson 20/1  Phil is a real horse for the course here in Pebble and could be another good linksy style player to keep on side here. He hasn’t finished worse than T21 in his last four events and seems to be getting better and better every week.
6073	6073	9	9	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The combination of that with his stellar approach, and Casey will be in position to sink birdie putts constantly this week. That’s the one area where Casey has been atrocious: he doesn’t crack the top-100 golfers on Tour in any major putting category, although he’s T1 for putts inside 3’ at a whopping 100% conversion rate! * That would normally be a concern, but with the way the course is set up with easy putts to sink, Casey’s normal downfall won’t be as big of a factor as it would be elsewhere.
1032	1032	7	7	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
1985	1985	15	15	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I hurt way too much last week. Price isn't the only thing to like about Reed as he has excellent course history with finishes of T22, T4, T7 and T21 last season. He ranks inside the Top 1o of West Coast Positive players and although the stats don't show it thus far, he is an amazing scrambler.
801	801	6	6	target: CASEY, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WellsFargoChampionship win: DJ in mix: RAHM, CASEY, webb, BRYAN, berger 💣: poston, gay 5/1 is your only hope. 💰e… https://t.co/OzxPWUtlnc
7669	7669	62	62	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will have plenty of local support so will see a lot of familiar faces and while he readily admits he is still learning about life on the PGA Tour – his schedule will be less busy next season for one – he still has lofty aspirations of making the Tour Championship and even the Presidents Cup team. Life is good for Hughes at the moment with a child on the way as well and he looks in a decent place to outplay a very big quote in the betting. Where to watch on TV: Sky Sports Golf  Posted at 2125 BST on 31/07/17.
6545	6545	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries. Cink is one of the best in the field in SG: Approach. He’ll be wildly popular we suspect in DraftKings GPPs, but it’s too great of a bargain to pass up.
9730	9730	33	34	target: Gary Woodland, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman has finished no worse than T20 in the past three years, so expect the lefty precision player to convert plenty of birdies and continue his good form. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Gary Woodland, $10,200 – Not typically who you’d think of at a venue like Waialae, Woodland has finished 6th, 13th and third his past three trips. Woodland’s elite tee-to-green game is a huge asset at this venue, all he needs to do is putt a little better than normal to post a great finish.
726	726	8	8	target: An 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
186	186	3	3	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SonyOpen Picks Luau Jimmy 22-1 Paul Casey 28-1 Russell Knox 40-1 Daniel 🍔 40-1 Scott Piercy 40-1 Chris Kirk 50-1 Harris English 60-1
4643	4643	34	35	target: Zac Blair, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards). Again like Blair, John Huh is also very accurate off the tee, and this is a course where a lack of distance won’t hurt and it’s a key to put the ball at the right yardage.
13368	13368	119	120	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) Ryan Armour; 3) Jim Furyk / Shubhankar Sharma; 5) Chad Campbell / Sergio Garcia; 7) Keegan Bradley; 8) David Hearn; 9) Michael Thompson; 10) Vaughn Taylor; 11) Martin Laird; 12) Chris Kirk / Kevin Na; 14) Fabian Gomez; 15) Andrew Landry; 16) Kevin Streelman / Andrew Yun; 18) Russell Knox; 19) Alex Cejka / Billy Horschel / Pat Perez / Jonathan Randolph. Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Sergio Garcia; 3) Trey Mullinax; 4) Luke List; 5) Tom Lovelady / Brendan Steele; 7) Keegan Bradley; 8) Charley Hoffman / Xander Schauffele; 10) Michael Thompson; 11) Scott Piercy / Adam Schenk; 13) Jason Kokrak / J.T.
4752	4752	26	26	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His year started with a bang, grabbing a T3 at the Career Builder Challenge, and he has top-10 performances in his two most recent events. Still, Cauley has recently struggled with bogeys . .
10116	10116	23	24	target: J.J. Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has reeled off five consecutive top 20s (with two top 10s), and he has made seven of eight cuts at the CareerBuilder. J.J. Spaun  I said last week that I’m riding Spaun until he wins, and I’m no flip-flopper. J.J. again was hot with his iron at Waialae, but, as is the theme with many this week, would have been better off putting with a hybrid.
5363	5363	21	21	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field. Adam Scott, $10300 – Returning to Memphis for the first time in 10 years -- he finished seventh in that edition -- Scott is hoping to tune up his game for Erin Hills and pick up a much needed win. Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year.
2784	2784	4	4	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week. Ryan Moore - Ryan Moore had a top-30 finish last week in Mexico and should be able to build on that performance at Innisbrook where he’s produced top-five finishes each of the last two years.
5600	5600	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Maybe his trusty Trackman is the Little Dutch Boy plugging that leak, maybe not. Whatever the case, Dustin Johnson is the defending U.S. Open champion and has evolved into the best golfer on the planet over the last six months. The Official World Golf Rankings tell me that -- he leads No.
8931	8931	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That makes him a very nice rebound candidate this week. Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations.
12242	12242	4	5	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot. All told, that's eight wins in 10 matches at the course and he also won three group games from three at Harding Park in 2015, eventually losing to Jim Furyk in the quarters having seen off Rickie Fowler in the last-16.
320	320	21	22	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With great current form and a near winner last week Day could go one better and win in style this week. Patrick Reed 25/1  The young American really stepped up to the plate last week and got the job done in Bethpage with a great win. He has been knocking on the door a lot over the last few months with six top 15’s and a win in his last 10 events.
4821	4821	15	15	target: Johnson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of note is the fact that even though he hasn’t hit it great in 2017, Johnson’s around the green and putting stats are both still inside the top 50 for the year, two factors which often pay huge dividends around Colonial. We’re not exactly buying low here but we are buying for lower ownership which I think makes sense given Johnson’s history at this event. He’s a great gpp pick in my eyes this week.
2556	2556	67	67	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whilst the Swede is yet to perform at that same level in Majors and WGCs, just one top ten in 25 combined starts, he does arrive in Mexico on the back of his best WGC finish of T12th at last year's WGC HSBC Champions. Many believe the elevation of the course this week will have it play similar to Crans-sur-Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters, which Noren has won twice including last year. Noren has three top 25 finishes in four starts so far this season but could add some value in your Fantasy team in a strong field this week in Mexico.
5340	5340	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On to the Picks! Next Day Air  Brooks Koepka $11,500 – He finished second here last year, 3rd the year before and 19th in 2014. I watched him all last week on Shot Tracker and his biggest issue seemed to be making putts.
2472	2472	18	18	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be in for some positive regression this week. When looking at our European Tour comp courses, Garcia fits. He’s especially fond of Crans Sur Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters.
9381	9381	4	5	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Embed from Getty Images  Kevin Kisner $8,400 – We’ve spoken to a couple of caddies on the PGA Tour that say the most important factors at Kapalua are putting, wedge play, and staying aggressive. Enter Kevin Kisner. He’s only outranked by two other players in the field over the last five years in SG: Putting and 3 Putt Avoidance (Spieth & Brooks).
4977	4977	1	1	target: Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall. Duf Daddy has two runner-up finishes at Colonial (2012 and 2014) and finished sixth last year. Moreover, he has made nine straight cuts and has seven top-25 finishes during that stretch.
11040	11040	13	13	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At his worst, he’s a grinder who can get you to the weekend. Keegan Bradley  If you have a pacemaker, please, for your own safety, do not roster Keegan. The stress will have you in the emergency room.
8582	8582	42	43	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are firm and you have a lot of options for shots around the greens." Weather Forecast    TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting at 19:00 on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Patrick Reed -9  2015 - Jason Day -19  2014 - Hunter Mahan -14  2013 - Adam Scott -11  2012 - Nick Watney -10      What Will it Take to Win the Northern Trust? It's never easy when a new venue is used but it sounds like the fairways are generous enough so Driving Accuracy is probably a stat to ignore.
6101	6101	8	9	target: Lucas Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At $6,500 why not play the hot hand? Lucas Glover – $6,600 and a strong cut maker. When he is in sync he pushes top 10/25 territory.
7501	7501	34	35	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
372	372	0	0	target: Berger/Kuchar/Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Berger/Kuchar/Kirk have me at first look. Berger is essentially an every start bet for me now, Somewhere along the… https://t.co/GepfpOJK8N
1679	1679	0	2	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charles Howell III ($7,300) has made nine of his last ten cuts. He's been averaging 3.9 strokes gained tee to green… https://t.co/YKdMbEPWvP
12647	12647	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the GOLF GODS exist, they’ll be worth a couple of shots this week. Brandt Snedeker: He’s never made the cut but his last trip was 2013. He was one shot out of the lead at Valspar before fading with 78.
11	11	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
4127	4127	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week. He is surrounded by two guys with more than twice the amount of mentions then him, Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore, who will likely soak up a ton of ownership.
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
12058	12058	32	32	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I especially like him in cash games because his $7,500 price tag gives you a solid cut-maker with upside and saves some salary-cap space for other high-end options. -- Jeff Bergerson  Emiliano Grillo  Although Grillo faded down the stretch at the Hero Indian Open and is flying across the world to play this week, he still offers excellent value at his price tag. He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season.
1206	1206	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And he also showed it when winning this tournament two years ago. Reed posted 21-under on that occasion before showing his one-to-one skills by defeating compatriot Jimmy Walker in a play-off. There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
1817	1817	13	13	target: Berger: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy him before Bubba Watson ($8,300) or Padraig Harrington ($8,500). Throwing Darts  Daniel Berger: $7,000  Berger didn't have his best stuff at Torrey Pines where he missed the cut, but it's not a course he plays well. He tied for 10th at the WMPO in 2015, so he's proved capable at the desert course.
3043	3043	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one. I have a slight concern with Kirk in that he’s never played here before, but raw talent should get him into contention this week. He’s a great putter and wedge player and should take advantage of the par-5s.
5927	5927	11	12	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has been overlooked lately and I think the trend continues. Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Bud has cooled off in his last 3 events and this is right when I want to get back on board. He is a scorer and this course does not present the dangers the last 3 events have played.
7883	7883	11	11	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – WGC-Bridgestone Invitational  Lock of the week:  Rickie Fowler – $10,600 – Rickie’s in impeccable form as of late in tough fields, his SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his three T10’s at Firestone Country Club in the last five years make him a clear lock in any format. He’s a slight cost savings as well, just cracking the five digit mark at $10,600. We won’t care how popular Fowler will be this week as his golf has been consistent with 14/16 cuts made this season and three Top-10s in his past four starts.
1428	1428	8	8	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ThePME @fantasynational I see a lot of Captain Kirk 😎
13228	13228	14	15	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a decent week at Augusta and should do well here with his length. Luke Donald – It’s hard to look past Donald at Hilton Head, despite him never winning there. His record speaks for itself so he should contend.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
621	621	6	6	target: Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley. Winners & Prices : 2016: McIlroy 13/2 ; 2015: Spieth 9/1 ; 2014: Horschel 25/1 ; 2013: Stenson 16/1 ; 2012: Snedeker 40/1 ; 2011: Haas 45/1 ; 2010: Furyk 20/1 ; Average: 23/1.
7204	7204	33	34	target: Jordan Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Jordan Spieth. He didn’t hit it great down the stretch at Travelers, but he figured out a way to win, which is what a champion does on Open Championship week.
8518	8518	19	20	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman ranks 5th in Par 4 Scoring, 6th in SG: Putting, 13th in BoB% and 15th in SG: T2G. Tony Finau ($7,300): A ball strikers course with Tony Finau priced near the bottom of the field. SIGN ME UP!
13241	13241	2	2	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head. Moreover, his lack of driving accuracy (140th) and iffy iron game (60th in strokes gained: approach) forecast trouble.
3592	3592	28	28	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Berge is a solid player in every category, but does a great job on the green which should help him have a strong run at Augusta. Last year, Berger had a strong finish in 10th place and will be a high owned pick in cash and GPPs because of his play last week and overall strong play in the 2017 season. Francesco Molinari will be one of the better scorers of the tournament on par 5’s and has a shot to knock down some eagles.
12285	12285	101	102	target: Harris English. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi; 9) Fabian Gomez; 10) Richy Werenski; 11) Brice Garnett / Graeme McDowell / Rory Sabbatini; 14) Tim Herron; 15) Ben Crane; 16) Scott Piercy; 17) Alex Cejka / Joel Dahmen / Tyler Duncan; 20) Davis Love III. Greens in Regulation : 1) Scott Piercy; 2) Sam Ryder; 3) Emiliano Grillo; 4) Corey Conners; 5) J.J. Henry; 6) Denny McCarthy / Rory Sabbatini; 8) Kevin Tway; 9) Andrew Putnam; 10) Nate Lashley; 11) Davis Love III; 12) Tyler Duncan / Xin-Jun Zhang; 14) Jonathan Byrd; 15) Brett Stegmaier; 16) Tim Herron / Adam Schenk; 18) Martin Flores / Keith Mitchell; 20) Harris English. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Ricky Barnes; 2) Emiliano Grillo; 3) Lanto Griffin; 4) Andres Romero; 5) Greg Chalmers / Michael Kim; 7) Scott Piercy; 8) David Lingmerth; 9) Troy Merritt; 10) Harris English / Trey Mullinax; 12) Jim Furyk / Tom Lovelady; 14) Fabian Gomez / Mike Weir; 16) Martin Flores / Ethan Tracy; 18) Robert Garrigus / Ricky Werenski; 20) Johnson Wagner.
13035	13035	32	32	target: Cabrera-Bello 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a lock for cash games this week and do not be surprised if he uses his momentum to make a run at a top-10 finish. -- Zach Turcotte  Rafael Cabrera Bello  Cabrera-Bello returns to Augusta for his third straight start at this event and FanDuel has a mouthwatering salary for him this week. The lower $7k range on FanDuel is typically reserved for golfers with slim chances at contending for the week and Cabrera-Bello is far from that.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
1114	1114	32	33	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value-tier golfers with similar metrics have manufactured a very healthy +8.73 Plus/Minus with 64.5 percent Consistency. Course & Field Adjusted Birdies Per Tournament  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Yet another #SeaIslandMafia underboss, Matt Kuchar leads the high-priced tier and is tied for third in the field with a 14.8 LT Adj Bird Avg. Kuchar’s 68.5 LT Adj Rd Score is the best in the field, and he’s tied for second with Brandt Snedeker with 5.3 percent Odds to Win.
2351	2351	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott - Adam Scott is the overall favorite to win the Honda Classic, but you can still fetch him with odds of +1100. Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage.
10437	10437	26	26	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough. English has not only put up 6-of-6 made cuts, he’s finished inside the top-15 three times at TPC Scottsdale! Now, English did underperform last year, but he’s a two-time PGA Tour winner with youth and upside to bounce back.
7866	7866	25	25	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look no further then Jason Day. I think with Day’s price and relative performance this year he should realistically see smaller ownership as Rahm, Stenson, Kuchar and Garcia all eat up some of his exposure within the same price range. In Day’s latest appearance at The Open Championship he showed signs of his game returning with a T27 finish.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
521	521	19	19	target: Westwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FRO - Jeremy Chapman - Houston Open - 1.5pt ew Henley 40-1, Stenson 14-1; 1ew Mickelson 22-1, 0.5pt ew Westwood 100-1, K Bradley 70-1
1877	1877	33	33	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has still finished no worse than 21st this season, after finishing 16th in Phoenix last week and he looks in perfect shape to compete at one of, if not his favourite stop. Mickelson is clearly desperate for a win, as he showed again this past Sunday. He got himself close to contention after an impressive front-9 but his back-9 was his undoing.
6188	6188	10	11	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Quicken Loans National  1. Rickie Fowler  2. Bill Haas  3.
9188	9188	32	32	target: Perez, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Though these skills translate everywhere, this type of game excels in low-scoring events like this one, where converting birdies and making clutch pars on the greens are important to maintaining momentum. Pat Perez, $9300 – This week’s defending champion has finished no worse than 24th in the last two months, including his victory at the CIMB. Converging trends of history and form don’t get much better than Perez this week, meaning he’ll be heavily owned on Fanduel, but a good pick nonetheless.
11429	11429	32	32	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played in this tournament last year, and if it weren’t for an opening round 76, his T55 finish would look much, much better. What is different from last year, is that Noren was not playing nearly as much as he has been in 2018, making his results from last year tough to compare. I’m all in and Noren is a lock for cash.
245	245	11	11	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
1624	1624	19	19	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 adds just now over at sportsbook: Knox 50 Ollie 60 Kizzire 60 They join from yesterday: Tommy 30, Harman 35, Billy Ho 100
2678	2678	29	30	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some courses are just going to be too big for him, but a place like Copperhead is where he can thrive, evidenced by his playoff runner-up finish last year. Graham DeLaet ($8,400) – Don’t look now, but DeLaet is starting to regain his PGA Tour relevance at a very rapid pace. With top 20 finishes at Phoenix, Riviera, and PGA National, DeLaet is clearly returning to form as one of the best ball strikers in the game, even if his scrambling and putting still aren’t quite up to snuff.
2441	2441	21	22	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love his ballstriking. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Justin Rose - $9,600 Jon Rahm - $9,000 Sergio Garcia - $8,500 Jason Dufner - $8,100 Rafa Cabrera-Bello - $7,400 Louis Oosthuizen - $7,200  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

12634	12634	27	27	target: Lovemark. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Luke List looks incredibly short despite a good record at the course, and I'd rather take a chance on a man so easily confused with him, Jamie Lovemark. When An went closest to his breakthrough in Louisiana, so did Lovemark, somehow losing a play-off to Brian Stuard having missed a glorious opportunity to close the door in regulation. He's also had a chance to win here, leading through 54 holes in 2016, and one of the more powerful players on the circuit is clearly advantaged by a relatively low-scoring test on a par 72 which doesn't punish his wayward driving.
5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
1018	1018	2	3	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Sleeper: Luke List.
13156	13156	63	63	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey won the Valspar Championship last month, his first main Tour victory since 2014, and we all know about Phil Mickelson's 5 year drought ending with a cracking victory at the WGC-Mexico Championship the week before Casey's victory. So in Simpson we have a 4-time PGA Tour winner who hasn't won since October 2013. Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one.
727	727	3	4	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson. In three years, he has two top 10s here at Sheshan Golf Club, including a win in 2014.
7688	7688	2	3	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
11875	11875	2	3	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
5377	5377	28	28	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s fired just one round in the 60’s since April, and the price is too high to risk for a guy who can’t seem to find a top-10. Scott has averaged 58% of his fairways this year, ranking back at 126th which will not suit this golf course. We’d much rather roll with the safer Molinari or pay up for Fowler.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
7838	7838	8	9	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign. It will be interesting to see what Brooks’ ownership will be this week on DK, but I’d venture to guess he’ll be going off as lesser-owned than any of the players above him, making him a perfect gpp target.
815	815	3	3	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5. Strokes Gained Approach to Green – Simpson, Garrigus, Cejka, Taylor, DeLeat  Player Focus: The Shriners  On the Rise: Pretty bad week overall.
304	304	37	37	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open. When the disappointment fades, and it will quickly, Fowler should be thrilled to have been in contention again. We know he likes this track, having chased down Henrik Stenson to win here last year.
6027	6027	58	59	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TPC River Highlands plays a whopping 1,000 yards shorter than Erin Hills, though the winning scores here recently have been close to the 16-under we saw last week in Wisconsin. As this is a par-70 track, it's safe to call this week a birdie-fest.The tournament gets quite a boost this year in the form of Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, in their Cromwell debuts, plus Jason Day. After those three there are Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed, but for the most part the field drops off precipitously, with only eight of the OWGR Top 30 on hand.
12881	12881	48	48	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We know the green jacket isn’t won with stats but this is a profile worthy of one of the best players on Tour and I’m going to continue to keep him onside in majors while he is priced alongside those who simply aren’t as suited to championship courses. Steele is a streaky putter who is usually better on consistently fast surfaces so if he putts well there is no reason he can’t contend. But one of my favourite bets of the week is for him to make the top 20 and hopefully if he can’t stay on the leaderboard that bet will pay for the more speculative win and each way bets.
12013	12013	12	13	target: Justin Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Argentine enters this year playing his best golf in a while. Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
6289	6289	18	18	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is sixth on Tour in greens in regulation and 47th in both SG: Tee-to-Green and approach. Matt Jones - $6,700 (80-1)    Jones is a curious guy. For a golfer costing $6,700, he has odds of only 80-1.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
1589	1589	27	29	target: Charles Howell III: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer has always had an erratic streak that has kept him from ascending to the upper echelons, and this was yet another week that exemplifies that tendency. Charles Howell III: Another week, another top 15 finish from CH3. The transition to PXG and recovery from his injury late last season have clearly returned Chalk Howell back to his prominent, consistent form.
1469	1469	25	25	target: Spaun’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 26-year-old punched his ticket to the big league by winning the News Sentinel Open but it’s the style of his victories that I like. Spaun’s winning score in Knoxville was 26-under and his money-list winning season on the PGA Tour Canada was driven by taking apart easy courses. Spaun is 3/6 in cuts made this season but rounds of 65 at the OHL Classic and RSM Classic have hinted at his potential.
5386	5386	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Brooks Koepka  The man has only played the event three times and he's gotten better each year. From T-19 to T-3 to runner-up in 2016.
1399	1399	19	21	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
98	98	28	29	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alex Cejka ($7,000) has withdrawn. 2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Jason Day $12,400  Rory McIlroy $11,600  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Phil Mickelson $9,700  Rickie Fowler $9,300  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Charl Schwartzel $8,500  Jimmy Walker $8,200  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Patrick Rodgers $7,400  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Daniel Berger $6,900  JB Holmes $6,400  Webb Simpson $6,000  Brendan Steele $5,900  Rickie Fowler $9,300  Louis Oosthuizen $9,000  Marc Leishman $7,900  Paul Casey $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between. You can watch the Pat Mayo Hour every weekday at 3:00pm EST, 8:00pm EST and Midnight on the FNTSY Sports Network Television channel or on your Apple TV, Xbox, Roku or Amazon Fire Stick.
12761	12761	47	48	target: Rory McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
7889	7889	29	30	target: event…Jon Rahm! 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam believes that Torrey Pines is a course that strongly resembles Firestone. By the way, guess who won at Torrey earlier this season their first time playing in the event…Jon Rahm! He’s an incredible ball striker with a caddie on the bag that knows Firestone quite well.
2692	2692	17	17	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finally – and here’s the absurd selection I referred to earlier – I can’t leave out Bryson DeChambeau at 300/1. Among the many small reasons for expecting improvement from DeChambeau is his form here as an amateur, which includes guiding SMU to victory when he was the only player in a good field to break 70 in both rounds at the course. Isolated, that’s nowhere near enough to make a case but DeChambeau caught the eye last time, striking the ball exceptionally well at the extremely difficult PGA National only to find all his work undone by one of the worst putting displays you’ll see.
4381	4381	18	18	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His all-around game has been impressive this year, as he’s currently 10th in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green. Glover is gaining most of his strokes on approach and should fit this course well. Combine his course fit with the fact that he’s made 6-of-7 cuts, and he should be in plenty of lineups this weekend.
10658	10658	35	36	target: Matt Kuchar; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Kevin Streelman; 3) Billy Horschel; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Chez Reavie; 6) Kevin Kisner / Shane Lowry / Pat Perez; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Scott Piercy; 11) Matt Kuchar; 12) Bryson DeChambeau / Russell Knox; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Corey Conners / Rory McIlroy; 18) Branden Grace; 19) Jason Kokrak / Andrew Putnam; 20) Austin Cook / Charley Hoffman / Sam Ryder / Gary Woodland. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Padraig Harrington; 3) Phil Mickelson; 4) Jon Rahm; 5) Matt Kuchar; 6) Kevin Kisner; 7) Chris Stroud; 8) Rafael Cabrera-Bello; 9) James Hahn / Maverick McNealy; 11) Gary Woodland; 12) Dominic Bozzelli / Whee Kim / Vaughn Taylor; 15) Brian Gay / Peter Malnati; 17) Branden Grace; 18) David Lingmerth; 19) Austin Cook / Retief Goosen / Cody Gribble / Ben Martin / Pat Perez. Winners & Prices : 2017: Spieth 9/1 ; 2016: Taylor 300/1 ; 2015: Snedeker 25/1 ; 2014: Walker 28/1 ; 2013: Snedeker 14/1 ; 2012: Mickelson 25/1 ; 2011: Points 80/1 ; 2010: Johnson 22/1 ; Average: 63/1.
303	303	10	10	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 2ew Thomas 18-1, Fowler 18-1; 1ew Kisner 40-1
13590	13590	22	22	target: Streelman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given his game has continued to improve and he still made the cut, Steele at $8900 is a very attractive price. Kevin Streelman, $7700 – Streelman has been well known to struggle on the putting green, but if the recent winners have shown, putting can be negligible on this track. His last 24 rounds have seen Streelman be 14th in SG: T2G, 15th in SG: OTT and 24th in Par 5 scoring.
12348	12348	4	4	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY PICK : Alex Noren ($8,700)  Noren doesn’t necessarily have the easiest opening group (Tony Finau, Thomas Pieters, Kevin Na), but the Swede has been one of the world’s best players over the past few months and owns the experience angle over his competitors. Noren has an underrated match-play record, having reached the semifinal of the Paul Laurie Match Play event in Europe in 2016 — winning five matches in a row to achieve that feat. He went 3-0 in his Austin pod last year and gave eventual winner Dustin Johnson a good run before losing out to him.
2191	2191	18	18	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
1373	1373	6	6	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winners for this week. Xander 100/1, Harkins 150/1 and Brazel 140/1. All ew.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
11197	11197	7	8	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is ranked 44th in driving accuracy. Stewart Cink - $6,800 (150-1)  Cink is in the odd position of going 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National but never securing a top-25 (he was T27 and T26 the past two years). So, if you are looking for a bargain-basement price with a really good chance to make the cut, Cink is your man.
13682	13682	24	24	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation.
11537	11537	59	60	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
4059	4059	4	4	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, all Cink needs to do is make the cut and score some more points on the weekend. He may not be the sexiest play by any means, but he does rank 31st in SG: Tee to Green, 15th in Par 4 Scoring, 50th in Bogey Avoidance, and 44th in Birdie or Better %. As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
11087	11087	46	46	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like places like that." Stats-wise this season, he's 9th for Driving Accuracy, 4th for Greens In Regulation, 11th for Scrambling and 8th for Strokes Gained: Putting so take out big hitting - something that isn't crucial on PGA National's Champions Course this week - and Harman is doing everything right. Oh, it's a par 70 as well so his third place in Par 4 Scoring Average adds to the mix.
4957	4957	40	41	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
2040	2040	71	72	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the shorter course manager type players, we’d like them to have Par 5 Scoring ability, as most in the Top 10, score half their final tallies on the Par 5’s. For players that have played these courses over the last 8 years, and at least twice, these players play it the best: Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Dustin Johnson, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Jason Day, Tim Clark, Pat Perez, Nick Watney, Jordan Spieth, Retief Goosen, Chesson Hedley, Brandt Snedeker, JB Holmes, Graeme Mcdowell, Mike Weir, Spencer Levin and Patrick Reed. So what do these guys have in common for the most part?
11875	11875	2	2	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
3174	3174	30	30	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last week's performance in Puerto Rico was a little disappointing in some respects, given that he'd put together successive top-25 finishes in much deeper fields previously, but it looks like Lee just didn't get anything going on the greens and it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. On his last start in this event, Lee missed the cut but a second-round 66 contained eight birdies and just one mistake, a costly double-bogey. Just two players in the field bettered his Friday score and he was very close to undoing the damage of round one.
302	302	15	15	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 2ew Thomas 18-1, Fowler 18-1; 1ew Kisner 40-1
1788	1788	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are a few names to consider at every different price level. High-Priced  Hideki Matsuyama ($11,700) – It’s not that I don’t like Spieth – it’s that I couldn’t justify putting anyone higher on this list than Matsuyama. He has been as hot as anyone in golf since last fall, consistently playing well enough to make cuts and at least getting into position to challenge for a top spot on the leaderboard week in and week out.
598	598	6	6	target: McGirt, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bets for this week: Knox, 50/1 McGirt, 66/1 Stanley, 80/1 Herman, 150/1 All outright only and to be followed by Top 20 bets.
5056	5056	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			UPPER TIER  Matt Kuchar ($9,400) – Steady Kuchar looked like a potential cut risk on Thursday/Friday last week, but in typical Kuchar fashion, he rallied back for a nice and easy T12 finish. There is nobody in this field with a better overall track record at this course, and when it comes to smooth, steady T2G play, Kuchar is among the best ever. Lock him in.
10523	10523	18	19	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've been slow to jump on the train, but I can't ignore the form plus local knowledge angle. Austin Cook ($8,300): Going with my second rookie, Cook certainly doesn't play like a rookie. He's beat the field average by four or more strokes in five of his seven starts this season.
3253	3253	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la creme  Rickie Fowler: $10,000  Spieth and Stenson will be the most highly owned golfers this week, and not without good reason. Consider fading them for the cheaper Rickie Fowler, who has been on a tepid march lately with a win and a trio of top-20 finishes in his last four starts. He's never missed the cut in Houston and has a pair of top-10 finishes.
8724	8724	19	20	target: (Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens are smaller than average and sectioned into quadrants. Don't discount the fact that the last two winners here (Jason Day and Zach Johnson) are among the tour's best putters. In addition to the aforementioned dexterity with the flatstick, aptitude with the driver (distance preferred!)
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
8577	8577	7	8	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Why not make it back to back? Paul Casey – $9,000  Even though he doesn’t win, Paul Casey loves to get out of the gates hot and wind up inside the top 15 in some way. It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
363	363	3	3	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T21  Phil Mickelson 1.5pts EW 35/1 with Get up to £50 in free bets via this link:  Phil Mickelson is another who I think is well suited to TPC Boston and circumstances are ripe for a Lefty victory in these FedEx Cup Playoffs after a magnificent season. Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016.
5781	5781	41	42	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've already used all four so its time to think outside the box. If we open up the criteria to top 20 in both tournament history AND long-term baseline performance we add the following names: Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott, Justin Rose, Jim Furyk, and Charl Schwartzel. I narrowed down to Rose or McIlroy at the Masters and picked wrong there.
11133	11133	38	38	target: Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fortunately Dominic had done enough by then to wrap up his card for 2018 and he returned to the tour in January at Hawaii. Understandably after 5 months off it was a slow start to the year for Bozzelli however he turned in his best performance of the season so far at last weeks Genesis Open with a 26th place finish. Dominic’s stats for the week in LA were promising in that he finished 21st in DA and 27th in GIR with the putter holding him back.
11017	11017	4	4	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Tom Hoge $6,600 – Hollywood Hoge is somewhat of a gut call down here in this range.
12887	12887	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance. While not all his stats are strong this year he does rank 1st in strokes gained: putting and 4th in par 4 scoring and I’m sure his whole 2018 campaign so far will have been geared to peaking this week.
9214	9214	1	1	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chesson Hadley  Hadley finished just one stroke out of the playoffs due to a bogey on the final hole. Still, a T4 finish is excellent for the price tag Hadley had on both DraftKings & FanDuel as he finished with the 3rd most fantasy points in both formats. Course Preview  The PGA Tour says goodbye to Las Vegas and is heading to Playa Del Carmen in Mexico.
3274	3274	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At less than $7,000, this is a no-brainer. Michael Kim - $6,400 (Field, 7-2)    Kim hit a rough patch of consecutive missed cuts at Riviera and the Honda, but he's cashed twice since, including a T17 in his last start at Bay Hill. That was his fifth top-25 already this season.
8043	8043	34	34	target: Johnson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson finished 14th here in 2014 after the changes were made to the greens and before that had finished 6th in 2011 and 11th in 2009. The changes made this week don’t play into Johnson’s hands, with the course being lengthened but as we know Johnsons is capable of winning and contending at courses that appear too long for him. With wins at Augusta and St. Andrews as well as contending last week at the 7,400 yard Firestone, it would be naïve to rule Johnson out based on the length of the course.
10158	10158	0	1	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			David Lingmerth - $14,200    The 30-year-old hasn’t played since a T17 at the RSM Classic as he took time off after becoming a father in December, but he’ll be back in action this week at the CareerBuilder Challenge where he’s finished runner-up twice in five starts. Lingmerth’s advantage will be the putter, having ranked sixth on Tour in one-putt percentage and 11th in putting from inside 10 feet last season. Bargain Bin    Brian Stuard - $14,000    Stuard impressed at the Sony Open with four consecutive rounds of 67 or less en route to his T4 finish, while he also led the field in driving accuracy and ranked second in SG: Putting.
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
392	392	32	32	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What we have to hope is his putter gets hot, and perhaps his success on these greens in the past will carry him to the top of the leaderboard this weekend. Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick.
6516	6516	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is still struggling a bit with his irons, but his scrambling is elite, and he’s making as many birdies as anyone on Tour. Reed has two top-30s at this course in three attempts, but he’s the firm favorite for me this week. Bill Haas ($10,800)  Haas is another player trending towards a win this summer.
413	413	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done. In Europe, Danny Willett defends the European Masters at the stunning Crans-Sur-Sierre in Switzerland.
7691	7691	9	9	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Get him while he’s feeling good. DraftKings bargain: Bill Haas, $6,900. His record at Firestone is OK, but Haas has been solid for months up until a missed cut at the Open.
10201	10201	28	28	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players whom they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Picks to win  Tony Finau  I've been telling anyone willing to listen that Finau is ready for a breakthrough season that could elevate him to top-10 player in the world status. On a long golf course like Torrey South, where he finished T-4 last year, he should thrive once again.
11365	11365	37	37	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5 couldn’t get much going here last year when shooting 70-72-71-71 to finish T38 but expect a real improvement on that. Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
1309	1309	0	1	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama  Price: $11,000  I wrote last week that I was going to continue to roll with Matsuyama until he cools off, and that's not changing now. Dating back to last fall, here's how the scintillating-hot 24-year-old has fared in his last six events: win, second place to Justin Thomas, win, win, win, second place to Justin Thomas. At some point he's going to finish outside of the Top 2, and there's a good chance that happens at Waialae, where he has three missed cuts (all as an amateur) and a DNF (2015), but he's just playing too well to fade right now.
5512	5512	25	26	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1.
7705	7705	3	3	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
9728	9728	56	56	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Past Champions    2017 – Justin Thomas  2016 – Fabian Gomez  2015 – Jimmy Walker  2014 – Jimmy Walker  2013 – Russell Henley  2012 – Johnson Wagner  2011 – Mark Wilson  2010 – Ryan Palmer  2009 – Zach Johnson  2008 – K.J. Choi    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth, $19,800    It’s clear Spieth and Justin Thomas are the cream of this week’s crop, but Spieth comes with a higher salary due to his strong finish last week at Kapalua. Spieth possesses all the course management and iron game necessary to slay this course, and with a third-place effort last season, he’ll be hungry for more this time around.
11711	11711	3	4	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Next Best: Back Ryan Moore EW @ 40/1  It's been said before that Copperhead also has plenty of nods towards courses in the Carolinas. So it's perhaps no coincidence that, just like Stenson, Ryan Moore is a former winner of the Wyndham Championship and has some excellent form here. Moore has been a regular visitor since coming on tour and as well as an early T8 in 2007 and a top 20 in 2009, he's been one of the best performers in this event over the last three years with finishes of 18-3-5.
8619	8619	14	14	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s my somewhat dark horse pick to win this week. MY SLEEPER : Emiliano Grillo ($6,900)  Grillo has had a tough year, punctuated by a stretch of four missed cuts in five starts to end the regular season. Grillo’s tee to green game hasn’t been that bad, however, and he bounced back nicely last week with a T29 at Glen Oaks — where he ranked T3 in Greens in Regulation and gained over 5.8 strokes on the field in his approaches.
4593	4593	56	56	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, for one reason or another, they have not made much noise on Tour of late and have seen their prices drop as a result. It was only a year ago that Day finished Top-10 in three majors and Stenson won his first major, and it has only been a matter of months since Thomas and Matsuyama were seemingly taking turns winning every other week. The pick in this group will be, who ranks in the Top 15 in all three categories mentioned in the opener and already owns three victories this season.Brooks Koepka – $15,700Francesco Molinari – $15,000Tyrrell Hatton – $14,100Bill Haas – $13,300The Pick: This is the widest range of players among this week’s groupings, but all these players are capable of filling out the middle of your lineup depending on what you do at the top or bottom.
540	540	4	4	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
510	510	7	8	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			• • •  Adam Schupak  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. The player who most reminds me of Long John Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA at Crooked Stick, is my pick. He’s coming off T-18 and T-8 in the first two legs of the FedEx Cup and will be able to bomb and gouge it this week to his third title of the season.
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
10246	10246	6	6	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Marc Leishman is a Torrey Pines specialist who as we know is in cracking form right now. Talk of coastal golf, Kikuyugrass fairways and tough, technical scoring conditions on the South Course shouts Leishman from the rooftops and he certainly has the tools at his disposal to make a serious challenge this week, with no attention on him whatsoever. A tournament average score of 70.75 is only beaten by Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker and Charles Howell III amongst tournament regulars.
10729	10729	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
13432	13432	51	52	target: Aaron Baddeley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2011 winner, Brendan Steele, was only 28 when he won but disregarding the 2010 and 2103 editions again, the other five winners, when conditions were typical, have all been in their 30s. Inaugural winner, Scott and the 2014 champ, Steven Bowditch, like the course designer, Norman, are both Aussies and Aaron Baddeley and Cameron Smith both finished inside the top-six places last year. Competitors from Down Under are well worth considering.
6275	6275	19	19	target: Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s desperate for a win to secure his spot on the President’s Cup team this Fall. Pivot Plays  David Lingmerth ($8,500) – I like that DK priced Lingmerth this highly because he was bound to be extreme chalk otherwise. I still love him this week, and now we should get him under 15% owned.
3390	3390	18	18	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As long as he can steer clear of Rae’s Creek and any lingering demons from last year’s collapse, Spieth will make an excellent play in guaranteed prize pools this year, even as one of the highest-salaried golfers in the field. With his history at Augusta and current form, Spieth seems poised to make another run at a green jacket this year. He is off to a great start this year and is poised to eclipse the massive numbers he posted in the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
10149	10149	0	1	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Aaron Wise - $12,100    It would be wise to throw a couple lower-priced darts into your lineups this week in order to stack a few of the weapons at the top. Wise, a rookie out of the University of Oregon, has experience not only winning on the Web.com Tour, but also finished top-35 at last year’s CareerBuilder and owns a pair of top-25s this season. The 21-year-old ranks 42nd on Tour in SG: Putting and 54th in SG: Off-the-Tee.
7610	7610	8	8	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag.
1614	1614	4	4	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda update Knox 45 Berger 50 Ollie 55 Grillo 80 Wiesberger 80 Horschel 100
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
7690	7690	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
2533	2533	47	47	target: Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price. Finally, I want to side with Kevin Na in some way and the top-five and top-10 markets look best. In essence, Na is another accurate type, with form at altitude and at some of the PGA Tour’s tighter courses, such as Harbour Town and Silverado.
2557	2557	23	23	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Many believe the elevation of the course this week will have it play similar to Crans-sur-Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters, which Noren has won twice including last year. Noren has three top 25 finishes in four starts so far this season but could add some value in your Fantasy team in a strong field this week in Mexico. Those are our picks, now it’s time to make yours.
4565	4565	31	31	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday. Martin Kaymer – $7,300  Martin Kaymer will be the most popular player this week and he is still a staple for me in cash and GPP lineups.
6825	6825	11	11	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His scoring average in 18 competitive rounds here is 67.67. Trey Mullinax … Every rookie should be inspired by Xander Schauffele's victory at The Greenbrier Classic, but Mullinax has a unique connection to the first-time winner in that both were in the conversation on the weekend at the U.S. Open where they posted top 10s to earn exemptions into the 2018 edition. Mullinax's path began the week prior when he finished T18 at the FedEx St. Jude Classic, but his arc since includes a measurable improvement with his approach game.
10216	10216	45	46	target: Ollie Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However 20th for Birdie Average, 21st for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion and 28th for All-Round on the PGA Tour season to date, plus 10th position in my 10-week Putting Average tracker, highlights a Torrey Pines specialist you simply can't ignore this week. RESULT: T8  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places EW, 1/5):  As Barry O'Hanrahan stated in this week's Farmers/Dubai podcast , younger players on the PGA Tour will take note that Jon Rahm won his first PGA Tour title here 12 months ago. That kind of extra motivation could prove the final piece of the jigsaw for talented non-winners this week and Ollie Schniederjans fits that category perfectly.
8683	8683	8	8	target: Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required. An undoubted talent, Na might not trouble the winner's interviewer nearly enough, but at 64th in the OWGR and 40th in the FedEx Cup series, the Las Vegas man will be gunning for a top 5 finish this week to grab a coveted East Lake spot. He has previous with this back in 2015 when he travelled to Chicago in 34th spot in the FEC standings.
9944	9944	29	29	target: Stuard 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stuard’s only Tour win came at the 2016 Zurich Classic, which was shortened to 54-holes due to heavy rainfall. Whilst this is a win as much as any other, Stuard will be keen to prove himself a winner over four rounds and with the start he has made to this season, this may well be the year. This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open.
1874	1874	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson 22/1 (Betfair and PaddyPower) 1.5pts e/w:  I picked Mickelson to win last week and I am going to chance him again, despite the shorter odds. Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly.
5621	5621	40	40	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will come into play a lot more than on a regular course, because putting will be neutralized a bit with just getting to greens being a struggle. Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy.
8147	8147	52	53	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has the pressure of attempting to become the youngest ever player to win the career grand slam following his Open Championship success last month. It would be extremely daft to write him off but others are preferred at the prices and the one I really like is last week's winner, Hideki Matsuyama. When Matsuyama hits form he tends to stay in form and with course form figures reading an improving 38-20-11, he looks the most solid of the market leaders.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
5860	5860	30	30	target: "Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dave Tindall, who tipped 40/1 US Open winner Brooks Koepka in last week's Each-Way column, looks for more profits in his preview of this week's PGA Tour event in Connecticut...  "Lahiri shot 69-65 on the weekend at Muirfield Village three weeks ago so will be chomping at the bit to get going again." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places      Wesley Bryan, Russell Knox, Jhonattan Vegas, Billy Hurley III, Branden Grace and Davis Love III. What unites them?
4087	4087	28	29	target: Rafael Campos 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week we find a standout in a golfer who I have been very intrigued by over the last few weeks. A staple on the Latin American tour Rafael Campos has made over $100,000 in each of the past two seasons in only two events on the PGA Tour. Campos is quickly raising my eyebrows this year however as he continues to make cuts in a string of gutsy performances.
9705	9705	18	18	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As far as recent performance goes Woodland has made seven straight cuts dating back to last season. Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th.

648	648	10	10	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - RBC Heritage - 2.5ew Kisner 28/1; 2ew Fitzpatrick 35/1, 2ew Henley 25/1
3442	3442	9	10	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson ($11,300) – He’s the best in the world, and I dare you to overthink it and fade him. His superior combination of indomitable length, wedge play, putting, and supreme “relaxation” (or whatever you want to call it) on the golf course make him the ultimate grind machine on tough tracks.
2024	2024	38	39	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the top 5s won’t happen every week, Rose is coming off a T6 finish here last year, and oh by the way, he’s currently leading the PGA in strokes gained tee-to-green, scoring average, and pre-cut scoring average. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – That’s right, I’m hopping back in the Jimmy horse. He might’ve kicked me off twice already this season, but COME ON!
2802	2802	1	2	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
7521	7521	25	25	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics. Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts. Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week.
9270	9270	14	15	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan a couple of weeks ago with 20-under. Brooks Koepka loves a low one and he jumps off the page here. With a win (Japan) and a second (WGC-HSBC in China) in his last two starts, he's in cruise control mode and, although his price has been nibbled at, I'm happy to take 9/1.
12304	12304	21	22	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'd expect the eventual semi-finalist to come from the bottom half of the quarter though and to that end I'm backing Patrick Reed to be the player to prevail. Opponents Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel have both been off the boil of late - the Chinese star has finished outside of the top-50 on each of his starts since winning in Dubai and the former Masters Champion hasn't managed a top-10 globally since June of last year - which leaves Jordan Spieth as Reed's biggest challenge. Of course Spieth is well capable of finding the putting form that saw him rise to the top of the world rankings back in 2015-2016, however the process changes he's been making with the flat stick are yet to bed in fully and that leaves the door open for an aggressive player like Patrick Reed to take full advantage.
12206	12206	29	29	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Englishman has yet to win on American soil, but this could be the week Fleetwood proves himself worthy of a top-10 spot in the OWGR. Glue Guys    Marc Leishman - $14,800    Leishman crushed it on the par-fives at Bay Hill en route to his victory at the API last year, and although he doesn’t own impeccable recent form as of late, a sub-$15K price tag shouldn’t go unnoticed for the No. 16 ranked player in the OWGR.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2769	2769	19	20	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook. Graham DeLaet and Kevin Na. Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook.
3483	3483	1	1	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Notably, Mickelson would have to be the first of the last 19 winners to win here a year after missing the cut. That particular trend doesn’t bother me in Mickelson’s respect, with the three-time Green Jacket winner having a clear affinity with this course. That missed cut last year was just his third in 24 appearances at Augusta and as such I believe it was almost an anomaly.
785	785	18	18	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Ian Wilkerson - Wells Fargo - 2ew Simpson 40-1, Rahm 12-1; 1.5ew Casey 22-1; 1ew Swafford 66-1, JT Poston 110-1
8026	8026	64	64	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is still hard at this point to predict the winning score this week, given the series of changes made to the course but he has had the goods here in the past and the majority of the course will be the same as it has been in the past. A 4th here last year suggests the change to Bermuda greens did not bother Fowler, and I struggle to see this week panning out without him involved over the weekend. With Matsuyama, McIlroy and Spieth looking so strong, it is hard for anyone to topple them but Fowler is one player that is certainly capable of doing just that.
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
6326	6326	4	5	target: Smylie Kaufman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value picks (below $7500):  Smylie Kaufman ($7000) – The LSU product has been having some success recently, with four top-35 finishes in his last six official events, and has better form off the tee than his overall ranking suggests. Kaufman still struggles to find the fairway with the driver, but should easily get there if he clubs down, and he’s above average from the 175-200 range which is a big plus this week. He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently.
6513	6513	45	46	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s going to be plenty of bogeys this week, so we need birdies to offset the damages. The top-10 in this field in recent birdie or better percentage are Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson, Tony Finau, Stewart Cink, Kevin Streelman, Grayson Murray, Boo Weekley, James Hahn, Patrick Reed, and Xander Schauffele. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Patrick Reed ($11,200)  This guy is going to win, and he’s going to win soon.
355	355	15	15	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get to say it on the pod, but don't sleep on PXG Perez or Molinari this week. Sign me up for both!
2774	2774	34	35	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 DraftKings Valspar Tips  This tournament is one where it often gets overlooked, but the course is tough and it takes a week of good ball striking to win here. This week I think Bill Haas is going to come away with the victory. Close here last year, but he often goes under-owned when he shouldn’t.
7998	7998	1	2	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For Rickie Fowler, it was the scene of his first win on Tour in 2012 while he was T6 on debut in 2010 and also fourth in 2016. The change of greens from Bentgrass to Bermuda should hardly work against Fowler either. His win this season (which helped get him through all the statistical checks) came in Florida and he's a proven performer on Bermuda.
5970	5970	9	9	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open. But what really spurs the Thomas pick is his experience at River Highlands, shooting a 62 last year to finish T-3.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
6358	6358	17	17	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have a feeling this is the week, when everyone has finally given up on him. Kyle Stanley – $7,600  Stanley was one of the most popular plays last week on DraftKings and didn’t quite come through with his T57 finish. He is now $1,000 cheaper, which is likely keep his ownership relatively high, but I think the general public will be off of Stanley.
3177	3177	61	62	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the 2013 renewal was a fortnight prior to Augusta, it was still the final port of call for most of the big names in the field and they were to a man outdone by DA Points. In 2008, it was Johnson Wagner and his local connections which upset the apple cart and while Paul Casey, Anthony Kim, Hunter Mahan and Phil Mickelson represent more obvious champions, it's pretty clear that this event has been somewhat hard to predict. Of those mentioned, Stenson and Mickelson look sure to play well and it was interesting to note the latter's comments in last week's Match Play, which convince me that he's worth having on-side despite Houston's in-built volatility.
9478	9478	2	2	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Patrick Cantlay  Ladies and gents, meet the next generation’s Paul Casey. Albeit delayed a few years due to injury, Cantlay burst on the PGA scene in 2018 with all of the composure of a long-time veteran, making the cut in literally every event he played (13/13) with eight top-25 finishes and four top-tens.
8405	8405	3	3	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Four years later, Moore returned to Bethpage and finished T7 and just three shots shy of winner, Patrick Reed. Not only does Moore have form at Bethpage, he has also shown a liking for Augusta National in the past. Moore played Augusta twice as an amateur, finishing T45 in 2003 before returning in 2005 where he finished T13 and took the Low Amateur honours.
9620	9620	19	20	target: Kevin Kisner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All three courses - Harbour Town, Sea Island and Colonial - represent good form pointers for the Sony Open. Kevin Kisner: Worth backing in Hawaii  Kisner's record here reflects his career trajectory. For years he struggled, and then something clicked as he opened with a round of 63 en route to fifth in 2016, before going one place better after a closing 65 last year.
4363	4363	30	30	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
10436	10436	23	24	target: Harris English, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price. Harris English, $8500 – About halfway down the salary list we see English, and no, this is not a misinterpretation. But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough.
8952	8952	37	38	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Branden Grace swing sequence:  This will be the eighth time the CIMB Classic has featured on the PGA Tour. Ben Crane was the winner in 2010 and, since then, Bo Van Pelt, Nick Watney, Ryan Moore and Justin Thomas have been champions. In 2014, Moore successfully defended the title he first won in 2013.
1359	1359	4	4	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@WMPhoenixOpen Picks Berger 40 Chappell 66 Hoffman 66 Piercy 75 Ollie 80 *Fowler 16 w. Patriots ML (-175) al… https://t.co/tlRzw6qW6U
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
2623	2623	1	1	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
6881	6881	36	36	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore ranked 34th for DD and 12th for DA. Jordan Spieth, who is missing the tournament for the second year in-a-row, has won two of the last four renewals because he's scrambled and putted brilliantly and Moore ranked first for Scrambling and sixth for Putting Average, but the secret to success here is usually relentlessly finding the putting surfaces. Greens In Regulation is the most important stat but how you play the par fives is key too.
7589	7589	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not only is there a lack of top talent besides DJ, but the ownership projects on the golfers in the $8K range is down right criminal. Currently, Kevin Chappell has seven tags on FanShareSports, which doesn’t even come close to the golfers priced ahead of him. Chappell arguably a top five golfer in this field, but is will likely come in at under 10% ownership.
1708	1708	21	21	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Three further top-4 finishes at the CareerBuilder, WGC Cadillac and the Wells Fargo were enough to ensure a very solid year. Mickelson will be desperate to get back in the winners’ circle and this is the place for him to do so. He doesn’t stand out statistically but he must be doing something right, looking at his current form.
5094	5094	31	32	target: Jason Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After his recent missed cut (one of the few he’s had all year) I suspect he will fall off of most peoples radars. Another golfer in a very similar situation is Jason Dufner, who is well publicized to have worked heavily on his putting game all off season and it seems to be showing. It seems with his added putting skill the regular 45th place finishes of 2016 are starting to become top 25 finishes with some real upside mixed into the fold.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
5536	5536	12	12	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Add to this his ranking of 38th in Stroked Gained: Around-the-Green and Kisner ranks an impressive 5th in Strokes Gained: Total. Kisner also ranks 12th in Driving Accuracy, but ranking just 132nd in Driving Distance (286.4 yards) meant his Total Driving ranking couldn’t be any better than 32nd. Distance isn’t everything, and for someone of Kisner’s accuracy off the tee, his relative lack of power isn’t too much of a concern.
2955	2955	53	54	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After returning from a lengthy lay-off to finish T7 in Mexico last week, Rory will want to continue his build towards Augusta and he'll view top 10 here as a minimum. Last four events: 7-2-9-4  Course form: 27-11  Florida form: 12-27-3-MC-8-11-9-MC-6-25-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 14%, Top 5: 46%, Top 10: 64%    Henrik Stenson  As suspected, Stenson quickly recovered from his WD in Mexico (food poisoning) to extend his run of top 10s to six (in completed events at least) with T7 in last week's Valspar Championship. This is an event he should have won in 2015 (three-putted 15 and 16 when on the clock) and either side of that second place he made the top five in 2014 and 2016 so this really is a great course for him.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
13553	13553	6	6	target: Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That leaves me with Steele and Hoffman. Hoffman grades out better in total course history, current form, and is only slightly worse in long-term performance. I will go with Charley Hoffman this week.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
7471	7471	14	14	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two of the last three winners here coming off of good Open Championships, Kuchar looks to be in a prime position to take down a weaker field. Charley Hoffman ($10,300): For many of the reasons we have to like Matt Kuchar this week, we also have to like Charley Hoffman. Hoffman played well at the Open, finishing T20, and hasn’t missed the weekend in any of his last nine starts.
12186	12186	20	21	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark. In 14 starts here, he's backed five top-10 finishes, missing the cut only once, and it was encouraging to see a return to bermuda provoke an improved putting display when he finished 14th at the Valspar Championship last week.
934	934	1	2	target: Jamie Lovemark 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had Jamie Lovemark matched at 45/1 in the #RSMClassic. This looks a big opportunity for him to win his first… https://t.co/n12NsBcNp2
13594	13594	15	15	target: Steele, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s take a look at options for your cash lineup this week in Texas. Brendan Steele, $8900 – Steele missed the cut at the Masters, ending a solid start to the 2018 season. There’s hope that the MC will lower ownership, but more than likely, folks will be on the Steele bandwagon and for good reason.
11112	11112	5	6	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My selections are as follows:  Justin Thomas 3pts EW 11/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  At the very top of the market, I don't like Rickie Fowler this week who's extremely short and has up until this point had a horrid time when it comes to defending his all too infrequent victories. I'm sure Rory McIlroy will be popular on a course where he's won and finished runner-up in the very near past.
9666	9666	47	47	target: Stroud, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton Kizzire, who won the aforementioned OHL Classic nicely in November missed the cut on debut 12 months ago and he didn't put brilliantly last week when finishing 15th but I thought [85.0] was juicy enough for him. And finally, I've thrown a few pounds at Chris Stroud, who's vigorous preparations for last week's event paid off when he finished 11th. Stroud played courses with slow greens to ready himself for last week and it worked as he ranked second for Putting Average.
7343	7343	15	16	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That sounds right up Matsuyama's alley. EXPERT JONATHAN WALL , Equipment Insider LINEUP | BENCH Jordan Spieth  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Adam Scott  Sergio Garcia  Dustin Johnson  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth Spieth will embrace the difficult test this week at Royal Birkdale. Doesn't hurt that he recorded a win in his previous start.
909	909	18	19	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
7537	7537	32	32	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
2363	2363	17	18	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All of them placed inside the top 6 last year here. FTW I’m going to go with Adam Scott ($12,200) as my put a gun to my head pick. Fades:  Last Week’s Results: Bubba MC’d, and naturally Laird was a top 10… what a surprise.
7610	7610	8	8	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag.
639	639	122	123	target: Daniel Berger; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley. Winners & Prices : 2016: McIlroy 13/2 ; 2015: Spieth 9/1 ; 2014: Horschel 25/1 ; 2013: Stenson 16/1 ; 2012: Snedeker 40/1 ; 2011: Haas 45/1 ; 2010: Furyk 20/1 ; Average: 23/1.
6427	6427	40	40	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look at previous winners here and it's noticeable that Danny Lee was a runner-up in Puerto Rico back in 2014 and Angel Cabrera finished 7th there in 2011. If the confidence continues with the flat stick there's no reason why DeChambeau doesn't feature this week. Result: T14  Smylie Kaufman 0.5pt EW 150/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  5th as recently as Eagle Point, I also think that Smylie Kaufman is worth a speculative punt at a big price, especially at a tournament where shock results seem normal.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
3580	3580	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks seventh on the tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and putts per round. His spot in a pool with Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia will help temper ownership despite his play. O'Hair has made the cut four out of six tries at August National and in seven of his past nine tour events.
766	766	7	7	target: Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is the ideal test for Bohn right now as he looks for a return to form. He has made just 6 of 15 cuts since returning, and his best finish was T35. The trouble is Bohn has struggled, understandably since suffering a heart attack at the Honda Classic last year.
13055	13055	37	38	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another. I can definitely see Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson being part of the picture too so will back both for top 10s at [2.88] and [2.84] respectively. Both can play this course in their sleep and I want to cash in on their combination of experience and impressive recent form.
10708	10708	12	13	target: Sam Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only two months removed from a co-runner-up performance at his national open. Sam Saunders … It's always notable whenever any golfer deep in the Web.com Tour reshuffle category (in which he's positioned 39th) sits out an event on the West Coast Swing as he did at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, but with a T25 at Waialae and a T8 in the Coachella Valley to lead off the restart of the season, he built a foundation to sustain a regular schedule for the remainder. It also bought him a two-week recharge for his eighth appearance on the Monterey Peninsula.
192	192	27	27	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of others who could play a part in what looks a fascinating week but, at the prices, I like my trio of Reed (50/1), Watson (40/1) and Koepka (30/1). Koepka's recent putting stats are impressive (he's 10th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season) and when you put everything together he's capable of landing the title on his course debut. That should give the Californian the extra incentive to seal it in style and the other way of looking at it is that he may just feel a little more relaxed than some of the others who are the wrong side of the line and chasing.
669	669	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott has been one of the hottest golfers in the world over the past month. It’s been several months since this Aussie last notched a podium finish on the PGA Tour, but we can’t be too disappointed with three consecutive fourths to open the FedEx Cup playoffs. Needless to say, Scott will bring plenty of momentum into this week, which should give him a fighting chance against the Days and Spieths of the world.
6604	6604	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, this course has historically had scores finish in the teens under par. Cash Game Plays  Tony Finau ($16,200) – Finau just pops off the page at me with his odds and price. MILTON (Yes that is his real first name) is playing excellent golf and his ball striking is on FIRE.
12855	12855	8	8	target: Hadwin’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But most of it has to do with Hadwin’s elite iron play the past six weeks. Hadwin is averaging 5.3 strokes gained on his approaches over his last three starts, good for finishes of T6, T9 and T12. And the best part, like Spieth, is that he’s putting like garbage, losing strokes in four of his past five turns.
4803	4803	19	20	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watch (Or Listen) to the show and you’ll get the full skinny. A-List: Graeme McDowell & Marc Leishman  B-List: Paul Casey, Jordan Spieth, Kevin Kisner & William McGirt  C-List: Nick Taylor & Kyle Stanley  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between. You can watch the Pat Mayo Hour every weekday at noon, 3:00pm EST, 8:00pm EST and Midnight on the FNTSY Sports Network Television channel or on your Apple TV, Xbox, Roku or Amazon Fire Stick.
11078	11078	16	17	target: Lucas Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Knox at 45/1 could also be a strong bet but I'll side with RCB. Outsider: Back Lucas Glover EW @ 150/1  We've done well with the long-shots in recent weeks with 200/1 Scott Stallings grabbing full each-way return at Pebble Beach and 100/1 Martin Laird missing out on a place by a single shot at Riviera. So let's try another triple-figure punt with 150/1 chance Lucas Glover.
2838	2838	10	11	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Read below for my winner, chalk and sleepers. Predicted Winner: Bill Haas  Chalky players: Kevin Na, Dufner, Graham DeLaet and Luke Donald. Sleepers: Steve Stricker and Charley Hoffman  Hidden Sleeper I didn't mention in my video: Ollie Schniederjans
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
2700	2700	51	51	target: Furyk’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Those factors are in play again here at Copperhead, where he’s made the weekend on every visit bar his 2004 debut, won in 2010, lost a play-off in 2012, and has since finished seventh, 20th and 40th. Unsurprisingly, he’s called this course one of his favourites and I’ve seen enough in Furyk’s play not just last year but over the last few weeks to believe he can get competitive. Chris Kirk’s long game looks to have come good at a nice time given that he’s a Georgia man who is not currently in the Masters and it’ll be interesting to see if he can press on and first secure a place first in the WGC-Match Play which is coming up.
8186	8186	13	13	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We estimate his ownership to fall between 26 – 30%. Value Plays:  Adam Scott $8,600 – Scott is another guy who performed well last week with three rounds in the 60’s, and has always been a premier ball striker. He ranks high in this field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his Vegas odds to win are better or the same as Stenson, Garcia, Thomas, and Kuchar.
8041	8041	25	26	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting a young player with a huge amount of talent, who is still yet to reach the peak of his potential. Zach Johnson 80/1 (Ladbrokes 6 places ¼ odds Betfair 8 places 1/5 odds) 1pt e/w:  Like Fowler I am also sticking with Zach Johnson for the second major in a row. The two-time major winner played well enough at Birkdale (14th) before finishing 2nd behind a ridiculously impressive, Matsuyama at Firestone.
1696	1696	46	47	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All kidding aside it is testament to this event that so many fans and players turn up here year-on-year given the clash in schedule. ADVERTISEMENT  Three of the last five winners have been straight out the top drawer with Hideki Matsuyama (2016), Brooks Koepka (2015) and Phil Mickelson (2013) winning in recent years. Whilst Koepka wasn’t a surprise winner, it was still his maiden win and as a result three of the last five winners have also been first-time PGA Tour winners.
4126	4126	8	9	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
12478	12478	35	35	target: Hossler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a native Californian it’s not surprising that Beau cooled off a bit once the tour reached Florida however I am hoping that a trip to his adopted home state of Texas will reignite things. Hossler had a stellar career at the University of Texas and in 2017 he received a sponsors exemption in to the field of this week’s event. Beau rewarded this exemption by finishing 39th.
12489	12489	36	36	target: Reavie, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This year's Phoenix Open winner, Gary Woodland, doesn't frank the form particularly well. In his sole appearance in this event, he could only finish 33rd but the man he beat in the playoff in Phoenix, Chez Reavie, finished seventh here in his only appearance back in 2016. And that's especially pertinent given Reavie only managed three top-tens all year in 2016 and he was out of form when he finished seventh here.
334	334	1	2	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Dustin Johnson — D.J. doesn’t have a whole lot to show for himself at TPC Boston, but it’s hard to dislike a guy who has enjoyed the season he’s had.
1061	1061	6	6	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some interesting prices out there. Stewgoat Cink at $6800 will prob bankrupt me
7237	7237	60	60	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He added a further T10 in the Open de France at the start of July but either side missed the cut in the U.S. Open and also when defending in Scotland last week. Those two results aren't ideal but I prefer to look at the bigger picture which shows Noren sat at No.9 in the world rankings above Fowler, Koepka, Rose, Thomas and others that are higher on many punters' radars. One obvious negative thrown at Noren is his poor record in the majors and the bare facts don't look great.
4741	4741	12	12	target: Kang 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously, his stellar recent form has lead to some pretty impressive statistics. Kang ranks inside the top 30 for this field in all of the strokes gained stats other than around the green. He scores very well on Par 4s and is a very solid birdie maker.
1505	1505	10	11	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s a tough one to call so approach with caution. Bill Haas 20/1  Bill Haas has had a decent start to the season with four top 20 finishes in his last four starts. He started with a respectable T20 at the Safeway Open and followed that with a T4 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China where he didnt shoot worse than a 70 throughout the week to finish 15 under for the tournament.
275	275	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Genesis Open Bets: Outright: DJ Scott E/W: Casey Grace Pieters English Long Shot: Donald FRL: List
1554	1554	10	10	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Genesis Open - 2ew Chappell 50-1; 4win Johnson 5-1; 1ew Rodgers 125-1, Cantlay 50-1 #GenesisOpen
11363	11363	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
877	877	0	1	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Aaron Wise winner on Web Tour &amp; T10 at TPC Summerlin 12 months ago. Birdie machine who will relish Shriners Open. https://t.co/zLqcf7SOnY
10330	10330	16	16	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Bill Haas ($7,000). His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000.
13376	13376	22	22	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play. Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G.
13627	13627	29	29	target: Fleetwood's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a correlating course perspective, his 4th at PGA National in February works very nicely with the likes of previous winners here Fowler and McIlroy being Honda Classic champions. Fleetwood's 2 Abu Dhabi successes also make sense with Quail victors Woods (3rd 2012), McIlroy (4 runner-up spots) and Fowler (1st 2016) all having success at Abu Dhabi Golf Club. You can even look at Tommy's 2nd at the 2017 WGC played at Chapultepec in a positive way with 2018 winner and runner-up Phil Mickelson and Justin Thomas not having a bad record at Quail Hollow.
2079	2079	1	2	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Bill Haas -- Haas is a great pick this week, and not just as a horse-for-course. He hasn't finished outside of the top 20 in any start this season.
827	827	7	7	target: HADWIN 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
10185	10185	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Next Best: Back Tony Finau e.w. @ 33/1  Tony Finau's record in the majors - T10, T14, T18 and T27 in just seven played - shows that he likes and can play well in tough conditions. With single digits under par winning three of the last four Farmers Insurance Opens, Finau will get the sort of test he likes and, indeed, Torrey Pines is right up his street in many ways.
3478	3478	50	50	target: Holmes’ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It took a final round 68 to shoot up the leaderboard here last year, but 74 was his worst round of the week showing he played four pretty steady rounds on this tough course. With soft conditions possible, after heavy rain Monday which may be followed with more on Thursday, Holmes’ distance off the tee could be vital. Holmes missed his first cut since last August in Houston last week, but he wasn’t alone, with players such as Spieth, Adam Scott and Patrick Reed also missing the cut in what was a strange, weather-affected Houston Open.
1671	1671	13	13	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 3ew Thomas 12-1; 1ew Kisner 60-1, Kaymer 70-1 #HondaClassic
12200	12200	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
10021	10021	37	37	target: Armour 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stuard is 6 for 6 in cuts made on the season with three Top 10’s and Flores is 4 for 5 in cuts made with some decent success here. Sample Line-Up  Reed – Mickelson – Stuard – Armour – Flores – Martin  Fade of the Week  Webb Simpson  After choosing Cam Smith for the TOC who placed 17th of 34 players and CHIII last week who placed 32nd I try my luck at choosing another good fade play. Webb Simpson will be very high owned this week as it seems he has found his putting stroke.
11958	11958	26	27	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When 3rd here in 2014, Scott ranked 14th in SG: Putting, and that will be the sort of ranking he will need to achieve this week. Zach Johnson 66/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Zach Johnson has quietly been playing very solidly in 2018 and he looks to be returning to something close to winning form. Johnson has finished inside the top-23 in six of his seven starts this season, with the T57 finish at the Phoenix Open the exception.
13156	13156	41	41	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey won the Valspar Championship last month, his first main Tour victory since 2014, and we all know about Phil Mickelson's 5 year drought ending with a cracking victory at the WGC-Mexico Championship the week before Casey's victory. So in Simpson we have a 4-time PGA Tour winner who hasn't won since October 2013. Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one.
735	735	31	32	target: Martin Laird, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Chris Kirk, Nick Watney. 1 - Sang-moon Bae; Jonas Blixt, Jonathan Byrd, Bryson DeChambeau, Luke Donald, Ernie Els, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Billy Hurley III, Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox, Martin Laird, David Lingmerth, Hunter Mahan, Ben Martin, Troy Merritt, Kevin Na, Geoff Ogilvy, Rod Pampling, Ted Potter Jnr, Rory Sabbatini, Vijay Singh, Scott Stallings, Kevin Streelman, Camilo Villegas. Course experience here is an important factor but course debutants shouldn't be overlooked either.
11545	11545	59	60	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
10979	10979	26	27	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not too strict, but definitely helps avoid the golfers that should be reserved for GPPs only:  Sangmoon Bae  Tom Hoge  K.J. Choi  Jonas Blixt  The Specialists  Jason Kokrak  Chez Reavie  Vaughn Taylor  Keegan Bradley  Jimmy Walker  The specialist this week is Jason Kokrak! This masher finished T34-79-MC-T41 in his first four trips to Riviera CC.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
3415	3415	8	9	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler at 22/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Bill Haas at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Marc Leishman at 66/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w.
2043	2043	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great value at his price considering he has the 4th best Vegas odds but only the 7th most expensive player on the board. Mid Range Picks  Patrick Reed ($8,300)  Reed is absurdly underpriced. He’s a consistent cut-maker with a solid track record here.
10731	10731	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because his short game is so good, he doesn’t have to contend with length off the tee as an obstacle. Reed could pop here; his problem is usually a lackluster Saturday. If he holds steady on Saturday, look out Sunday!
5688	5688	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Worth a GPP team or 2. Matt Kuchar $7,600 – In a tournament that demands mental strength I will want some of the old guy who has been there, done that and doesn’t get too rattled. He also has made the cut (46-12-12-28) the last 4 years.
1869	1869	43	43	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite struggling last week, Reed will be looking to build on the 6th place finish at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the Career Builder Challenge he has accumulated so far in 2017. Another notable in the field this week is Phil Mickelson who is a four-time Pebble Beach winner. Mickelson has not finished outside the top-21 so far this season and finished T16 in Phoenix last week.
10129	10129	10	10	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So why not use the CareerBuilder as a tune-up? Beyond Rahm, Brian Harman, on the heel of his recent HOT FIYA run, is the only other member of the world’s top 20 in the CareerBuilder field. Failing to convert another 36-hole lead at the Sony Open, the 3-foot-7 Harman is one of 10 players teeing it up for the third consecutive week to begin the year.
4990	4990	13	13	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also 27th in SGT2G, T30 in ball striking, 37th in P4P. Chris Kirk - $8,200    Until a couple of weeks ago, this is not a pick we would've made and still may be a gamble. However, Kirk tied for 12th at The Players, giving him his first top-20 since November (yes, November).
9554	9554	16	16	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last season, Smith was ranked eighth on the PGA Tour in putting average. Long-Shot Values    Bryson DeChambeau - $7,000 (60-1)    DeChambeau notched three top-20s in the fall season. He ranks 41st in proximity so far this season.
10538	10538	44	45	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Time to rebound this week in the desert. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Hideki Matsuyama (T4-T2-WIN-WIN)  J.J. Spaun (T4)  Webb Simpson (6-for-7 with five top 15s)  Rickie Fowler (7-for-9 with three top 5s)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T9)  Byeong Hun An (6th)  Zach Johnson (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Shane Lowry (T6-T16)  Jon Rahm (T5-T16)  Brendan Steele (7-for-7 with five Top 20s)  Phil Mickelson (22-for-28 with THREE WINS)  Kevin Na (11-for-12 with eight top 30s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-8 with two top 10s)  Bubba Watson (9-for-11 with six top 15s)  Daniel Berger (T10-T58-T7)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Matt Kuchar  Justin Thomas  Phil Mickelson  Marc Leishman  Francesco Molinari  Brandt Snedeker  Austin Cook  Steve Stricker  Zach Johnson  Patrick Reed  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, and Daniel Berger.
3178	3178	24	25	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2008, it was Johnson Wagner and his local connections which upset the apple cart and while Paul Casey, Anthony Kim, Hunter Mahan and Phil Mickelson represent more obvious champions, it's pretty clear that this event has been somewhat hard to predict. Of those mentioned, Stenson and Mickelson look sure to play well and it was interesting to note the latter's comments in last week's Match Play, which convince me that he's worth having on-side despite Houston's in-built volatility. When asked about Augusta, Mickelson was keen to stress that he has another event to play first and, considering how confident he's become in his game of late, he expects to contend.
9507	9507	12	13	target: Pat Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good value at the top of the board this week. Pat Perez ($8,000) – Ever since Pat Perez returned from his shoulder surgery when he “stayed sane by drinking a lot of booze and eating a lot of food,” he’s been a completely different player. Since his return, he has won two PGA events and jumped his way up to 19th in the world (he was ranked 118th at the end of 2016).
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
1478	1478	22	23	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$10million+ Salary Players :  Positive: We have 6 players over the $10 million threshold this week which is something new for 2017. Bill Haas takes some beating from a consistency level - he's Mr PGA West - and although the move to a tricky Pete Dye Stadium Course has not helped the Carolinian in any sense, you would be crazy to leave him out of your roster if you want a +$10m spear-head. Zach Johnson is the other that appeals to me on the basis he made 21 birdies and an eagle last week, in what was far and away his best PGA Tour outing since the 2015 Barclays tournament.
9125	9125	21	22	target: Webb Simpson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 5 of the predictor are Webb Simpson, Ryan Moore, Chesson Hadley, Kevin Streelman and Tony Finau. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Northern Trust / Made in Denmark tournaments and includes PGA Tour, European Tour and web.com Playoff events.
2563	2563	0	0	target: Jordan’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan’s 72.2 percent Recent GIR is 16th, and his 17.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for fourth among golfers who have made more than two starts the past six weeks. Spieth also played well at the WGC events last season, finishing T7, T17, T9, and T3. The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance.
6350	6350	1	1	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Taylor – GPP Punt – DK: $6700 FD: $5400  Maybe it’s my Canadian bias coming through but here’s another Canadian that sets up for any par 70 course. For me, Taylor stands out to me in the range of players in the bottom few $100 of salary. Our VIP Spreadsheet shows Taylor gaining strokes to the field Tee-to-Green which is huge anytime you can get a punt play who is doing that.
4474	4474	3	3	target: Henley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well.
1005	1005	5	6	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge! If you want to win at DraftKings daily fantasy golf, you have to figure out a way to find six golfers that play all 72 holes and earn roughly 85 points each.
7390	7390	32	33	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To say the least, this course is definitely a bit of a bomber’s paradise. Obviously, this is not to say that shorter hitters won’t be able to jump all over it – Matt Kuchar has destroyed this course the past three times he’s played it – but if you have limited penalty for missing the fairway with short Par 5s and bentgrass greens, that’s pretty much the green light special for your favorite big hitters. Let’s jump into some picks.
10733	10733	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk. Kirk is always a solid putter and relies on his irons, so take some GPP shares of Kirk this week.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
3174	3174	30	30	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last week's performance in Puerto Rico was a little disappointing in some respects, given that he'd put together successive top-25 finishes in much deeper fields previously, but it looks like Lee just didn't get anything going on the greens and it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. On his last start in this event, Lee missed the cut but a second-round 66 contained eight birdies and just one mistake, a costly double-bogey. Just two players in the field bettered his Friday score and he was very close to undoing the damage of round one.
202	202	46	46	target: Koepka's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That should give the Californian the extra incentive to seal it in style and the other way of looking at it is that he may just feel a little more relaxed than some of the others who are the wrong side of the line and chasing. Koepka's recent putting stats are impressive (he's 10th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season) and when you put everything together he's capable of landing the title on his course debut. There are plenty of others who could play a part in what looks a fascinating week but, at the prices, I like my trio of Reed (50/1), Watson (40/1) and Koepka (30/1).
1133	1133	20	21	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will he just be turning up for a whack or could he shoot the lights out with no pressure on? Jordan Spieth - 11/2    Spieth won this by 10 shots when it was played at Isleworth in 2015, finishing 26 shots in front of last-placed Tiger. When defending at Albany, this week's venue, last year the two-time major winner shot rounds of 67-66-68-67 to finish solo fourth, five back from Bubba.
12833	12833	38	38	target: Thomas's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Besides which, if he makes the turn on Sunday in contention for a green jacket, I can't imagine that the prospect of reaching world number one will be anywhere near the front of his mind. Ultimately, I believe Thomas's play over the last year makes him the man to beat, and I expect him to improve on his Masters form and demonstrate that his is an ideal game for Augusta National. Should he do that, he won't be far away and nobody is as good at winning right now.
13015	13015	42	42	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Great results across both Emirates Golf Club - 8th (2016), 3rd (2017) and 3rd (2018) and Crans-sur-Sierre - 3rd (2014), 3rd (2015) and 3rd (2017) tie in well with the last 2 winners here in Garcia and Willett, but I also like Hatton for his strong links with St Andrews as Augusta winners Tiger Woods, Zach Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia all have excellent records at the Home of Golf, as does 2016 champion Danny Willett. So getting on board the 2016 and 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links winner Hatton makes lots of sense to me at a rather tasty price. Hatton is currently available at a market-leading 80/1 with Ladbrokes if you prefer .
585	585	37	38	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Spieth needs a win and some help to win the FedEx Cup, and while he may have had a “disappointing” season by his standards, it wouldn’t surprise me to see him repeat come Sunday night. Mid Tier  Paul Casey (9,500)  Casey is the one who has played himself into a top 5 spot by finishing runner-up in the last 2 Playoff events. Casey has only played East Lake twice, finishing 4th and 5th.
2929	2929	15	15	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I love those types of golf courses that reward good golf but punish sloppy play." Rose won Memorial in 2010 (his first PGA Tour victory) and you know he'd be a fitting winner and would say all the right things if he were to win the first running of the tournament since Arnie passed. Already on Twitter, he's posted: "The most important follow this week... @APinv #TheKing."
11455	11455	31	31	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can just roll it at an average pace, like he did at this track last year, the reigning Masters champ will be near the top of the leaderboard. Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly.
1429	1429	0	1	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak is $6900 on DK and is averaging 69 points over his last 7 events. All in.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10	10	37	38	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And so, I'm taking a guy who doesn't own a great track record here -- just one career top-10 against a bunch of missed cuts -- but has played some inspired golf this year. Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009.
4268	4268	1	1	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harold Varner III ($6300): To afford a player like Jon Rahm, it’s necessary to squeeze in one of the cheaper players with upside, and Varner fits that to a tee. Although he’s not currently the longest hitter on Tour, Varner sits T45 in Carry Distance and in the past has been known for his distance. The “Dab King” averages 3.74 birdies and converts birdie or better on 16.03% of approach shots between 150-175 yards.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
261	261	19	20	target: CHEZ REAVIE 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Guys I might not have on DraftKings but bet them because I like their odds: NICK TAYLOR (585/1) and CHEZ REAVIE (450/1). ⛳️
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
6102	6102	12	12	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All three of these guys are typically mid to upper 7k range. Hadwin hasn’t been “stellar” but seems to always make the cut. Lee and Taylor have been a bit hotter lately and I like their birdie potential.
5462	5462	4	5	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Piercy ($8,500)  9. Phil Mickelson ($10,200)  11. Francesco Molinari ($10,500)  Recommended Lineup  Francesco Molinari: $10,500  Molinari finished second at the BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour in his most recent action.
12654	12654	23	23	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t make this stuff up. Still, despite bleeding strokes to the field on the putting surfaces in four of his past six starts, List has piled up six consecutive Top 30s, with two Top-10 paydays. It’s about getting to the green for List.
7503	7503	18	18	target: Hadwin, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With a relatively weak field, this could be Cantlay's platform to shine. The gamble in this group is Hadwin, who took the tour by storm in the early parts of 2017 with a win, four top-10s and a 59, yet has been a non-entity as of late (missing three of his past five cuts). However, he does have two top-10s at this event, including a T-7 at Glen Abbey in 2015.
1246	1246	10	10	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was eighth on tour in scrambling last season. Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013.
10239	10239	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes naturally it's a huge ask and Rahm will have plenty on his plate this week, but back-to-back victories are nothing new these days and particularly for a man of his talent. Rahm spent 60 weeks as World Amateur Number 1 and just a look at his amateur history shows back-to-back wins plus victories in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah. Asked last week about his love for California, Rahm answered, "The main reason why I don't live in San Diego or in California is taxes, to be honest.
6299	6299	33	33	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler has had a lot of time to think about missing a prime chance at the U.S. Open, and we should see where his head is at first thing on Thursday. That said, Fowler checks off all the boxes: 11th in SG: Tee-to-Green, seventh in SG: Putting and first in scrambling. He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance.
7462	7462	13	13	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good min-price punt this week. Others: Robert Garrigus  High-upside GPP Picks  Bubba Watson ($9,400): Watson has picked up the pace a bit over his couple of starts and comes in off the back of three straight made cuts and a T27 at last weeks Open. It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well.
1520	1520	10	10	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel: Bill Haas ($10,500)  Fantasy folks should keep a close eye on Jamie Lovemark and Charles Howell III after their top-10s last week, but the pick here is Haas, who's coming off a T-13 of his own. The winner in the desert in both 2010 and 2015, he obviously not only knows his way around these courses, but even as a quick player owns the patience necessary to play his best golf in the midst of a pro-am format.
4601	4601	6	6	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			15 player in the world. Jordan Spieth, Sung Kang, Boo Weekley & Charley Hoffman – Spieth. Meh.
10743	10743	20	20	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure. (Note: It is worth following how Day says his back is feeling prior to Thursday.)
11766	11766	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style. Matt Kuchar – Cash – DK: $8200 FD: $10600  Although last weekend was rough for Matt Kuchar, I have full confidence to go back to him in cash game contests this week.
2007	2007	22	22	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His name isn’t Pee Wee either. Here is this weeks DK squad:  $10,000 Sneds  $7,900 Castro  $6,900 TRUMPS BOY  $7,000 Jones  $8,800 Walker  $9,300 Mickelson  Wagering:  1st Round Leader  Sneds 25/1  Hadwin 60/1  Kirk 65/1  Hossler 120/1  Sabbatini 120/1  Mahan 140/1  Small wagers here for a fun first day. Went with mainly MP and PB guys to start.
13635	13635	39	40	target: Paul Casey's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
3325	3325	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a different golfer this year and just looks so confident out there. If you have followed us the past month you can probably tell that we have loved Rickie Fowler this year. And it has paid significant dividends.
2146	2146	29	29	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He started 2017 fairly slowly but I really like the fact he was in contention at the Farmers a few weeks ago, a course he’d never challenged at previously. Casey brings great course history to this event and also a tee to green game which is amoung the best in the world right now. He’s my favorite from the 8k range which is littered with great players.
1350	1350	2	3	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Patrick Reed is a great bet at 60/1. Course History and extreme recent form being overvalued by the books.… https://t.co/TbrLwKNofc
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
10420	10420	14	15	target: Emiliano Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			McGirt is lso T31 in total driving, 16th in GIR and eighth in scrambling. Emiliano Grillo … This member of the famed “Class of 2011” hasn't so much been forgotten as overshadowed by his brethren, even though he hasn't missed any of the big events since capturing the Rookie of the Year award in 2015-16. However, and suddenly it seems, he's in the last year of the exemption for winning the Safeway Open to launch that season, as well as measurably outside the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking (currently 73rd) and eligible for only one major (Open Championship) and one WGC (Bridgestone) at the moment.
13148	13148	26	26	target: Ryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically he's perfect for me this week and after shooting -5/67 on Sunday at Augusta to finish a career-best 20th, he's arriving with momentum. Result: T5  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £/€20 risk-free bet** for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 EW, 1/5 odds):  I will close with Ryan Moore who I think will be the kind of plotter who could thrive at Harbour Town. A player who's traditionally gone from Augusta direct to Quail Hollow in terms of schedule, Ryan now finds himself outside of the OWGR top 50 and needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Open.
3328	3328	9	10	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice. Casey has played Augusta well the last 2 years finishing 4th and 6th.
2679	2679	1	1	target: DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet ($8,400) – Don’t look now, but DeLaet is starting to regain his PGA Tour relevance at a very rapid pace. With top 20 finishes at Phoenix, Riviera, and PGA National, DeLaet is clearly returning to form as one of the best ball strikers in the game, even if his scrambling and putting still aren’t quite up to snuff. He’s a great value this week.
6827	6827	9	10	target: Rory Sabbatini 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's because he's currently 132nd in the FedExCup standings. Rory Sabbatini … He's only 41 years old, but he's been around long enough to have competed in the final edition of the John Deere Classic at Oakwood Country Club as a PGA TOUR rookie in 1999. The South African may have wondered why he didn't back to the Quad Cities sooner than 2012.
2201	2201	20	20	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s close, and Riviera has been kind to him – top-4 finishes five times since T-10 in 2009. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
4103	4103	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A win in Fiji on the PGA Tour of Australasia two years ago slightly saves face, but there are obvious concerns at $11,500 and I am tempted to fade him this week. Brooks Koepka ($10,900) – Brooks Koepka at $10,900, are you crazy? Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best.
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
10492	10492	21	22	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, with lower ownership, you are not going to need much exposure to be overweight on the field. $6K-$7K Range  Both Zach Johnson and Kevin Chappell will be 15%+ in GPP's this week at $7,700 on DraftKings. I am leaning Zach Johnson as he comes back to TPC Scottsdale with excellent course history with Top 15 finishes in three straight years and has been very consistent so far this year.
12824	12824	5	5	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All of this is valid. Thomas does have to prove he can contend at Augusta, whereas every other player right at the front of this market has done so once or more already. It's this which is keeping him from the front of the win-only market, because on a golf course which we could reasonably describe as a level playing field, he would certainly not be as big as 15.0; in fact he'd probably be favourite.
5838	5838	27	28	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kevin Kisner – Sizzling after his win at Colonial and T-6 at Memorial, Kisner’s proven that he doesn’t mind a bit of Bentgrass on the greens. He’s Rickie Fowler “light”, and that’s meant as a compliment as he checks in fifth in SG: Total and registers in the top 40 of the major statistical categories. He’s absolutely solid through the entire bag.
727	727	14	14	target: Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
4171	4171	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While both make their debuts at TPC Louisiana, it’s a Pete Dye design and Grace has already thrived on such courses despite limited opportunities, most notably when winning at Harbour Town a year ago. Oosthuizen’s long, straight driving has to be considered a huge asset given the roll of honour at this lengthy par 72, and like Grace he’s been on the fringes of contention for much of 2017 without quite putting the pieces together, although he was mighty close in Phoenix back in February. The chief reason for liking them here is that we know they are a formidable force both when sharing a ball and when playing their own.
4008	4008	4	4	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock and load. Adam Hadwin ($9,100) – Seriously, how long can we ride the Hadwin train. I am not hopping off as he is playing the golf of his life.
10623	10623	2	3	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price. The American already has on his CV a win in a top-class field on the California coast.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
2029	2029	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
1161	1161	15	15	target: Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golf Card: Rose (-105) over Rory E/W Career Builder Sneds 35/1 Knox 40/1 Chappell 40/1 Piercy 80/1 Only Tuesday… https://t.co/rdOWWq7C59
8042	8042	22	22	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He does not play at Quail Hollow every year, but in the starts he has made he has yielded some good results. Johnson finished 14th here in 2014 after the changes were made to the greens and before that had finished 6th in 2011 and 11th in 2009. The changes made this week don’t play into Johnson’s hands, with the course being lengthened but as we know Johnsons is capable of winning and contending at courses that appear too long for him.
3721	3721	8	9	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun. As Kisner took Jim Furyk all the way having never before had a serious chance to win at this level, what his coach said suddenly made sense.
9722	9722	21	21	target: Leishman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week. Marc Leishman, $17,600    Coming off a strong last season, Leishman hasn’t skipped a beat as he was runner-up at the CJ Cup and a disappointing tie for seventh last week after leading through 36 holes. The Aussie has plenty of great history at Waialae to back up his form too: 8-of-8 made cuts with two top 10s.
7398	7398	2	2	target: Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
2717	2717	19	19	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He adds: "I love this golf course and had a pretty good record here, a lot of solid rounds." Dufner has done well in a couple of birdie fests but overall he much prefers something harder. Speaking in January, he said: "I play pretty well on tougher golf courses, usually that kind of 6- to 10-under range is a good number for me (he won the USPGA with 10-under)."
6556	6556	27	27	target: Finau’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory. The weakest part of Finau’s game is accuracy off of the tee; according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, we can see it is the only category he significantly loses stroked to the field in. However with very wide fairways that weakness is mitigated greatly.
8017	8017	36	36	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
9276	9276	14	14	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Hero World Challenge 2017  Lock of the week:  Embed from Getty Images  Justin Rose – $8,600 – It would be wise of you to lock in the only guy in the field with his primary residence being in the Bahamas. Insert Justin Rose. Rose has two wins, a T4, and a T10 in his last four starts since late October.
1673	1673	13	13	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When you look at his stats and course history, you can see why. Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016.
11422	11422	17	18	target: Dean Burmester 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rapidly 75th in the Official World Golf Ranking, he's making his first appearance on the PGA TOUR. Dean Burmester … There has to be some bittersweetness to his appearance this week. See, if he didn't qualify, his other option would be to defend his title at the Tshwane Open in his native South Africa.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
9014	9014	13	14	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Xander Schauffele – $9,700  The are pretty slim pickings at the top of the board this week. Thomas, Matsuyama and Casey are all good options and clearly the elite of the field, but my favorite golfer in terms of price, ownership and upside has to be Xander Schauffele.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
4230	4230	1	2	target: B. Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. B. Haas – Should be playing better than he is. Look for a top 5 here.
2032	2032	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
5394	5394	33	33	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had a good week at the Masters in Augusta finishing T9 and followed that with a T6 at The Players Championship shooting rounds of 70,72,71,70 to post five under par in total. Scott has had some good performances on tricky courses this year including a T11 in Riviera at the Genesis Open and T14 at The Honda at the end of February. Scott has only played here once before finishing seventh in 2007 and also ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 17th in driving distance, 12th in birdie average and 293rd in par 4 birdie or better leaders.
5154	5154	43	44	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the highest purse behind only the four majors, THE PLAYERS, and the four WGC events, there’s plenty to get excited about in Columbus this week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – William McGirt  2015 – David Lingmerth  2014 – Hideki Matsuyama  2013 – Matt Kuchar  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Justin Rose  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – K.J. Choi    Key Stats to Winning at Muirfield Village    • Driving Distance  • Par-5 Scoring  • Scrambling percentage    Champion’s Profile    As only Jack would have it, Muirfield’s par-5s are scoring holes and the greens are lightning-quick.
13568	13568	19	20	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As of midday Wednesday, he's way out front in ownership percentage at 20 percent. That's eight clicks better than Luke List in second and 14 points clear of both Sergio Garcia and Brendan Steele. Surely, there are options.
568	568	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
7685	7685	23	24	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is the defending champion. Pinterest Chris Condon  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Dustin Johnson  Jason Day  Rory McIlroy  Hideki Matsuyama  Brooks Koepka  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Bubba Watson  Professor's Explanation: Firestone is a big track. It is a "bombers and gorgers" kind of place.
11228	11228	16	17	target: Brian Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In two previous starts at PGA National he has finished 17th or better. -- Zach Turcotte  Brian Gay  Between his poor course history and not being a household name, Gay is going to be off most people's radar this week. Couple those things with a missed cut at last week's Genesis Open, and you might think I'm crazy.
3791	3791	20	20	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has played very well around here before finishing T2 last year, T18 in 2015 and T9 in 2014. Staswise Knox ranks 10th in driving accuracy which is a plus around here. If he starts well the Scot could regain some of that early season form on a course that clearly suits his eye.
11196	11196	14	14	target: Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That may hurt him in a lot of places, but not at PGA National. Fowler's win last year was his third top-10 in this event, and he has two other top-25s. Justin Thomas - $11,300 (10-1)  Thomas has played six tournaments in 2017-28 and all six have resulted in top-25s.
2193	2193	11	12	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he loves Riviera, with six top 10s in nine starts. Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
5980	5980	6	7	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
3498	3498	5	5	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Knox’ experience is invaluable and Thomas has again enlisted his help, ahead of his second Masters start. Jimmy Johnson, Thomas’ caddie also believes the now 4-time PGA Tour winner is in much better shape this time around. Johnson, speaking of Thomas said “He won those (three) tournaments by having patience.
3343	3343	27	27	target: McIlroy’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to our Trends tool, golfers with a LT Adjusted Bird Avg of at least 16.5 have manufactured an +8.74 Plus/Minus at Augusta National. Birdies are good: McIlroy’s ability to string together birdies will help him achieve the Streak Bonus in FanDuel’s scoring system and has helped him average a second-best 88.7 PPT on DraftKings the past 12 months. McIlroy’s 308.3-yard LT Driving Distance ranks third, and he’s one of just eight golfers in the field with an average of at least 305 yards.
3484	3484	87	87	target: Phil, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That missed cut last year was just his third in 24 appearances at Augusta and as such I believe it was almost an anomaly. Before his lacklustre effort in a weather-affected, Shell Houston Open last week, Mickelson was in fine form, making it to the quarter-finals of the Match Play (his tied best performance in the event) after finishing T7 at the WGC – Mexico Championship. I am more than happy to overlook the finish last week, purely because I see last week as a tune-up for Phil, rather than him going for the win.
3300	3300	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes(-16) 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's take a look at the last five year's winners and the scorecard before jumping into the fantasy approach. 2016 - Jim Herman(-15)  - Jim Herman(-15) 2015 - J.B. Holmes(-16)  - J.B. Holmes(-16) 2014 - Matt Jones(-15)  - Matt Jones(-15) 2013 - D.A. Points(-16)  - D.A.
10990	10990	7	8	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6 cuts made in a row here. Kevin Chappell $7,700 – He has really weird course history. MC 26th MC 23rd MC 24th MC.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
1129	1129	17	17	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The youngster admitted they didn't have their best stuff but it was still a strong performance. For Fowler, it follows on from T6 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China a month ago. Adding to his credentials is his third place here at Albany 12 months ago where he shot 65-64 on the weekend.
3246	3246	18	18	target: Tringale 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- At 50-to-1, this horse-for-course pick also had a very strong showing at the WGC-Match Play. Longshot: Cameron Tringale -- We don't typically dig this deep, but at 150-to-1, Tringale is worth a few quid, particularly on an each-way bet, given his track record in this tournament. 2017 Shell Houston Open betting odds
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
5621	5621	40	40	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will come into play a lot more than on a regular course, because putting will be neutralized a bit with just getting to greens being a struggle. Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy.
6636	6636	21	22	target: Curtis Luck 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the defending champion of the Greenbrier Classic - why should you keep an eye on him this weekend? And finally, Curtis Luck might be just a rookie - but why might he surprise the field in Virginia? Tune in to find you that and more!
3338	3338	32	32	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His averages are hurt by last year’s 75.5-point DraftKings performance in which he yielded an ugly -4.92 Plus/Minus. Spieth: Masters Report  Per our Trends tool, in the two years prior to 2016 McIlroy averaged 89.25 PPT and a +4.87 Plus/Minus with 100 percent Consistency. He was a beast in 2015, racking up 105.5 points and a +7.64 Plus/Minus.
9148	9148	15	16	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’re comfortable enough with Nick in GPPs or cash game contests. Best bargain basement option:  Aaron Wise $6,900 – We love Wise this week in GPP contests as we anticipate his ownership around 5%. Wise trains at TPC Summerlin and calls it a home track.
13143	13143	18	19	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Michael Thompson; 2) Adam Hadwin; 3) Charles Howell III; 4) Paul Casey / Brian Harman / Luke List; 7) Patrick Cantlay; 8) Dustin Johnson; 9) Charley Hoffman; 10) Chris Kirk / Scott Piercy / Xander Schauffele; 13) Ross Fisher / Emiliano Grillo; 15) Jason Kokrak; 16) Francesco Molinari / Harold Varner III; 18) Corey Conners / Lucas Glover / James Hahn.

6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
12783	12783	52	53	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money. A winner of the Farmers Insurance Open in January, a course that has seen Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson triumph in the past, Day captured his 11th PGA Tour title and first for 20 months. From there 2nd at Pebble Beach and a competitive 22nd at Bay Hill after a month's inactivity highlight a player who's playing some decent stuff under the radar.
1711	1711	34	34	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whilst Koepka wasn’t a surprise winner, it was still his maiden win and as a result three of the last five winners have also been first-time PGA Tour winners. Kevin Stadler (2014) and Kyle Stanley (2012) also got their maiden PGA Tour wins at this venue in the last five renewals. Stanley especially, showed great character in the year of his win, bouncing back from a disappointing collapse at the Farmers Insurance Open just one week prior to his win here.
13054	13054	46	46	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries. Second and fifth on his last two starts, Woods will now look to add to a body of work at Augusta National which shows four wins and nine other top 10s, seven of those top fives. If you can't quite see Tiger getting it done, a top 5 or top 10 punt could be a very good way of cheering him on.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2059	2059	14	14	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
11498	11498	22	23	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The world’s top-ranked players will congregate in a small 65-player field packed with talent to duke it out over four guaranteed rounds. Dustin Johnson, now established as World No. 1 for over a year, will look to win three of the last four iterations of this event dating back to the 2015 edition played at Doral.
1673	1673	13	13	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When you look at his stats and course history, you can see why. Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016.
41	41	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#TheBarclays Long Shot Bets: Vegas 150/1, Stefani 250/1, Glover 150/1.
1981	1981	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, there's that gamble. Kirk skipped Pebble last year and missed the cut the year before, He was runner-up to Snedeker in 2013. Stewart Cink - $7,500 (Field, 3-1)    Cink is playing this year via his one-time career money list exemption, and he's making the most of it.
8851	8851	33	34	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Matt Kuchar being priced at $7,700 on Draftkings he will make a great cash-game play or just throw him in as a core player in your GPP lineups, you won't regret it. Paul Casey @ $8,600  I don't think that there's a whole lot that I need to say about Paul Casey. He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week.
2357	2357	1	1	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays. Grace is also 37th in greens in regulation percentage. There’s also the fact seven of the last nine winners of the Honda Classic weren’t from the United States.
7630	7630	32	33	target: Patrick Cantlay, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s projected for a chalky 26-30 percent ownership and leads all golfers this week with 11 Pro Trends. The Value Plays  Perhaps the most intriguing golfer in the field this week is Patrick Cantlay, a 25-year-old golfer who was formerly the world’s No. 1 amateur.
12831	12831	26	26	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finally, his preparation has been near perfect. Speaking prior to the Honda Classic that he'd go on to win via the first of two successive play-offs, Thomas said he felt he just needed to get in contention again to establish some momentum. Beating Luke List there before forcing extra holes against Phil Mickelson in Mexico means he's done what he felt he needed to do and more.
5188	5188	69	70	target: Matt Kuchar(-12) 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's quickly take a look at the course details and past five winners and then jump into the stats and fantasy approach. The Course  Muirfield Village Golf Club - Dublin, OH  Par 72 - 7,392 Yards  Greens - Bentgrass Greens  **Click to Enlarge**  Past Five Winners  2016 - William McGirt(-15)  - William McGirt(-15) 2015 - David Lingmerth(-15)  - David Lingmerth(-15) 2014 - Hideki Matsuyama(-13)  - Hideki Matsuyama(-13) 2013 - Matt Kuchar(-12)  - Matt Kuchar(-12) 2012 - Tiger Woods(-9)  The Stats & Fantasy Approach  My Key Stats:  Strokes Gained Tee to Green  Strokes Gained: Approach  Greens in Regulation from 175-200 Yards  Par 4 Scoring/Bogey Avoidance  Par 5 Birdie or Better %  Looking at the cheatsheet and the last three years results and correlated stats, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green shows up as the clear #1 stat to target. With Driving Distance and Accuracy both really low on the correlated list, it has me put a lot of emphasis on the Approach shot this week and specifically from 175-200.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
4364	4364	6	6	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down. Sleepers  We are going to try something new this week with the new format.
412	412	19	19	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Related: 2016 European Ryder Cup team  This week it’s the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston in Massachusetts. Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done.
3649	3649	53	53	target: Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It worries me slightly here with so much around-the-green work to be done, but if he continues to lap the field in SG: Approach and Putting, he’ll make enough birdies to counteract the hiccups. Oh, he’s the highest ranked player in the field too (16th), don’t forget that… I’m such a sucker for Dufner. He’s never been a great Pete Dye player, but his game theoretically translates perfectly.
11195	11195	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance." He's also among the game's elite scramblers.
6569	6569	29	30	target: Danny Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With his price, I’d expect high ownership but Finau is not a player I want to fade this week as I think he sets up great for this event. Danny Lee – Cash – DK: $9500 FD: $8400  Last week I picked Danny Lee and discussed how he is the type of player that consistently plays well when he shows good form; this week I see no reason to jump off the train. Lee combines good form with great course history (defending champion) and although he will see high ownership he is a lock for me in any cash game format.
6810	6810	15	16	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s good value given his rise in form and will be low owned in gpps. Roberto Castro ($6,500): Castro finally showed some signs of life last week with a T20 finish, his best of 2017. Castro has generally struggled in all areas this year but the fact he put together three rounds in the 60’s for he first time since 2016 is noticeable.
11018	11018	30	31	target: Tom Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Tom Hoge $6,600 – Hollywood Hoge is somewhat of a gut call down here in this range. He’s a tremendous ball striker from tee to green but cursed with the ever elusive hot and cold putter.
13668	13668	33	34	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
11428	11428	1	1	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil. He has two top 5s in four events, gaining strokes on approach shots in all four (17.2 over his last four to be exact).
688	688	10	10	target: Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - Texas Open - 2ew C Hoffman 25-1; 1ew Grace 28-1, Chappell 33-1, Horschel 35-1, Moore 28-1
4411	4411	1	1	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler took the title in 2015 and although his course record is feast or famine he can scarcely have arrived in better form. Fowler currently leads the tour in adjusting scoring average and it’s difficult to find any chinks in his armour. He missed the cut in New Orleans but that was a team format, when it comes to stroke play his record in 2017 is MC-4-1-16-12-3-11.
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
1045	1045	7	7	target: Bryson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SentryTOC Card 💰💰💰 Kiz 28-1 Harman 35-1 Bryson 66-1 Dufner 80-1 Si WOOOOOO 100-1 Cook 100-1 *EW on Bryson and below
4099	4099	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
13410	13410	68	68	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's almost two years since the affable veteran started a final round within two strokes of the lead and while there's plenty to indicate that he's just about as good as ever, that's not enough to be confident at prices no bigger than 20/1. Charley Hoffman can play this place blindfolded and will become the default selection for many, but it's another former champion in the reliable Brendan Steele who looks better value at around the 40/1 mark. TPC San Antonio is a fairly long, very demanding course which we know plays to Steele's strengths.
3613	3613	13	14	target: Marc Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There seems to be no course that can over match this young phenom. Marc Leishman – $7,100  Even though Marc Leishman was a late addition to the DraftKings player pool, they still got his price wrong. His odds suggest he should be priced about $500 more, as does his recent form.
3904	3904	9	9	target: Charley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Charley Hoffman ($10,700) – This week’s Luke Donald, Charley has never finished worse than T13 in seven tries at TPC San Antonio, including a win last year. He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him.
10434	10434	25	25	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki should easily be among the highest-owned players on all DFS golf websites, but he’s more than worth the salary and attention this week. Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season.
1306	1306	46	46	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My advice though is don't get caught in the 'must play Kapalua' camp - it helps but certainly isn't totally critical as Henley, Wilson and Palmer have proven in recent years. I must say though that since the introduction of the wrap-around season, Waialae winners namely Walker (x2), Gomez and Thomas have all played the Tournament of Champions. Course experience seems to be pay real dividends at Waialae as 11 of the past 12 champions had played the Sony Open multiple times prior to lifting the trophy.
11373	11373	35	35	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It was interesting listening to Phil Mickelson in interview last year here where he talked at length about the nuances of altitude golf and how it can favour 'feel golfers' such as himself and with Bubba cut from a similar cloth in that respect, I can see him enjoying this week after finishing 38th on debut 12 months ago when at a very low ebb. Classical courses carry no concerns for Watson who's twice mastered Augusta National - and who's to say he won't contend again this year - and those tracks featuring Kikuyu on the fairways and rough and Poa Annua on the greens are clearly no issue, as was once again demonstrated at the Genesis on his last start. Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view.
463	463	2	2	target: Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thoughts on Brehm at $5900 on DK? 9th in DD / 33rd in BirdieAvg on @WebDotComTour last year. Slow greens neutralize poor putting... #DFS
6759	6759	9	10	target: Zach Johnson). 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steve Stricker from the Cheesehead state and Iowa native Zach Johnson). Take a look at the previous winners below:  2009 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2011 – Steve Stricker (Yes Back to Back to Back)  2012 – Zach Johnson  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2015- Jordan Spieth  2016 – Ryan Moore  You can start to notice a trend with the players that have won here, they are great putters on the green. TPC Deere Run is a Par 71 playing at 7,268 yards.
1289	1289	45	45	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never a great Par 5 player, that impact with be mitigated, allowing his dominance on Par 4s (16th scoring average) and Par 3s (25th scoring average) to do the work. Basically, at courses that limit his driver and focus on the rest of his game, Haas regularly contends. Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth, Brandt Snedeker & Jimmy Walker – There’s absolutely no need to be a hero this early in the Fantasy golf season.
9567	9567	15	16	target: Cameron Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also ranked 18th in scrambling and 37th in SG: Putting throughout the 2016-17 season. Cameron Smith - $14,400    Smith should be a popular selection at this price, despite the fact that he’s making his career debut at the Kapalua Resort. The 24-year-old most recently won the Australian PGA Championship as he posted his fourth consecutive top-five result.
4933	4933	52	53	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As always the Dean & DeLuca Invitational is a popular stop on the PGA Tour schedule, the Masters Champion Sergio Garcia and Jordan Spieth headline the 121 man field. Major champions Phil Mickelson, Zach Johnson and Graeme McDowell are also in attendance alongside Jon Rahm and the American trio of Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and Brandt Snedeker. Designed by John Bredemus & Perry Maxwell, Colonial Country Club is a tight Par 70 layout measuring 7,204 yards.
6913	6913	31	31	target: McNealy, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			McNealy won the Haskins Award as the top collegiate golfer in 2015 and has competed on the PGA Tour several times in the last two years. The sky's the limit for McNealy, and in a soft field on an easy course, young Maverick should shine. His price also allows for a great deal of wiggle room in constructing the rest of your roster.
9981	9981	50	51	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All three will be popular this week and I will have a ton of exposure to Cauley and Reavie in cash games but feel there are some projected lower owned players in this range to help us separate ourselves in GPP formats. The first player I will be targeting is Chesson Hadley who I wrote up above. He currently sits T18 in tags and has just 11 start recommendations as of Wednesday afternoon.
7662	7662	6	7	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recommended bets: WGC-Bridgestone Invitational      1pt e.w. Jason Dufner at 66/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) - straight hitter and that's a key trait that's needed at Firestone  1pt e.w. Justin Thomas at 50/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) - good record in Ohio and likely to be inspired by friend Spieth's Open show  1pt e.w.
465	465	41	42	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
4085	4085	46	47	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ownership projections you see here are my initial projections and will be updated as the week goes on so be sure to follow me on twitter to find out where you can get all the most updated ownership information. While it’s still early, this week Patrick Reed looks to be a good candidate if you’re looking for low ownership. While it’s clear he isn’t playing great now, his price has continued to drop and at some point you can expect Patrick Reed to bounce back.
2122	2122	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
3861	3861	10	11	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantastic player to throw in your Cash or GPP lineups. Kyle Stanley $7,200 – Stanley is coming off a T8 at the Shell, T17 at Bay Hill, and T27 at Valspar. He leads the PGA Tour in the Ball-Striking statistic which is the most heavily weighted stat this week at Harbour Town.
8835	8835	33	33	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Granted, there are others in this field who have been playing better but not always does this event go to someone who arrives on a tear. In fact, at 25th in the standings Garcia is in exactly the same position from which Bill Haas scooped the lot with that famous shot out of the lake in 2011. All things considered, Garcia looks a solid alternative to the more fancied runners after controversially sneaking into the field on Sunday night to earn a return to a course which plays to his strengths.
12553	12553	48	48	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 28-year-old has three top 20s in his seven starts in the majors and he'll be particularly ramped this week as he'll be making his US Masters debut next week. Ranked 10th in Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green this season and 14th in Scoring Average, a good putting week and Finau is a big contender here in my book. Next Best: Back Steve Stricker e.w.
1023	1023	36	37	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After picking him to play well in Mexico and watching him miss the cut, I need to see more out of Furyk before I put him in another lineup. • • •  Mike Glasscott  Projected champion: Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ.
3368	3368	27	27	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2015-16, not only did his PPT drop, but he also produced a negative Plus/Minus with the poorest Consistency Rating of his career. So far this season, Spieth has averaged a monster 105.6 PPT with an amazing 80 percent Consistency and +27.0 Plus/Minus — often with the highest salary in the field. Although these numbers are more than likely unsustainable, it’s not out of the question that Spieth could improve upon his averages from his 2014-15 season, since he is still approaching his prime.
10187	10187	14	14	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With single digits under par winning three of the last four Farmers Insurance Opens, Finau will get the sort of test he likes and, indeed, Torrey Pines is right up his street in many ways. The course suits his monster hitting (currently second in Driving Distance), it's a coastal track where it can really blow (Finau won his only Tour title by the sea at the windy Puerto Rico Open and has played well in his two Open Championship starts) and it features Poa Annua greens. Finau is ranked 12th on the Future of Fantasy's list of top performers on Poa since 2013/14.
10186	10186	3	3	target: Finau's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ 33/1  Tony Finau's record in the majors - T10, T14, T18 and T27 in just seven played - shows that he likes and can play well in tough conditions. With single digits under par winning three of the last four Farmers Insurance Opens, Finau will get the sort of test he likes and, indeed, Torrey Pines is right up his street in many ways. The course suits his monster hitting (currently second in Driving Distance), it's a coastal track where it can really blow (Finau won his only Tour title by the sea at the windy Puerto Rico Open and has played well in his two Open Championship starts) and it features Poa Annua greens.
12818	12818	42	42	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This season's tally is two and might well have been four and there are no signs at all that last season's heroics, which ended with a $10m FedEx Cup windfall, might instigate a downturn which some of those before him have faced. Thomas said after the TOUR Championship that the challenge was to reset his goals and go again and it's one he's clearly overcome with little fuss. ⛳️ #TheMasters Tips!
1656	1656	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He did miss the cut in 2014, as he battled his way through injuries, and finished T19 in 2015. The MC was a hiccup, with issues physically, much like Day when he’s gone in at full health, he’s dominated the event. He comes in at 33rd this week, as his Par 5 performance last season wasn’t as good as we’ve seen.
7933	7933	28	28	target: Rory: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With both coming in at excellent price tags and that low ownership, they offer high upside and allow for an extra stud up top. What to do with Rory: For the course history truthers, there’s no greater play this week than insane-chalk-to-be, Rory McIlroy. He’s won twice at Quail Hollow (both pre- and post-green renovations) and has three top-10 finishes that don’t even include his 2nd-place in a playoff, so this is obviously the track the Irishman loves the most on Tour.
1887	1887	11	12	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All the courses in the rotation have impressed me this year." Justin Rose [on Monterrey Peninsula] : "The greens aren't as good here. They're bouncing a little bit, but they're also really quick.
13267	13267	24	25	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Editor’s Note: Adam Hadwin has withdrawn from this week’s RBC Heritage Open. Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Marc Leishman, Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Kuchar, Brian Harman, Kevin Kisner, Charley Hoffman, Xander Schauffele, Francesco Molinari, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ian Poulter, Cameron Smith, Webb Simpson, Adam Hadwin, Si-WOOOO Kim, Satoshi Kodaira, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Martin Kaymer, Vijay Singh and Bryson Dechambeau are all in the 2018 Heritage field, and each one played the weekend in Augusta. Patrick Cantlay, Jason Dufner, Kevin Chappell, Ross Fisher, Dylan Frittelli, Charl Schwartzel, Ted Potter Jr., Billy Horschel, Doc Redman, Austin Cook and defending champion Wes Bryan all had aspirations of donning the Green Jacket, but that dream ended on Friday for them.
8484	8484	12	12	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That much is demonstrated by his record in the FedEx Cup Playoffs. Oosthuizen has eight top-20 finishes from nine starts in the three events prior to East Lake, including fifth in this and second in the Deutsche Bank, and on the back of that effort at Quail Hollow it seems reasonable to expect another strong run. Also noteworthy is the fact that he has won immediately after one of these major near-misses, albeit again in modest company out in Malaysia, while he's been second at Augusta and fourth at Firestone to tick those correlating course boxes.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
1636	1636	39	39	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In addition to his win here, he played very well for most of the 2016 US Open finishing T2 behind Dustin Johnson. A player capable of playing in bad conditions is always good to have on side and with Snedeker and Lowry we have two. What also appeals about Lowry is his course history.
1665	1665	23	25	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hard to ignore the combo. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Brandt Snedeker - $9,500 Jimmy Walker - $9,400 Jon Rahm - $9,200 Charles Howell III - $7,300 Aaron Baddeley - $6,900 Scott Stallings - $6,800  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
1648	1648	10	10	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#HondaClassic Futures Berger +4500 Knox +4500 Scott +5000 Henley +5000 Kizzire +6600 Bradley +9000 Consensus outr… https://t.co/jRr5dO2ulO
11872	11872	96	97	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Jason Day; 2) Hideki Matsuyama; 3) James Hahn; 4) Tommy Fleetwood; 5) Tiger Woods; 6) Cameron Smith; 7) Emiliano Grillo / Patton Kizzire / Alex Noren; 10) Chesson Hadley; 11) Marc Leishman; 12) Charl Schwartzel; 13) Brian Harman / Si Woo Kim; 15) Austin Cook / Justin Rose / Sam Saunders; 18) Tyrrell Hatton; 19) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Zach Johnson / Ollie Schniederjans / Chris Stroud. Winners & Prices : 2017: Leishman 100/1 ; 2016: Day 14/1 ; 2015: Every 300/1 ; 2014: Every 66/1 ; 2013: Woods 3/1 ; 2012: Woods 8/1 ; 2011: Laird 45/1 ; 2010: Els 16/ 1; Average: 69/1.
1609	1609	18	18	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird looks to have a lot going for him here. It may seem a dubious play to Hudson Swafford just days on from his first Tour win. After all, he may just be happy to drink in that success and coast along here and enjoy the spectacular clifftop views.
2026	2026	48	48	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But seriously, he hasn’t missed three cuts in a row since 2013, his play earlier in this season has still been solid, and his history in this tournament is just as sensational as the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open. So while others hopefully zag away from Walker, I will keep zigging and just address the elephant in the room later if he burns me again. Middle of the Road  Phil Mickelson $9,300 – Here’s a fun thing: apparently mild hernias are not that hard to recover from.
3385	3385	26	26	target: Spieth’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2007 Masters Champion Zach Johnson, once said “You just have to be on your toes on every single putt you ever have in the Masters.” Spieth’s elite putting ability gives him an edge at Augusta. Spieth’s 17.1 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is also elite and gives him extra value, given the DraftKings scoring system. Rory McIlroy and the scorching-hot Dustin Johnson are the only golfers in the Masters field with higher LT Adjusted Birdie Averages.
7836	7836	37	38	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matsuyama is second in par 4 scoring and tenth in SG: Off the Tee for the season, and is coming off three straight top 15 finishes (including a T2 at the US Open). He’s been outperformed by Brooks Koepka in the past month, but only barely, and for a cheaper price could easily flip the script here. Jon Rahm ($9,700): Rahm seems to have been mildly dismissed by the salary makers at DraftKings this week as his sub-10k price doesn’t seem to factor in his dominate win in Ireland just three weeks ago.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
3997	3997	14	15	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Curtis Luck ($6,300): *write-up coming*  Others: Danny Lee, Harold Varner III  High-upside GPP Picks  Billy Horschel ($8,900): Not a play I’m admittedly super confident in but a player whose upside at this course I still respect (much like Luke Donald last week). Horschel is coming off a terrible Friday round at Hilton Head but after a week to recharge (his family just welcomed another child to the world as well) I think he can rebound nicely here. Horschel has always liked tougher tracks and is -13 with no rounds worse than par at TPC San Antonio over his last eight rounds played there.
2992	2992	12	13	target: Jonas Blixt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With rain a distinct possibility, Harold also thrives on receptive golf courses. Jonas Blixt 0.5pt EW 100/1 with NEW OFFER! Bet £10 Get £60 free here:  I'll finish with Jonas Blixt who's at an attractive price this week.
2611	2611	47	48	target: Jason Dufner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
6307	6307	6	6	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After starting the season off poorly, Haas has turned it around with decent showings his past few times out. Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well.
8939	8939	38	39	target: Gary Woodland. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's joined by the Tour Championship winner Xander Schauffele and runner-up here 12 months ago Hideki Matsuyama. This week's field also includes Tour Championship qualifiers Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Adam Hadwin, Pat Perez, Kyle Stanley, Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland. Throw-in talented players of the ilk of course winner Anirban Lahiri, Branden Grace, Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel and Thomas Pieters.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
7840	7840	15	16	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a good performance here in 2015 there’s no reason why he can’t contend again. Paul Casey 30/1  The Englishman is having a fantastic season and comes here in great form. Since finishing solo sixth in Augusta at The Masters, Casey’s form figures read 12,22,10, 26, 5, 11.
10012	10012	16	17	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
4307	4307	30	31	target: Webb Simpson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may be wise not to overthink it so I'm looking for a player with a strong record in NC which includes big finishes at the Wells Fargo. Step forward Webb Simpson. Back in 2011, I had a 20/1 'win only' punt on Simpson landing the Wyndham Championship and he obliged, shooting 66-65-64-67 to secure his maiden PGA Tour title.
4057	4057	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
9131	9131	15	16	target: Webb Simpson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2014 - Ben Martin: Round 1: 19th, Round 2: 5th, Round 3: 1st. 2013 - Webb Simpson: Round 1: 6th, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 1st. 2012 - Ryan Moore: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 3rd, Round 3: 1st.

12398	12398	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're chasing and have no qualms about sending anyone out, zone in on the last four champions – Day (2014, 2016), McIlroy (2015) and Dustin Johnson (2017). Day and DJ could square off in the quarterfinals, but you already knew that. Bring it on.
6532	6532	8	8	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like that combination. -- Jason Sobel  Jimmy Walker  Just when you thought he was done, Walker gets to return to a course where it has always been feast or famine: two missed cuts (including 2014, the last time he played the tournament), as well as two fourth-place ties and a runner-up to boot. "Sky" Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7.
4375	4375	28	28	target: McGirt’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Eagle Point is a 2nd shot golf course as you have to be on the right tier of these greens to have a chance at birdie. This suits McGirt’s game pretty well. We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests.
2818	2818	26	27	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
4014	4014	20	21	target: Charley Hoffman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plug him in and don’t check your lineups until Friday night to avoid any mid-round tilt. Also Consider: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Ollie Schneiderjans  Dark Horse  Luke List ($7,600) – Oh man, you aren’t writing up List again are you? He burned some beautiful lineups last weekend.
11932	11932	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
10588	10588	86	87	target: Brendan Steele, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley. Plus, Ian Poulter, Steve Stricker, and Ryan Moore will be making their 2018 PGA debuts.
5002	5002	13	14	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – DEAN & DELUCA Invitational  Lock of the week:  Sergio Garcia $10,800 – We absolutely love Sergio this week on a course that should set up well for a tremendous ball striker like he is. Strokes Gained off the Tee and Strokes Gained Approach are two of our favorite stat categories this week and Garcia is amongst the top 20 in the field in both. The Spaniard faltered a little on Sunday last week but had a tremendous back nine 29 on Saturday and is still on a heater coming off that Masters win in April.
8176	8176	21	21	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler bested McIlroy for the 2012 title in a playoff. He doesn't have quite the track record there as McIlroy, but Fowler has two other top-6s, including T4 last year. He's 13th on Tour in ball striking, 11th in strokes gained tee to green, 9th in scrambling, 1st in strokes gained putting, eighth in par-4 450-500.
11767	11767	31	31	target: Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although he did not look great last week at WGC Mexico I am not overly concerned as this course fits his style much more than what we saw last weekend. Charl Schwartzel – All Formats – DK: $7500 FD: $9800  Although Schwartzel has not seen his name atop a leaderboard in a while he has quietly been making plenty of cuts and has a great history here at Valspar. In the last two years Scwhartzel has finished T6 and won the event in 2016.
10752	10752	40	40	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey is still playing good golf as he showed with his T9 finish a few weeks ago at Abu Dhabi and although he has no course history he has shown over the years his ability to adapt to new courses. Casey also has an incredible streak of 24 made cuts making him safe despite the lack of course history. Patrick Reed – DraftKings Value – DK: $7900 FD: $10700  Whatever was wrong with Reed’s game a few weeks ago seems to be a thing of the past with back-to-back finishes inside of the top 25.
8943	8943	28	28	target: Gary 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You get four opportunities with four par‑5s. So if I drive the ball in play, I have a pretty good chance to be successful out there," was how Gary described TPC Kuala Lumpur test back in 2014 and there's no doubt that Woodland can go low and loves soft, receptive conditions. Take last season as an example: 2nd at a soft El Camaleon came at -19/265; 6th at Waialae came at -17/263; 5th at a soft Pebble beach came at -12/275; 4th at a soft Glen Abbey came at -19/269.
3392	3392	35	36	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even if you do hole them you have to hole them comfortably because if you’re grinding over every three-footer it becomes a burden. Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well.
8229	8229	56	56	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s the final major of the PGA Tour season and very likely the final golf Millionaire Maker on DraftKings until the Masters next April, so finding a low-owned player that produces a ton of fantasy points will be one of the keys to making a run in a huge guaranteed prize pool (GPP) like that. Amazing Grace  A few weeks ago, Branden Grace went goofy with a third-round 63 at the Open Championship — a round that propelled him to a sixth-place finish in that event. Per our Trends tool, in his last 11 majors, Grace has produced a very valuable +7.99 Plus/Minus with 63.6 percent Consistency.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
5220	5220	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years. Haas only has seven tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to an equally priced Byeong Hun An, who has 20.
12150	12150	25	26	target: Lucas Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should go well and I’ll be backing him for a top 10. Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season.
9903	9903	128	129	target: J.J. Spaun; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour / Brian Stuard; 3) Brian Harman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Colt Knost; 6) Austin Cook / David Hearn; 8) Kevin Kisner; 9) Lucas Glover / Brendan Steele; 11) Tyler Duncan; 12) Hunter Mahan / Steve Wheatcroft; 14) John Huh / Sean O'Hair; 16) Brice Garnett / Brian Gay; 18) Joel Dahmen; 19) Vaughn Taylor; 20) Alex Cejka / Kevin Streelman. Greens in Regulation : 1) Brian Harman / Kevin Streelman; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Brendan Steele; 5) Brian Stuard; 6) Ryan Armour; 7) Lucas Glover / Kevin Kisner; 9) Sang-moon Bae / Chesson Hadley / J.J. Spaun; 12) Patton Kizzire; 13) Austin Cook; 14) Peter Uihlein; 15) Scott Piercy; 16) Alex Cejka; 17) Kevin Chappell / Beau Hossler / Trey Mullinax / C.T. Pan.
9538	9538	45	46	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
2575	2575	22	22	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
1063	1063	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar. It's easy to wait on Kuchar since he's so consistent week-to-week.
1023	1023	7	7	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is GOLDEN CHERUB chalk week. Cam Smith has been HOT, can he keep it going as a first timer? We shall see.....… https://t.co/0qiHzBRD0y
4268	4268	1	1	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harold Varner III ($6300): To afford a player like Jon Rahm, it’s necessary to squeeze in one of the cheaper players with upside, and Varner fits that to a tee. Although he’s not currently the longest hitter on Tour, Varner sits T45 in Carry Distance and in the past has been known for his distance. The “Dab King” averages 3.74 birdies and converts birdie or better on 16.03% of approach shots between 150-175 yards.
11932	11932	1	1	target: Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
4718	4718	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option  Anirban Lahiri $6,400 – We wanted to go super basement option here and give you a guy you can pair with DJ comfortably. There’s a lot of good value in the upper $6K range this week, but Lahiri is our guy in the bottom of this range. Now, if you were paying attention on Friday at TPC, Lahiri was -6 on his round approaching the 18th tee, where he then proceeded to hit 3 tee shots in the water left to miss the cut by 4 shots.
11227	11227	24	25	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players whom they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Sergio Garcia  Making his 2018 U.S. debut, the reigning Masters champion has the ball-striking prowess to succeed at PGA National. He finished second to Adam Scott in 2016 and already has a victory to his name earlier this year at the Singapore Open.
4522	4522	18	19	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are also some cheaper golfers that are attractive when you combine Driving Distance and Greens in Regulation. Paul Casey ($8,300) is currently 49th in Driving Distance and 11th in Greens in Regulation. He has made nine straight cuts this year.
7609	7609	34	34	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously.
7570	7570	18	18	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
13216	13216	37	37	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Full team course history with this play because he has not been playing well at all. Betting Card  Outrights:  Hadwin 33/1 WD  Grillo 40/1  Kisner 45/1  List 55/1  Molinari 60/1 + E/W  Si Woo 100/1 + T10  Cook 100/1 + T10  T10 – Donald 10/1  It’s grown more than I intended but they are pretty light bets on the bottom 5 guys, with the emphasis at the top. Be sure to follow me on twitter (@FantasyJesusDFS) if you don’t already.
7840	7840	16	16	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a good performance here in 2015 there’s no reason why he can’t contend again. Paul Casey 30/1  The Englishman is having a fantastic season and comes here in great form. Since finishing solo sixth in Augusta at The Masters, Casey’s form figures read 12,22,10, 26, 5, 11.

12002	12002	7	7	target: Jamie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After time off for the necessary rehab Jamie a historical fader of the ball had developed a hook in his game, which coupled with the pressure he was under to fulfil a Major Medical Exemption lead to real struggles on the course. Eventually under the guidance of Chris Como and with a lot of hard work, Lovemark re built his game and career through the Web.com tour and this is now his third consecutive full season back on the PGA Tour. Each of the last two seasons has seen a string of steady performances and high finishes and the only thing that has been missing from the CV is the win.
5298	5298	19	19	target: Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With it being a par-70, the par-5 scoring won’t be an impactful loss. Because of the accuracy and steadiness, Reavie is 27th in Bogey Avoidance, but he’s also been steady on the greens at 16th in 3-Putt Avoidance. He doesn’t score enough to make him an elite DraftKings play, but he can finish high enough here to pay off his cheap salary.
2207	2207	18	18	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Jordan Spieth. Why back off now?
11467	11467	36	36	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why it is so hard to bypass Justin Thomas, who actually was leading the tournament after three rounds a year ago, a shot ahead of Johnson, but faded to a 1-over 72. Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous.
54	54	22	23	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Webb Simpson - $10,200  2. William McGirt - $8,700  3.
3192	3192	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			7th here in 2014, wind and a soft course are the kind of conditions where Ryan truly comes to the fore. RESULT: MC  Bud Cauley 0.5pt EW 200/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  Bud Cauley has always been an aggressive sort whose tee-to-green game can be very effective. He performs better at low-scoring tests and his record here reads 8th in 2012 (on debut) and 16th in 2013.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
11736	11736	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In three starts at this course, Finau missed his first two cuts, before finishing 5th here last season, largely thanks to a final round 64. Finau will be looking to join Woodland as a bomber to break the mould here at Copperhead and buck the trend of shorter winners getting their name on the trophy here. His missed cut at the Phoenix Open was his first of the season and his only one so far, and he bounced back with a T2 finish at the Genesis Open on his next start.
9692	9692	15	16	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watch those Fanshare tags, if he is low then I’ll be all over him. “Value”  Gary Woodland $7,800 – His last 3 starts here: 6th, 13th, 3rd. I will have plenty and he will more than likely be on my cash team.
3641	3641	5	6	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RBC Heritage Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Bill Haas & Graeme McDowell – If it’s a Dye design, it’s time to roll out Haas in your lineups. He’s gained strokes on the field around the greens in seven straight events, made 12 consecutive cuts, and keeps posting quality results on the Dye layouts (3rd/T17/T43/T14/T9/T9)… Before no-showing the Puerto Rico Open, GMAC was starting to recapture his game again.
7386	7386	70	70	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			English has suffered a difficult 2017, but he’s been able to perform at some of those courses I’ve mentioned and to be honest it’s amazing he’s made any cuts at all given how abysmal he’s been off the tee, which played a part in his making an 11 at the Travelers last month. However, there was a noted step up on his latest start when T29 at the Greenbrier, where English made gains off the tee in every round, eventually ranking 19th in the field. Considering he’s only just inside the top 200 this season, that’s a jolt of improvement worth noting.
8440	8440	47	48	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some stats below from the opening round of the Playoffs over the past few years:  P ath to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Patrick Reed: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 2nd. 2015 - Jason Day: Round 1: 18th, Round 2: 8th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Hunter Mahan: Round 1: 2nd, Round 2: 12th, Round 3: 3rd.
13060	13060	36	37	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we are focusing on the 8K and up range this week, all of these guys have a legitimate chance of winning this tournament, but like I said earlier, you have to make a stand somewhere. Phil Mickelson: DK $9500/FD $11200  All you really need to do is look at the picture at the top of this page. Phil is wearing a collared, button up shirt, with his jumpman logo on the cuffs, in a practice round.
8060	8060	49	49	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has not finished outside the top-40 since his last missed cut at the Players Championship and his last three starts read T7 (Greenbrier Classic), T27 (Open Championship and T5 (RBC Canadian Open) so he is coming into this week with plenty of form. In terms of course form, Finau has done ok in limited starts at Quail Hollow, finishing 16th and 28th on his two starts there in 2015 and 2016. Statistically this has been a very impressive year for Finau so far, ranking 4th in Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee, 6th Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green and 30th in Strokes Gained: Approach-The-green.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
11510	11510	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups. Value Plays:  Paul Casey $8,400 – The case for Paul Casey is fairly simple as he is easily the most glaring error in pricing that jumps out at us. He is a box-checking machine this week as far as Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, and Strokes Gained: Off the Tee.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
11019	11019	25	25	target: Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tremendous ball striker from tee to green but cursed with the ever elusive hot and cold putter. Since the season started in October, Hoge has been in position to win his first PGA Tour event three times but failed to close the door. Unfortunately, two of his three missed cuts all season have come in the last two weeks.
11206	11206	42	42	target: Anirban 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
8748	8748	83	84	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.
12150	12150	26	26	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should go well and I’ll be backing him for a top 10. Finally, I’ll be having bets in two match bets this week, taking Lucas Glover to beat Ryan Moore, and Jason Kokrak to beat Louis Oosthuzien. Starting with Glover and Moore, if you were to run this as a mythical matchup over the years at Bay Hill, Glover would have 5 wins from 5, which is not dissimilar to the 3 wins from 4 that he has from the tournaments that both players have played together this season.
1945	1945	9	10	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings. Jason Sobel: Brandt Snedeker ($10,000)  The winner of this event in 2013 and '15, he's looking to keep that odd-year streak going this week. Sneds isn't just a horse for these courses; he's also playing well right now, as evidenced by a title contention at Torrey Pines two weeks ago.
2320	2320	40	41	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t expect much different this week either. Beyond Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas, all the top ranked players in the field are internationals: Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Branden Grace, Russell Knox, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Francesco Molinari, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald and Thomas Pieters. We even get a quartet of Brits making the trek to America for the first time this year: Danny Willet, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ty Hatton and Ian Poulter.
9697	9697	0	1	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event. Although he known for being one of the longest drivers on the tour Woodland is also able to keep the ball in play. At this event, this has resulted in a T6, T13 and T3 the last three years here at the Sony Open.
2471	2471	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking. Garcia was excellent off-the-tee last week, but struggled mightily on the greens. He should be in for some positive regression this week.
8549	8549	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He followed that with a T15 at Memorial, T27 at The Open Championship and a T24 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. Day played well in this event over the last few years finishing T4 last year, a win in 2015 and a T2 in 2014. Statswise he ranks 23rd in driving distance, second in SG around the green, 47th in SGP and 17th in par 5 scoring.
8739	8739	32	32	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s now ranked 12th in Strokes Gained: Approaches among all the playoff runners and actually had a decent week of putting in Boston as he ranked T22 in Strokes Gained: Putting there. Grillo should also have gotten a boost of confidence from being selected as a President’s Cup captain’s pick recently for the international team. This is a good young golfer who is likely tired of seeing some of his peers outshine him recent weeks, and a big performance here would not shock me.
7912	7912	13	14	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(He's the Wild Card in the Fantasy Insider column.) But that's OK because Justin Rose is a suitable surrogate. At No.
10350	10350	21	21	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now he'll head to his old stomping grounds in Scottsdale, the area he played his college golf. After a tough Saturday, Rahm may have shifted his focus to Phoenix a bit early. Given his comfort in the area, I wouldn't be worried about any fatigue issues.
555	555	5	5	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only 8 measures rounds, but Rory is gaining 3.125 strokes Off the Tee + Approach per round. That's more than DJ &amp; Spieth COMBINED.
6382	6382	10	10	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his season stats may not jump off the page, Chappell has moved himself up into the top 40 in Strokes Gained: Approach and Tee to Green stats, and it’s his recent form I would emphasize here over his season stats. Chappell was third in both Strokes Gained: Approach and Tee to Green numbers in his second last start in Memphis, and in this weakened field a similar type of performance may see him get over the hump for the second time in the last couple of months. At $9,300, he’s also great value from a DraftKings perspective, as he’s only the seventh most expensive golfer this week, yet has the fourth highest Official World Golf Ranking in the field.
6889	6889	8	8	target: Stricker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since this event moved to Deere Run, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson, Kenny Perry and Jordan Spieth have won both tournaments and Tim Clark has come close to winning both, finishing runner-up in each event. Sean O'Hair, who won this tournament in 2005, finished tied for second in this year's Dean & Deluca alongside Deere Run specialist, Jordan Spieth, and the 2014 JDC winner, Brian Harman, finished tied for seventh alongside Stricker at this year's Dean & Deluca. Check out Valspar Championship form too as four men have won that tournament as well as this one - the aforementioned Spieth, John Senden, Sean O'Hair and Vijay Singh.
313	313	37	37	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He followed up a tied-5th showing at the Wyndham Championship with another top 20 at The Barclays on the fiendishly difficult Bethpage Black. So I am prepared to take a chance and have a small punt on Horschel at a best priced 66/1 to give us a run for our money. Brooks Koepka already knows he is going to Hazeltine.
12442	12442	11	12	target: Harold Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tway is someone I will manually adjust down my draft board. Harold Varner III (51.08 Projected Pts): At the start of the season this probably would have been a spot to circle HV3 since it's a long, par 72 which gives him four good chances per round to rack up birdies and eagles. However, he arrives with -31.1 strokes gained total in his last eight starts.
12175	12175	13	13	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he's converting on the greens, he has us at, "Cheers!" If both Woods and Rose are available to you, they might as well just line up as your picks for the API and the Masters in whichever quinella you prefer. We're treated to the steady contributions of Tommy Fleetwood and Alex Noren again this week, but they'll be there again for us at next week's Match Play where no one will want to square off against either.
715	715	4	4	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers I Love  Paul Casey ($11,600) – It’s going to be very difficult to fade Paul Casey after finishing no worse than fourth place in each of his last four starts. Last week at the Safeway Open, Casey totaled 109.5 FPTS on his was to a T3. He’s been continually knocking on the door of a win, and I don’t expect that trend to stop this week.
1028	1028	7	7	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
1795	1795	22	22	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
868	868	15	16	target: Jimmy Walker- 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am looking for him to continue his success this week with another top 10. Jimmy Walker-  Walker has owned this course in recent years with 3 top 12 finishes in the last 4 years, with a T-50 finish last year due to a final round 78, otherwise it could have been another nice result. Last season Walker finished top 25 in par 4 birdie or better scoring, T-17 in birdie average and 46th in strokes gained putting.
2604	2604	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play. At $400 less than Matsuyama, who will likely be more widely owned, the globe-trotting Swede is the play at the new venue.
7329	7329	15	15	target: Stricker- 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's played the Open only twice: T30 two years ago and T12 last year. Steve Stricker- $6,900 (150-1)    Stricker hasn't played the Open Championship much the past few years, but his T4 last year got him invited back. Top-25s at the Open used to be fairly regular for the now 50-year-old, including a T8 at Birkdale in 2008.
9555	9555	17	17	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DeChambeau does the other stuff pretty well. And if you want some odd connection, here it is: DeChambeau got here by winning the John Deere, and this tournament has been won four times by Deere winners in the past seven years: Spieth, Zach Johnson, Steve Stricker and Jonathan Byrd. (No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.)
4887	4887	31	31	target: O'Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I kind of welcome that because I think it would benefit me more for sure." The forecast this week is such that it should separate the men from the boys and O'Hair certainly has the skills to thrive when the trouser legs are flapping. His past course form is patchy but he does have T16 and T18 to his name and T34 last year (ninth after round one) was okay too.
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
6425	6425	22	22	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So we've seen an uplift in results with 26th at TPC River Highlands and 17th last week at TPC Potomac. In general DeChambeau is hitting the ball very nicely at the moment with his 300 yard driving game finding plenty of fairways. Ball-striking has also been strong across both of his last appearances.
9127	9127	125	125	target: Simpson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Patrick Cantlay; 2) Brian Stuard; 3) Luke List; 4) Gary Woodland; 5) Martin Laird; 6) Charley Hoffman / Vaughn Taylor; 8) Harold Varner III; 9) Ryan Armour; 10) Brandon Hagy / Adam Schenk / Bubba Watson; 13) Kevin Chappell / Matt Jones / Rob Oppenheim / Sam Saunders; 17) Corey Conners; 18) Alex Cejka / Brice Garnett / Chesson Hadley / William McGirt. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Tyrone Van Aswegen; 2) Tony Finau; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Chesson Hadley / Kevin Na; 6) Jonathan Randolph; 7) Kevin Chappell / Andrew Landry / Scott Piercy; 10) Derek Fathauer / Daniel Summerhays; 12) Joel Dahmen / Shawn Stefani; 14) Brice Garnett / Charley Hoffman / Morgan Hoffmann / Webb Simpson; 18) Rory Sabbatini; 19) Beau Hossler / Graeme McDowell; 21) Martin Laird. Winners & Prices : 2016: Pampling 300/1 ; 2015: Kaufman 250/1 ; 2014: Martin 225/1 ; 2013: Simpson 20/1 ; 2012: Moore 14/1 ; 2011: Na 60/1 ; 2010: Byrd 50/1 .
6164	6164	46	47	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The weather looks like it will be perfect this weekend, and I expect the players to take aim. We have a nice field for this event, including top 10 players Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day, as well as some other top 20 players like Paul Casey and Justin Thomas. Given the large amount of par 4s on the course, one of my stats of the week is birdie or better percentage on par 4s.
962	962	3	4	target: Si WOO 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RSMClassic Card 💰💰💰 Si WOO 66-1 Poston 75-1 Kang 100-1 Mitchell 150-1 Saunders 200-1 **Heavy On the T5 for Si Wo… https://t.co/rBUmrQ5leM
1554	1554	25	25	target: Na's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Na placed third at the CareerBuilder Challenge last season and was 48th in 2015, so there's some course history to examine with him this week. Na's stats also match up well with this course. Although he ranked only 93rd in Par 5 scoring last season, he ranked 2nd in approaches 125-150 yards, 11th in approaches 150-175 yards, and 2nd in SG:App.
5208	5208	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Picks and Sleepers  Rickie Fowler ($8,900)  Rickie Fowler is $8,900. For comparison, Patrick Reed is $9,200 and Brooks Koepka is $9,700 and are both ranked below Fowler in the OWGR. Rickie is a tough book to read.
4280	4280	30	30	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12033	12033	28	29	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
992	992	0	2	target: B. De Jonge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			B. De Jonge is a sleeper pick this week as he should be low owned and have an outside chance to win the event. I have mentioned Tommy Gainey before, but he has let me down….. so I won’t say anything about him this week.
3340	3340	9	9	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And his ownership in these events has been high. McIlroy has been much more valuable with odds of less than 10 percent: In 21 such tournaments since 2014, he has posted 86.4 PPT and a chunky 9.87 Plus/Minus with an amazing 71.4 percent Consistency. For the Masters, Rory currently checks in with the third-highest odds to win (11.8 percent).
9770	9770	45	45	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Henley, who won here five years ago in his first PGA Tour event, is the only winner since 1996 not to have played Waialae Country Club at least twice previously and he was the first winner in his 20s since Paul Stankowski in 1997. Thomas has since won in his 20s but every winner since Henley has also played here at least twice but course form isn't vital. Gomez's course form figures read MC-67-MC prior to his 2016 victory, when Jimmy Walker took the title the first time, in 2014, his figures read MC-61-32-MC-4-MC-26, and in 2012, Johnson Wagner won with previous course form numbers that read 34-MC-MC-MC-MC.
3453	3453	9	10	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be a great target in gpps this week. Bill Haas ($7,200): Haas is a player I’m very high on this week. He’s made seven straight cuts at Augusta and hasn’t finished worse than 24th here over the last four years.
2613	2613	1	1	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Dufner … The American version of Westwood in that he also makes his living as a sharpshooter tee to green. With top 25s in his last two starts, Dufner has picked up where he left off last year when he totaled six top 10s. Has five career top 10s in 14 stroke-play WGCs.
1013	1013	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Also like: Kevin Chappell and Charles Howell III. Chappell had a breakout campaign last season and that included a runner-up finish at Sea Island.
5434	5434	20	20	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell could easily fall between the cracks as he is competing with this week’s chalk, Kyle Stanley at $8,400. If Chappell hadn’t won a few weeks back at the Valero Texas Open, I honestly believe this would be the event we all would be saying was his to win. William McGirt – $7,300  Why is nobody talking about McGirt?!
7870	7870	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can. EXPERT ROB BOLTON , Fantasy Columnist LINEUP | BENCH Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth It’s all about rationing starts right now. So, with no cut at Firestone, there’s no urgency to burn one on Spieth.
2254	2254	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s 67.9 LT Adj Rd Score, 314.0-yard LT DD, and 16.7 LT Adj Bird Avg all rank second, and his 69.8 percent LT GIR is 12th. Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No.
8946	8946	9	10	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But a number of other big-name players will feature. Paul Casey, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Branden Grace, Thomas Pieters, Ian Poulter and Charl Schwartzel are all on the start sheet. Branden Grace swing sequence:  This will be the eighth time the CIMB Classic has featured on the PGA Tour.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
7920	7920	31	31	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a Recent Scrambling percentage of 69.2, which could come in handy at Firestone. Again, I would be surprised if any golfer exceeds 30 percent ownership — even DJ or Spieth — but Hoffman will likely be the chalkiest value golfer of the week. The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance.
1022	1022	25	26	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
7121	7121	53	53	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Aussie isn’t having his best season, but has been finding form recently. He’s posted Top 10s in two of his last five starts, and sits inside the Top 20 versus the field in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, SG: Approach, SG: Off-The-Tee, and in Par 3 efficiency from the key range of 175-200 yards… Grace has never missed a British Open cut, despite a lack of top end results. But his fate will be tied to the weather.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
1151	1151	0	0	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/5zPyi8BEyX
8444	8444	33	33	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
12101	12101	13	14	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He came T7 here last season after his T17 finish in his debut. Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds.
1200	1200	10	10	target: Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@DFSDiez @FantasyGolfMan Another good one to add to my list. Bozzelli finished 13th on the https://t.co/29SnY9yKZ0… https://t.co/f1oGgjugFD
119	119	46	47	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tournament Skill Averages :  Driving Distance: 32nd, Driving Accuracy: 22nd, Greens in Regulation: 12th, Proximity to Hole: 20th, Scrambling: 30th, Putting Average 27th. So let's take a view from players as to how Bethpage Black played at the 2012 Barclays and what specific skills it requires:  Bubba Watson : "I think it'll be a tough test. Again, that's the only time I've played it, so I don't know if they can firm up the greens.
6881	6881	36	36	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore ranked 34th for DD and 12th for DA. Jordan Spieth, who is missing the tournament for the second year in-a-row, has won two of the last four renewals because he's scrambled and putted brilliantly and Moore ranked first for Scrambling and sixth for Putting Average, but the secret to success here is usually relentlessly finding the putting surfaces. Greens In Regulation is the most important stat but how you play the par fives is key too.
5792	5792	8	8	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Opens. -- Matt Barrie  DraftKings value picks  Matt Kuchar  Kuchar is always a cash game play, especially at this price, but I really love how he's missed only one cut in a U.S. Open and Open Championship in the last six years. Ironically, he also owns only one top-10 in each of those majors during that same time span, so I'd stick with him in cash games and let others fall on the sword in GPPs this week, because he's sure to be chalky.
5574	5574	59	59	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
7517	7517	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If players can take advantage of the par fives they can see themselves in contention and you can see yourself in contention in DFS Contests. For reference, last year Dustin Johnson came second in the tournament losing by a stroke to Jhonattan Vegas. DJ was -11 for the tournament and played the par fives at -13 with 2 eagles for the week.
4104	4104	37	37	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best. A T11 finish at Augusta, following an improved performance in the Match Play give reason to believe Koepka can contend again. He has shown it for two rounds at the Phoenix Open, Bay Hill and the WGC down in Mexico, but struggled to put a full week together.
12789	12789	33	34	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five of the world's top 10 have already won in 2018, with Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy picking up victories as recently as the Florida Swing. Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late.
7645	7645	3	3	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Xander Schauffele at 125/1 Bet365 He shouldn’t be underestimated. Schauffele is a terrific driver of the ball, 19th in driving distance and 30th in strokes gained off the tee and his game reminds me past champion Keegan Bradley.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
6979	6979	49	49	target: Charley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With only 15 tags on FanShareSports, he has the third fewest out of anyone priced above $9K. Hoffman’s recent form is incredible, with an 8th place finish at the U.S. Open followed by a T3 at the Travelers. Maybe it only took a couple weeks off to forget what Charley has been up to?
2626	2626	13	14	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Jordan Spieth – $11,500  WGC events provide us with plenty of options at the top of the DraftKings pricing. In a field this small, it is impossible to fade any of them if you are building multiple lineups.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
2184	2184	25	25	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott will likely be my one-and-done pick this week as he has gone T-2, T-10 and T-17 in last three tries at Riviera. If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk.
9474	9474	36	36	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s even with his untimely stair-fall Augusta back injury that limited him quite badly as he wasn’t quite the same golfer until, of course, he shipped the Northern Trust in August. I can imagine that if Rahm looks at stat ranks, DJ is without question the stormy cloud that reminds him that he’s just not quite there yet. DJ gained an average of 1.002 OTT and .702 APR last year and, like Rahm, with only .104 gained ARG, he posted an absolutely disgusting 1.809 SG:T2G average per round.
708	708	14	15	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The most complete performances are rewarded with the most points. My roster  Fearsome foursome  Matt Kuchar  Emiliano Grillo  Jon Rahm  Kevin Na  Bench mob  Patrick Rodgers  Brendan Steele  Alternatives  Paul Casey  Justin Thomas  Grayson Murray  Kyle Reifers  Hudson Swafford  Harris English  • • •  Fore! Head to Golfweek.com for my entire archive as history never gets historical!
7110	7110	12	12	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m thinking the odds are in his favor. Sergio Garcia… Much like Fowler, he’s elite when it comes to playing in the elements. It’s no wonder he’s pieced together 10 top 10s in 20 Open Championship appearances.
5003	5003	14	14	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – DEAN & DELUCA Invitational  Lock of the week:  Sergio Garcia $10,800 – We absolutely love Sergio this week on a course that should set up well for a tremendous ball striker like he is. Strokes Gained off the Tee and Strokes Gained Approach are two of our favorite stat categories this week and Garcia is amongst the top 20 in the field in both. The Spaniard faltered a little on Sunday last week but had a tremendous back nine 29 on Saturday and is still on a heater coming off that Masters win in April.
1947	1947	29	29	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am going with a guy who seems motivated again, was in the mix two weeks ago in San Diego, and loves Pebble Beach, having won here before. When Snedeker won this event in 2015, he had kind of fallen off and was becoming a forgotten player. He was not qualified for the Masters, which we all know is his favorite tournament.

11670	11670	7	7	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day. In the shorter term though I feel a big week could be in the offing for him at the Valspar.
10879	10879	21	21	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He could be interesting at 125s. Shock Pebble Beach star Ted Potter Jr (125s) could ride the wave while Koreans KJ Choi (T26 at Pebble and brilliant record here including T5 in 2016) and Players Championship winner Si Woo Kim (68 in R2 last year despite MC) could also feature. Back up the price grid and Brendan Steele at 50s is a decent price in his home State and on greens he grew up on and I really like Alex Noren on this course which is perfect for his left-to-right ball flight but we've really ducked him at 35s.
1760	1760	46	46	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
4234	4234	46	47	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ben Martin has local ties and a win at Victoria National to his name, while Jonathan Randolph has twice been runner-up at the latter and arrives on the back of a couple of positive performances in Puerto Rico and Texas. However, last on my list is Patrick Reed, who is big enough to chance at 55/1. Reed has endured a pretty miserable spring, but he sounded bullish in the run-up to the Texas Open and started brightly there, before stumbling at the end of the first round and somehow missing the cut after a poor second.
3559	3559	41	41	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In Houston he led the SGTTG, SG approaches to the green and total birdies and was in the top 5 in GIR and putts per GIR, which are very favourable stats coming into this week. Despite missing the cut last year, Fowler has played well here finishing fifth in 2014 and 12th in 2015. He ranks 20th in GIR and ninth in strokes gained putting this season, two important stats for the lively greens of Augusta National.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
6720	6720	15	16	target: Brian Harman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 101st, Round 2: 16th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Brian Harman: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 3rd, Round 3: 1st. 2013 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 64th, Round 2: 19th, Round 3: 9th.
12215	12215	104	105	target: Patrick Reed. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
12576	12576	23	24	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best part about all of this is that he is priced right below Luke List who will soak up a ton of ownership. Matt Kuchar – $9,100  Kuch hasn’t been Mr.Reliable lately, failing to record a top 25 in his past four events, with the other three falling outside the top 40. He was heavily owned in Mexico where he came a disappointing T58.
4174	4174	12	12	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bar a lack of course experience, negatives begin and end with putting. Grace was very poor on the greens for much of last week’s Valero Texas Open and Oosthuizen was baffled by Augusta’s lightning surfaces, but this course has always been more about ball-striking (hence a list of poor-putting winners) and on that front perhaps only Stenson and Rose can be labelled superior to this pair. The Europeans are respected, but Stenson has gone right off the boil and Rose will be teeing it up for the first time since a heartbreaking Augusta defeat.
10026	10026	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer. And I say that as a good thing.
2367	2367	2	3	target: Cabrera Bello 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Rafa Cabrera Bello - This field has a strong international presence, and RCB has been playing well across the world so far in 2017. 6.
858	858	15	15	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - @THEPLAYERSChamp 2.5ew Garcia 18-1; 1ew Thomas 35-1, Matsuyama 25-1; 0.5ew Chappell 60-1, Fowler 22-1, Scott 45-1
5049	5049	28	29	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had though delivered 3 top-9 finishes and a further 2nd in the season prior to winning in Ohio. Last year saw World Number 65 Jason Dufner beat Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar and Justin Thomas to take his 5th PGA Tour victory at 66/1. Jason showed grit and resolve on a fast Sunday golf course, taking on the likes of 54-hole leader Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Thomas and playing partner Rickie Fowler to comfortably win in the end by 3 shots.
10733	10733	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk. Kirk is always a solid putter and relies on his irons, so take some GPP shares of Kirk this week.
565	565	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed Kaymer at 185/1. Poor record here, but playing well and likes the big event. Weather could produce a surprise winner like ZJ in 2007.
8940	8940	43	44	target: Gary Woodland; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) Jim Herman; 13) Paul Casey; 14) Graeme DeLaet / Richy Werenski; 16) Hao Tong Li / Brendan Steele; 18) Jason Dufner / Lucas Glover; 20) Rafael Cabrera-Bello. Greens in Regulation : 1) Paul Casey / Brendan Steele; 3) Graham DeLaet / Gary Woodland; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Stewart Cink; 7) Pat Perez / Harold Varner III; 9) Justin Thomas; 10) Bud Cauley; 11) Jason Dufner / Hudson Swafford; 13) Keegan Bradley / Luke List; 15) Hao Tong Li / Kyle Stanley; 17) Emiliano Grillo; 18) Scott Hend; 19) Martin Flores; 20) Grayson Murray. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Kevin Na; 4) Xander Schauffele; 5) Richy Werenski; 6) D.A.

7301	7301	13	13	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am willing to go with the field on this one and play Harman within my lineups. Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week.
2199	2199	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he loves Riviera, with six top 10s in nine starts. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama. Got a little rest after Phoenix, and how can continue his hot ways on a layout where he has had some nice success.
12100	12100	41	41	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.

1731	1731	13	13	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Football Outlook - Jeremy Chapman - Mexico 1.5ew Fleetwood 16-1, Rahm 12-1, Thomas 8-1, Johnson 13-2; 1ew Mi… https://t.co/5M5zYJSVkF
3015	3015	49	49	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tied 5th last year closing with a 71 to finish two shots behind play-off winner Tony Finau, the wind can be a major factor at the Coco Beach and the former champion plays some of his best golf in tough conditions. Along with his stellar record in Puerto Rico, Brown has posted top 5 finishes at both Harbour Town Golf Links and the Seaside Course at Sea Island. 10th at The Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens last year, he followed that up with a tied 7th place finish at the Valspar Championship.

7112	7112	17	18	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
8872	8872	17	18	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should I add anyone else once the market matures I'll update Twitter before the off. Recommended Bet  Chesson Hadley @ 60/1 (Sportsbook)    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
13198	13198	9	9	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
13395	13395	64	64	target: Piller 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His T4 here in 2016 only his second appearance at this course (T23 in 2011 on debut) but he has also shown form at the OHL Classic (T4 this season) to further justify his chances, so this is not based solely on that one standout performance here two years ago, nor is it about his love for all things Texas. On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title.
2634	2634	2	2	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$6,800 for Holmes is just way too cheap, especially when we are (almost) guaranteed 72 holes from him. Holmes is one of the best birdie makers in the field and will be flipping wedges into these greens all week long. He has been playing very consistent golf as of late, and is knocking on the door of a high finish.
12915	12915	23	24	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A performance that would lift a player above the seemingly numerous legitimate contenders at the front of the market. At the Houston Open, Jordan Spieth provided it. Spieth's record at Augusta National is extraordinary.
5231	5231	23	24	target: Pat Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stanley still has the stats that will work at Muirfield, so don’t let one missed cut push you off the bandwagon just yet. Pat Perez – $6,800  Now this is a perfect price for Pat Perez. The last couple of events he saw Perez’s price tag creep a little high for my liking, even though he was still playing well and the course fit his game.
9819	9819	54	54	target: Zach 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played well at the Safeway Open finishing a respectable T13 and followed that with a T23 at the OHL Classic. Johnson then travelled to Sea Island for the RSM Classic where he shot 64,67 over the weekend to finish T8 on 13 under par for the tournament so his current form looks decent. Zach has a great record here and really seems to have the game to fit this course.
732	732	42	43	target: Martin Laird; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan / Vaughn Taylor; 15) Roberto Diaz / Jonathan Randolph; 17) Charley Hoffman / Kevin Na; 19) Maverick McNealy; 20) Jon Curran / Rob Oppenheim. Greens in Regulation : 1) Patrick Cantlay; 2) Brian Stuard; 3) Luke List; 4) Gary Woodland; 5) Martin Laird; 6) Charley Hoffman / Vaughn Taylor; 8) Harold Varner III; 9) Ryan Armour; 10) Brandon Hagy / Adam Schenk / Bubba Watson; 13) Kevin Chappell / Matt Jones / Rob Oppenheim / Sam Saunders; 17) Corey Conners; 18) Alex Cejka / Brice Garnett / Chesson Hadley / William McGirt. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Tyrone Van Aswegen; 2) Tony Finau; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Chesson Hadley / Kevin Na; 6) Jonathan Randolph; 7) Kevin Chappell / Andrew Landry / Scott Piercy; 10) Derek Fathauer / Daniel Summerhays; 12) Joel Dahmen / Shawn Stefani; 14) Brice Garnett / Charley Hoffman / Morgan Hoffmann / Webb Simpson; 18) Rory Sabbatini; 19) Beau Hossler / Graeme McDowell; 21) Martin Laird.
2756	2756	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
12459	12459	1	1	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form. He showed signs of that in his last start, posting a top 10 at the Valspar.
11427	11427	28	28	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s due for a breakout on the North American stage, and perhaps a trip to Mexico is all he needs to get the monkey off his back. Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil.
6	6	31	31	target: Iwata 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look for Donald to make a statement in this event that he’s ready, willing, and able to start to reclaim his place in the sun. One from the Rough (Sleeper)  Hiroshi Iwata  He was in contention a few months ago at Pebble and almost captured his first PGA Tour win. After his big performance, Iwata registered back-to-back missed cuts, but his play is one that could be a great fit this week in Puerto Rico.
5071	5071	1	1	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings-wise, Fowler always makes a good play in the same vein as Lefty, because he makes lots of birdies. On par-5s, Fowler’s made Birdie or Better a whopping 55.83% (4th), and his overall birdie average of 4.44 is currently 4th on Tour. When going for the green, there’s no one better than Fowler who’s circled his scorecard 75.91% of the time he’s gone for it – tops.
7737	7737	62	62	target: Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend, Harry Diamond, will take over the reins for now so all we can do is wait and see but in the short term at least, from a punting perspective, yet another disruption has to be viewed as a negative. Selections  I was more than happy to take a small chance on Spieth and I'm also playing course debutant, Tommy Fleetwood, whose game has improved inexorably this year. Fleetwood finished 27th at the Open Championship two weeks ago and that was a disappointing effort given the form he's been in and that Birdkdale's his local links but I think that second fact was the big problem.
12241	12241	27	27	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
4850	4850	32	33	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			'Rahmbo' for me is a future World Number 1 who in all likelihood can win on any course, however 12/1 on a specialised track where experience pays like Colonial holds little appeal. Jason Dufner will be well-backed this week and is the first up for me. Tough, windy conditions will play to his strengths, as will fast conditions if they come into play.
842	842	10	10	target: KOEPKA 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
714	714	11	11	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Valero Texas Open - 2ew Chappell 33/1, 2ew Koepka 25/1; 1ew List 50/1
1048	1048	3	3	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm touting Wes Bryan Come hang in my @PowerHourDFS slack https://t.co/JYS9wono32
5941	5941	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect a thrilling finish and bounce backs from McIlroy and Day, who both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Russell Knox  2015 – Bubba Watson  2014 – Kevin Streelman  2013 – Ken Duke  2012 – Marc Leishman  2011 – Fredrik Jacobsen  2010 – Bubba Watson  2009 – Kenny Perry  2008 – Stewart Cink  2007 – Hunter Mahan    Key Stats to Winning at TPC River Highlands    • Par Breakers percentage  • Par 4 scoring average  • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green    Champion's Profile    With an interesting list of both short and long hitters claiming victories in the past, it is clear length has little to do with winning on one of the PGA Tour’s shortest courses. Plenty of shorter holes means birdies can come in bunches and are essential to success here, so look for players with high par-breaker percentages as quality candidates.
5565	5565	10	11	target: Kevin Kisner’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Confident. Those are five words that I’d use to describe Kevin Kisner’s game and also five words that I’d say are ideal qualities of a player poised to host our nation’s winning trophy. I was actually hoping that he would not win at Colonial a couple weeks ago, as I wanted him to stay extra under the radar heading into this week.
467	467	43	43	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mo Yoshimoto looks at everything you might have missed at Bethpage Black last week in his Barclays Recap. Now for the picks...    GolfChannel.com Fantasy Golf      Ryan O’Sullivan    @RyanGolfBlogger      2016 Earnings: $16,495,565  2016 Rank: 7,854 of 41,730    Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Charley Hoffman  Group 4: Sean O'Hair      ANALYSIS: Fowler, Day, and O'Hair were all right in the mix last week at Bethpage Black. Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston.
7176	7176	30	30	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
10622	10622	22	23	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a great venue for him to keep his hot play going and I'm happy to get involved at 35/1. Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price.
3684	3684	55	55	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stanley is 5th on Tour in that category which goes along with his 12th ranking in SG: Approach, 6th in SG: Tee to Green, and 7th in Proximity to the Hole. He’s a stud in all facets of the game on his way to the green, which is the one spot where he falters – Stanley sits 175th on Tour in SG: Putting, and concerning is that his worst putting has come on Bermuda this season. All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he’ll be in contention.
1209	1209	12	13	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Career Builder Challenge Webb Simpson 20/1 Chesson Hadley 50/1 JJ Spaun 65/1 David Lingmerth 66/1 Scott Piercy 80/1… https://t.co/pWakq5RrXy
11437	11437	13	14	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Dustin Johnson – $11,900  Boring I know, but whenever DJ is in the field playing at a course he has won at before, it’s so tough not to load up. There is only so much that can be said about DJ before it becomes copy and paste from the week prior.
157	157	0	1	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend. Although this is his first appearance here in Bethpage, Grace ticks a few key boxes here ranking fourth in SG approach to the green, ninth in SGTTG and 19th in par 4 scoring.
3478	3478	50	50	target: Holmes’ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It took a final round 68 to shoot up the leaderboard here last year, but 74 was his worst round of the week showing he played four pretty steady rounds on this tough course. With soft conditions possible, after heavy rain Monday which may be followed with more on Thursday, Holmes’ distance off the tee could be vital. Holmes missed his first cut since last August in Houston last week, but he wasn’t alone, with players such as Spieth, Adam Scott and Patrick Reed also missing the cut in what was a strange, weather-affected Houston Open.
539	539	2	2	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
1846	1846	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here.
3590	3590	22	23	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think he has a legitimate shot to win this tournament if he keeps the ball near the hole on his approaches. Daniel Berger is coming off a solid week at the Shell Open and looks to continue his fine play at the Masters. Berge is a solid player in every category, but does a great job on the green which should help him have a strong run at Augusta.
13552	13552	22	22	target: Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I don't think he's a bad play here but I have two other options I like. That leaves me with Steele and Hoffman. Hoffman grades out better in total course history, current form, and is only slightly worse in long-term performance.
613	613	28	29	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey offers some solid cash relief off of the top guys and definitely has shown he can contend with the best in the world. Don’t be shocked if Paul Casey ends up lifting the FedEx Cup trophy come Sunday. Si Woo Kim – $6,700  Since I believe stars and scrubs will be a popular approach to building lineups this week, I think Si Woo Kim will be one of the least popular golfers in the sub $7K range.
2621	2621	10	10	target: Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nobody hits a 3-wood with more confidence and accuracy than Stenson. Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.
3574	3574	9	9	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Factor in driving, and he's 54th in ball striking. Dufner missed the cut two of the past three years, but he's a better golfer now. He notched top-25s in 2012 and '13.
2102	2102	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
10025	10025	2	2	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
5469	5469	4	4	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would certainly describe Fowler, who also sits 1st in the All-Around stats which measure driving, irons, bunker play, putting, scoring and birdie/eagle ranking. So, could Fowler be the latest to debunk the myth that you have to be a renowned straight hitter to win the US Open? It may be a shrewd move to try and take the counter-intuitive route again and back him.
1587	1587	8	8	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Qatar Masters: Smith @55s - 1.65pts e/w #hondaclassic: Kirk @100s - 0.95pts e/w (8 places with Sky)
10544	10544	25	25	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident. As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh.
7686	7686	35	36	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're looking for a longshot, here's your guy. Pinterest Richard Sellers - PA Images  Expert's Picks  Justin Rose  Marc Leishman  Jordan Spieth  Thomas Pieters  Justin Thomas  Rickie Fowler  Tommy Fleetwood  Rory McIlroy  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Expert's Explanation: Don't sweat the change in caddie ; Rory will be fine. For all the fuss made about his Royal Birkdale roller coaster, man still finished T-4.
10204	10204	35	36	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas scares me in cash games, but I totally understand the play if you want to use him in those, as well. -- Taras Pitra  Editor's Picks Weekly 18: Rory McIlroy came back strong, will Tiger Woods do so, too? Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.
386	386	5	5	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here. Everything is trending in the right direction for Day. Jordan Spieth  Vegas Odds - 12/1  Draftkings - $11,600  FantasyAces - $6,000    Spieth is starting to heat up and is on the brink of winning once again.
5049	5049	28	29	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had though delivered 3 top-9 finishes and a further 2nd in the season prior to winning in Ohio. Last year saw World Number 65 Jason Dufner beat Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar and Justin Thomas to take his 5th PGA Tour victory at 66/1. Jason showed grit and resolve on a fast Sunday golf course, taking on the likes of 54-hole leader Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Thomas and playing partner Rickie Fowler to comfortably win in the end by 3 shots.
3813	3813	36	37	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Morgan Hoffmann ($7,000): With local ties to the area and a recent career-best at the Honda Classic, Hoffmann has a lot of potential but I'm keeping on the front end since he's not the safest option. Jason Dufner ($8,300): Is playing steady golf this season. He's been inside the top 30 thru 36 holes in 9 of his last 10 starts, so you know where I'll be placing him this week.
1115	1115	9	9	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@RBaroff427 I can assure you one thing. I have Ollie bet every way possible and always do!
934	934	1	2	target: Harris English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Harris English -- English is a former winner here in 2013, and he was T-4 in Vegas, and he's a cut-making machine. Usually good for plenty of points, but hard to recommend for a win.
950	950	15	15	target: Laird, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not walking out on any thin-limbs this week, but 7k guys I prefer: Streelman, Cink, Laird, Cook, &amp; Tway Will be h… https://t.co/7L4lUOsO9J
6569	6569	29	30	target: Danny Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With his price, I’d expect high ownership but Finau is not a player I want to fade this week as I think he sets up great for this event. Danny Lee – Cash – DK: $9500 FD: $8400  Last week I picked Danny Lee and discussed how he is the type of player that consistently plays well when he shows good form; this week I see no reason to jump off the train. Lee combines good form with great course history (defending champion) and although he will see high ownership he is a lock for me in any cash game format.
439	439	3	4	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
11212	11212	5	5	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top-5 finishers last year:  1.Rickie Fowler  T2. Morgan Hoffmann  T2 Gary Woodland  T4 Wesley Bryan  T4 Chad Collins  T4 Tyrell Hatton  T4 Billy Horschel  T4 Martin Kaymer  T4 Jhonattan Vegas  Standout performers over last five years:  Rickie Fowler  Graeme McDowell  Sergio Garcia  Ryan Palmer  Adam Scott  Going Streaking: Players entering this week in great form  1. Rickie Fowler (DraftKings $11,700, FanDuel $12,300: Rickie will look to earn his ticket back to the Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the same way he did last year, by winning the Honda Classic.
1399	1399	35	36	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High-value Englishmen Justin Rose ($9.3m) and Paul Casey ($9.5m) don't make the top 10 of the predictor model either. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Cody Gribble ($6.8m); 2: Daisuke Kataoka ($6.4 m); 3: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 4: Ryan Blaum ($7m); 5: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 6: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 7: Justin Rose ($9.3m); 8: Charles Howell III ($7.8m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($8.3m); 10: Branden Grace ($7.5m). Positives: Ryan Blaum stands out on a FPPG basis, ranking fourth across the Sony field for a mere $7m.
9089	9089	11	11	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much to the bemusement of European Tour and Team Europe fans, Casey decided to count himself out of the running for Team Europe at both the 2014 and 2016 Ryder Cup’s. Casey did not agree with the qualifying criteria and would not commit to the required number of European Tour events to make the team. This caused quite a stir amongst the golfing community, as a player of his talent could really help Europe’s cause against the Americans.
11559	11559	41	42	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
1650	1650	5	5	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However we do know that Walker comes to the fore on classical layouts and that he loves Poa Annua greens. Walker, like Woods and Snedeker before him, is a natural putter and that works well on these greens. Since 2012, Walker's record at Torrey Pines reads 8th, 4th, MC, 7th and 4th.
1765	1765	25	26	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.7m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 3: Brendan Steele ($8.2m); 4: Bubba Watson ($8.3m); 5: Ryan Moore ($8.6m); 6: Phil Mickelson ($8.4m); 7: Gary Woodland ($9.0m); 8: Russell Knox ($7.5m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($7.1m); 10: Brooks Koepka ($9.1m). Predictor Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select at $8.6 million and there's more detail on him in the FPPG section below.
8768	8768	5	6	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley. Winners & Prices : 2016: McIlroy 13/2 ; 2015: Spieth 9/1 ; 2014: Horschel 25/1 ; 2013: Stenson 16/1 ; 2012: Snedeker 40/1 ; 2011: Haas 45/1 ; 2010: Furyk 20/1 ; Average: 23/1.
9065	9065	49	49	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fleetwood's lead was cut by Sergio Garcia on Sunday and the Englishman is absolutely determined to earn his place in the history books, which he deserves for his performances at all levels throughout 2017. With Garcia not in the field this week my belief that it means more to Fleetwood is strengthened and he could strike a decisive blow. His record at Sheshan doesn't leap off the page but three top-30 finishes from as many visits looks good to me, especially as he was nowhere near the level he's at now.
9535	9535	16	16	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia and Henrik Stenson are the only qualifiers taking a pass. Last year, Thomas bombed (and finessed) his way to a three-stroke win over Matsuyama. Ten golfers are back from the 2017 field, but only three have played the last two years – Thomas, 2016 champion Spieth and Johnson, who won in 2013.
12507	12507	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Be aggressive. Phil Mickelson: "The style of play here is totally different than Augusta. The rope is at 300 yards or so off the tee, everything pitches in here and every tee shot has a hazard in play.
4738	4738	36	36	target: Kang 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be very popular this week, as he has the second most tags on FanShareSports.com, but I am will to put Finau in 40-50% of my lineups this week to create the required separation. Sung Kang – $7,400  Why not make it two consecutive wins for South Koreans? Even without the Si Woo Kim bump, Sung Kang would have been a fantastic play this week, as he enters the Byron Nelson with second best recent form other than DJ.
10531	10531	77	78	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Time to rebound this week in the desert. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Hideki Matsuyama (T4-T2-WIN-WIN)  J.J. Spaun (T4)  Webb Simpson (6-for-7 with five top 15s)  Rickie Fowler (7-for-9 with three top 5s)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T9)  Byeong Hun An (6th)  Zach Johnson (6-for-7 with four top 15s)  Shane Lowry (T6-T16)  Jon Rahm (T5-T16)  Brendan Steele (7-for-7 with five Top 20s)  Phil Mickelson (22-for-28 with THREE WINS)  Kevin Na (11-for-12 with eight top 30s)  Matt Kuchar (6-for-8 with two top 10s)  Bubba Watson (9-for-11 with six top 15s)  Daniel Berger (T10-T58-T7)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Rickie Fowler  Hideki Matsuyama  Matt Kuchar  Justin Thomas  Phil Mickelson  Marc Leishman  Francesco Molinari  Brandt Snedeker  Austin Cook  Steve Stricker  Zach Johnson  Patrick Reed  Daniel Berger    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, and Daniel Berger.
983	983	3	3	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My man A. Cook may be worth a bit as well.
11573	11573	23	23	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Throughout the Euro Tour’s 2017 season, Fisher ranked fourth in GIR percentage and ended sixth in the Race to Dubai. Bargain Bin    Kevin Chappell - $14,100    Not a bad price for someone who ranks fourth on Tour in SG: Tee-to-Green and 10th in scrambling, but he’ll need to improve with the flat stick in order to have any shot at winning this week. Despite his putting troubles, Chappell has managed to finish top-20 in five of his past eight starts due to such quality ball-striking.
13579	13579	19	19	target: Frittelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This season Streelman ranks 11th in total driving, 18th in SG: T2G and fourth in scrambling. Bargain Bin    Dylan Frittelli - $13,400    Frittelli will be making his Valero Texas Open debut this week, but the South African is familiar with the Texan style of golf after playing collegiately as a Longhorn at UT-Austin. The 51st-ranked player in the OWGR doesn’t enter with very inspiring recent form after finishes of T32-MC-MC in his past three starts, but he led the field in SG: Off-the-Tee and ranked 10th in SG: T2G at Harbour Town last week.
138	138	20	20	target: Rose's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He deservedly won Gold, but what makes me think he will continue to play well this week at Bethpage? Well Rose's CV contains 5 'Up-State' wins across Muirfield, Aronimink, Cog Hill, Merion and Congressional. Tough, classical golf courses where he comes to the fore - indeed Justin tops my rolling technical golf course scoring category across the past 5 years ahead of DJ, Spieth (since 2013 only - amazing) and Scott.
12039	12039	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jason Day, $12500 – Day enters rested after a win and runner-up his last two starts on TOUR. He paces the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and is plenty long enough to score on the par-5s this week.
9992	9992	31	31	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The roll-of-honour in the CareerBuilder Challenge, which takes in three courses before a 54-hole cut determines which players can have another crack at one of them, tells you a lot. Although Mickelson features twice and Arnold Palmer used to win it every other year, names like Mark Wilson, Brian Gay and even Hudson Swafford confirm that this is something of a Tier 2 event. This is a good thing and there is some temptation to simply row in with Rahm given that he appears to have little to beat and has enjoyed a rise so meteoric that double-figure prices look generous.
6115	6115	1	1	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place. At some point I expect Wes Bryan to bounce back, and why not this week on a course that plays to Bryan’s strengths? Wes Bryan has the game to win an event like this and is going to be my super sleeper to win here  Click To Enlarge!
7416	7416	38	38	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey. RESULT: T62  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  We were on board Ollie Schniederjans as recently as Old White TPC and despite a very strange WD there for a scoring card signing infringement, I'm still very much of the opinion that Ollie is a player to watch right now. His last performance at the John Deere Classic was far better as he co-led after shooting a flawless -8/63 on Thursday and backed that up with a -5/66 to get back in contention.
10283	10283	58	59	target: 2016—Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There doesn’t appear to be a huge advantage in stacking tee times at the moment; although, if one of the first two days’ forecasts improves a bit, it might be better to have your player on the South course when the weather is better. Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top-10 performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016).
12928	12928	14	14	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley has progressive Masters form of MC-31-21-11 and was T8 in Houston last week. Johnson is a former Green Jacket winner (also T9 in 2015) whose game doesn't look far away after T26 at Bay Hill and T16 in the Valspar. Hadwin has strokeplay form of 6-9-12 and was a creditable T36 on his Masters debut last year.
5785	5785	129	262	target: Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B. Holmes +10000 +10000 Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
4641	4641	19	19	target: Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although his Strokes Gained numbers are uglier than expected, a large part of that comes from the fact that Blair just doesn’t drive the ball far – he’s averaging 271 yards off the tee this season. As a shorter hitter both with the driver and his irons, Blair can’t seem to catch up on the field at longer courses, which on paper makes him look atrocious – but he is deadly accurate, so it’s not all bad. In fact, Blair currently sits 13th in Par-4 Scoring (3.98 average), which is the bread and butter of the week.
1200	1200	26	27	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Russell Knox; 3) Brendan Steele; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Branden Grace / Bubba Watson; 8) Justin Thomas / Jhonattan Vegas; 10) Daniel Berger; 11) William McGirt; 12) Ryan Moore. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Pat Perez; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Ryan Moore; 5) Russell Knox; 6) Patrick Reed; 7) Dustin Johnson; 8) Daniel Berger; 9) Brandt Snedeker; 10) Cody Gribble; 11) Si Woo Kim; 16) Branden Grace. Winners & Prices : 2016: Spieth 5/1 ; 2015: Reed 22/1 ; 2014: Zach Johnson 14/1 ; 2013: Dustin Johnson 14/1 ; 2012: Stricker 17/2 ; 2011: Byrd 50/1 ; 2010: Ogilvy 9/1 ; Average: 18/1.
6589	6589	21	21	target: List. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tight with tough to hit greens and penalizing areas around the green. That is not the ideal course set up for List. However, Old White TPC course is.
6003	6003	1	2	target: David Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. David Lingmerth, $7,900  After a poor start to the season, Lingmerth has found the form that made the 29-year-old one of the game’s most interesting prospects in 2015-16. The Swede has four top-21 finishes in his last five events, smashing salary-based expectation each time.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
2117	2117	20	20	target: Laird’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
9523	9523	17	18	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scores are incredibly low year-in and year-out. Winning scores are almost always in the 20s-under par and Jordan Spieth even shot 30-under in 2016. The course is candy to a big hitter’s eye as it has big wide-open fairways and a whole lot of elevation change.
11212	11212	4	5	target: 1.Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top-5 finishers last year:  1.Rickie Fowler  T2. Morgan Hoffmann  T2 Gary Woodland  T4 Wesley Bryan  T4 Chad Collins  T4 Tyrell Hatton  T4 Billy Horschel  T4 Martin Kaymer  T4 Jhonattan Vegas  Standout performers over last five years:  Rickie Fowler  Graeme McDowell  Sergio Garcia  Ryan Palmer  Adam Scott  Going Streaking: Players entering this week in great form  1. Rickie Fowler (DraftKings $11,700, FanDuel $12,300: Rickie will look to earn his ticket back to the Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the same way he did last year, by winning the Honda Classic.
4233	4233	19	20	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smylie Kaufman at 500/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - speculative but better on last solo start and may surprise  1pt e.w. Patrick Reed at 55/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - good signs in last two starts and more prolific than most of these  Owing to the fact that regular venue Quail Hollow will host this year's PGA Championship, Eagle Point, on the North Carolina coast, steps in to ensure the Wells Fargo can go ahead as scheduled. Like Quail Hollow, this Tom Fazio design is a relatively meaty par 72 and while seldom do players and officials criticise a venue, the praise for this one has been stronger than usual.
4863	4863	47	48	target: Jason Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Amazingly Jon Rahm heads the betting, which is a measure of his meteoric rise along with the lack of strength in depth in the field. The Spaniard is a class act but I think the title might be heading to another elite ball-striker in the shape of Jason Dufner. Twice a runner-up at Colonial he finished T6 last year and it’s clearly a course he gets on well with.
11856	11856	28	28	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his career success at Heritage hasn’t translated to Valspar yet, the South African’s knack for smacking quality irons and saving himself around the greens should translate perfectly. Grace lost strokes on his approaches in Mexico for the first time all season, yet he continued his season-long trend of saving pars from missed GIRs. If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa.
5594	5594	21	22	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
3817	3817	1	1	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas – $9,100  Boring Bill Haas is flying under the radar once again. Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green.
3823	3823	4	4	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			16. Other than that, Kuchar has been surprisingly off this year with a T-9 in Phoenix being his only other top 10. Considering he has a win, a fifth and a T-9 at Harbour Town, he's the safest bet for a big week here.
1345	1345	36	36	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranked 50th in putts inside 10', 44th in putts 10'-15', and 30th in putts 15'-20' last season, which makes him one of the best putters within our putting key stat. Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us.
8178	8178	21	21	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can keep it going on the greens, he very well could win a second week in a row. Like Fowler, Matsuyama has never won a major, but he doesn't carry nearly the baggage that Fowler does. Tier 2 Values    Matt Kuchar - $8,800 (50-1)    While we picked four of the top-5 guys on the DraftKings board in Tier 1, we're dropping way down in price for Tier 2, bypassing the low-$10,000 and all the $9,000 guys, including Brooks Koepka.
5747	5747	3	3	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts. With his mother’s health improved and his own health no longer an issue, Day seems to be playing much freer of late and for that reason alone I’d not be shocked at all if he put it all together here and won his second major.
2895	2895	16	16	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should he straighten out his driver, he looks in good shape. Despite struggling with the driver, Koepka still ranks 4th in Par 5 Birdie or Better and T7 in Par 5 scoring average. As well as still playing the par-5’s well, he has also played the long par-3’s well.
8489	8489	27	27	target: Reed's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, although this week's first leg is a tournament with a new name and at a new course, we can be confident that the location should suit. Reed's win at The Barclays came at Bethpage State Park last year while his previous top 10 was at Ridgewood. This week's Northern Trust (not to be confused with their sponsorship of the Los Angeles event played at Riviera) heads to Glen Oaks Club - a par 70 that plays 7,350 from the tips.
5881	5881	22	23	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finishing position in brackets:  2016: Russell Knox -10 (Winner); Jerry Kelly (2nd) Shawn Stefani (11th) -9; Tyrone Van Aswegen (5th) -8. 2015: Bubba Watson -12 (Winner); Bo Van Pelt (7th) -10; Paul Casey (2nd) -9; Curran (10th), Delaet (4th), Gore (10th), Harman (3rd), Pettersson (5th) -8. 2014: Kevin Streelman (Winner), Brandt Snedeker (11th) -11; K.J.
2202	2202	24	25	target: Hideki Matsuyama, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
8139	8139	22	23	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can see him being highly owned, but he is cash worthy no matter how highly touted he is, in my opinion. Gary Woodland $6,700 – Played awful Thursday and Friday of last week, but bounced back decently well on the weekend with a 69 on Sunday. He hits it long enough and should have less ownership than he would’ve with a good showing last week.
7343	7343	15	16	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That sounds right up Matsuyama's alley. EXPERT JONATHAN WALL , Equipment Insider LINEUP | BENCH Jordan Spieth  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Adam Scott  Sergio Garcia  Dustin Johnson  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth Spieth will embrace the difficult test this week at Royal Birkdale. Doesn't hurt that he recorded a win in his previous start.
12312	12312	64	65	target: Shubhankar Sharma 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Chez Reavie and Keegan Bradley await in the group stages with the Thai likely to present the biggest obstacle to progression, however Rahm is a truly world-class player who can bully players in this format and should he make it through to a head-to-head with Rory in the quarter-finals then my money would be on the Spaniard to progress. RESULT: Group Stage  Shubhankar Sharma 0.5pt EW 100/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins. 18+, T&Cs apply*.
4830	4830	114	115	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Tony Finau; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Sergio Garcia; 5) Lucas Glover; 6) Marc Leishman; 7) Jason Dufner / Emiliano Grillo / J.J. Henry; 10) Ryan Palmer / Jon Rahm; 12) Adam Hadwin; 13) Xander Schauffele; 14) Charley Hoffman / Kevin Tway; 16) Matt Kuchar; 17) Chad Campbell / Stewart Cink; 19) Ollie Schniederjans / Harold Varner III; 21) Ben Martin / Boo Weekley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Steve Stricker; 2) Sam Saunders; 3) Blayne Barber / Bud Cauley; 5) Jason Dufner; 6) Patton Kizzire; 7) Pat Perez; 8) Sergio Garcia / Brian Harman / David Lingmerth; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Wesley Bryan / Chris Kirk / Seung-yul Noh; 15) Aaron Baddeley / Jordan Spieth; 17) Billy Hurley III; 18) Danny Lee; 19) Zac Blair / Emiliano Grillo; 21) Paul Casey / Cameron Smith / Brian Stuard / Vaughn Taylor. Winners & Prices : 2016: Spieth 7/1 ; 2015: Kirk 35/1 ; 2014: Scott 18/1 ; 2013: Weekley 100/1 ; 2012: Z Johnson 16/1 ; 2011: Toms 33/1 ; 2010: Z Johnson 50/1 .
11802	11802	53	54	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach. -- Zach Turcotte  Kevin Na  Nobody fits the Valspar Championship mold quite like Na. He's accurate off the tee, he is an elite wedge player, and he has a solid short game.
5837	5837	8	9	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s break down the field! The Favorites…  Rickie Fowler – Player with the most balanced bag in the field goes right back to the top after missing the cut in Memphis. Fowler checks in #2 SG: Total highlighted by his excellent putting and short game.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
4150	4150	21	22	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
2082	2082	39	40	target: Hideki Matsuyama, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The PGA Tour moves from Northern California to Los Angeles for the Genesis Open, the former L.A. Open, at Riviera Country Club. Bubba Watson is defending champion in the best field of 2017 to date, which includes Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama, Jason Day and Dustin Johnson. For those new to our weekly picks, we offer our top 10 players for free.
6424	6424	2	3	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: DQ  Bryson DeChambeau 0.75pt EW 90/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Bryson DeChambeau is a little like a box of chocolates, you just never know what you are going to get. However, this is the kind of low-key tournament where a talent like DeChambeau could fire, challenge and more than likely take the title. If we're looking for a motive, it appears that Bryson has noticed that he's outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and clearly he doesn't want to go through the stress of the web.com Playoffs again.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
1628	1628	30	30	target: Snedeker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one shot adrift when play resumed on the Monday, but winds from the opposite direction meant Jimmy Walker, Kevin Streelman and most notably KJ Choi failed to better Snedeker. Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year.
11831	11831	71	72	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's had a bit of a break and just turned 40 and I just wonder if that significant milestone might inject a bit of impetuous. He's a risky play but at a triple-figure price he's well worth the risk and last but not least, I've thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned John Deere Classic winner, Bryson DeChambeau. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [25.0]  Jason Dufner @ [85.0]  Ollie Schniederjans @ [95.0]  Zach Johnson @ [110.0]  Bryson DeChambeau @ [130.0]  I'll be back later with the Hero Indian Open preview.
12071	12071	1	2	target: Bradley/Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth. They’re generating beaucoup birdie tries, and that’s what you want at Bay Hill.
1168	1168	2	3	target: Dominic Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like Dominic Bozzelli at the Career Builder at a price. 5th here last year. Top 40 last week at Sony closing 6… https://t.co/a40lM7Lyp1
11587	11587	11	11	target: Casey. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I also expect a big run from his fellow Englishman Paul Casey. Casey's top 10 numbers over the last year easily justify a punt at [3.6] and his results show a couple of T11s and a T13 in there too so he really is giving backers a great run just about every time he pegs it up. His weekend scores of 67-66 at this event last year meant he played the final two rounds one stroke lower than winner Dustin Johnson so he can definitely make hay around this track.
9081	9081	45	45	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose was favourite for this event in 2014, following his 5th and 7th place finishes in his first two trips to Sheshan International, as well as his three 4th place finishes in his last six starts leading into the event. It wasn’t to be for Rose that week though as he limped to a disappointing 48th place finish, much below his usual high standards. It has been a strange season for Rose, with injury problems playing their part.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
8219	8219	58	59	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was awesome at Royal Birkdale but will a long, wet Quail Hollow allow his brilliance to shine through in the same way as it did on that classic links? Last four events: 13-1-1-35  Quail Hollow record: 32  US PGA record: 13-2-MC-MC  Last 10 majors: 1-35-11-13-30-37-2-2-4-1  Last 50 starts - Win: 14%, Top 5: 34%, Top 10: 48%      Rory McIlroy    Despite being the least showbiz of the four, the US PGA has actually been McIlroy's best major. And now he has a seemingly golden chance to win a third Wanamaker trophy having won twice previously at this course, the first in spectacular style.
896	896	4	5	target: Charley Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So you never know. Charley Hoffman. OK, his form coming in is troublesome to say the least (he’s missed his first two cuts of the 2016-17 PGA Tour season).
11606	11606	27	28	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At least he's aware of and willing to confront the issue, rather than making excuses; to me that looks like a step in the right direction. Interview: Paul Casey 'buzzing like a young pro' to be back on European Tour with a Ryder Cup place in his sights https://t.co/UOoefzi2bi — Telegraph Sport (@TelegraphSport) January 16, 2018  Casey ended the interview by stating "you could say we are highly-motivated, yes" and with form at altitude including at Crans, this golf course looks one of the more suitable in the run-up to Augusta, where he also tends to play well. I know full well that won't do for everyone and I'm usually keen to take on players with his strike-rate, but this is one rare occasion I can't resist.
6271	6271	26	26	target: Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One angle that will be played up this week is that the web.com Tour hosted events here in 2012 and 2013. One of the winners, David Lingmerth, is in this field and gaining steam in the industry. Not only is Lingmerth in great form, but clearly he’ll have positive memories to draw upon.
9840	9840	40	44	target: Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Kyle Stanley; 2) Ryan Armour / Russell Henley / Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Chez Reavie; 7) Jordan Spieth; 8) Colt Knost / William McGirt; 10) Kevin Na; 11) Austin Cook; 12) Ben Martin; 13) Steve Wheatcroft; 14) Kevin Kisner; 15) Justin Thomas; 16) Tyler Duncan / J.J.

5673	5673	21	22	target: Russell Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This market is deep and I'm happy to leave it alone. There are only three in the Top Scot market - Russell Knox, Martin Laird and Richie Ramsay and I'm more than happy to take the 11/8 about Knox. Ramsay's home course is Royal Aberdeen so he might take to Erin Hills but he's not in great form and nor is Laird.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
330	330	6	6	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
13091	13091	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t putt. The last time Scott gained strokes on the green was at the WGC Bridgestone last July. Not great, Bob.
803	803	8	8	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.
5319	5319	11	12	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The less our players have to scramble the better. Core Plays  Rickie Fowler ($12,000) – Never thought I would see the day that I pay $12,000 for Rickie Fowler. That is the kind of year this guy is having though.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
10785	10785	73	74	target: Shane Lowry. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The organisers tend to shape the draw so that the top players play consecutive rounds around Pebble on the weekend and if they do so again and Saturday ends up being really blustery, the current market leaders could get the worst of the draw. Wary of the draw and weather forecast, I'm not prepared to invest much at this stage but I'm happy to play two for small stakes - Chez Reavie and Shane Lowry. Reavie played well on Sunday and he was arguably unlucky to bump in to a red-hot Gary Woodland but he can contend again here and maybe gain some immediate compensation for his playoff defeat, despite not having fabulous course form to boast.
6198	6198	76	76	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			37th in Bogey Avoidance and 33rd in par-4 Birdie or Better Conversion makes plenty of sense this week, but I also like his 84th in Scrambling, 9th in Scrambling from 20-30 yards and 63rd in Strokes Gained Putting. Yes, his short game is underestimated and at a tournament where he finished 11th in 2014 over the road at Congressional Country Club when in worse form than he is right now, I can see the Par 70-positive Horschel loving the TPC Potomac challenge this week. Result: T26  Xander Schauffele 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I'm sure that Xander Schauffele would like to earn an invite to the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and based on his current play that's more than a distinct possibility.
600	600	11	11	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Would be nice if I could see if I can fit Dufner Perez Kisner in every lineup this week.
3679	3679	27	27	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
4568	4568	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It sure looks like it. According to FanShareSports.com, Day is the 29th most tagged golfer so far this week and is the only golfer above $9K with single digit tags. In a week where there will be a ton of fresh faces to DFS golf due to the increase in contest sizes, Day makes for a fantastic GPP play.
1876	1876	19	19	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week. He has still finished no worse than 21st this season, after finishing 16th in Phoenix last week and he looks in perfect shape to compete at one of, if not his favourite stop.
7286	7286	13	14	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A number of shrewd punters are holding fancy positions on Southport's very own Tommy Fleetwood and after hitting a low of [22.0], he's drifted out to a much more appealing [28.0] for no reason at all. After his brilliance at the US Open, where he finished fourth, a respectable sixth in Germany just seven days later, victory in the Open de France and a very fair 10th in Ireland two weeks ago, Fleetwood is one of the hottest golfers in the field. It's hard to envisage Fleetwood not contending but I just wonder whether strong home expectations might pile on a bit too much pressure.
4240	4240	40	40	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Masters link might be worth exploring, though. Marsh Benson, formerly the senior course director at Augusta before retiring, was brought in as a consultant on this project and that, combined with those Augusta mentions, is enough to support Bill Haas at 40/1. Haas might be another who relishes the move away from Quail Hollow, even if he perhaps wouldn't admit it, because his record there had grown stale.
158	158	11	11	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steve Palmer - Racing Post - SBS Tournament of Champions 4ew Spieth 11/2, 3ew D Johnson 11/2 #SBSTournamentofChampions
3173	3173	66	66	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This New Zealander was so disappointed with how he played last year that he took a prolonged time away from the clubs and some encouraging signs lately suggest he isn't far away from validating that decision. Last week's performance in Puerto Rico was a little disappointing in some respects, given that he'd put together successive top-25 finishes in much deeper fields previously, but it looks like Lee just didn't get anything going on the greens and it's easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. On his last start in this event, Lee missed the cut but a second-round 66 contained eight birdies and just one mistake, a costly double-bogey.

11205	11205	30	30	target: Garcia's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago. The week before, he won the Singapore Open.
198	198	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having played well (T13 US PGA) on A.W. Tillinghast's Baltusrol, I'm taking Reed to really thrive on another of the great designer's east coast tracks. Snap up the 50/1.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
10448	10448	35	36	target: Brandon Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can reign in his putting to around field average, which he’s done in the past on these slower Bermuda greens, he’ll be a leaderboard fixture by the time the Super Bowl kicks off. Brandon Harkins  Need a sleeper? Hawkins fits the bill.
2608	2608	66	67	target: Paul Casey; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
13198	13198	9	9	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
417	417	42	43	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			South America: Emiliano Grillo – The Argentine is on a lovely run of form as he looks set to clinch the Rookie of the Year award on the PGA Tour. He finished in a tie for second last week, just one behind Patrick Reed, and also tied for 13th and 8th at the USPGA and Olympics. He’s up to sixth in the FedEx Cup and up to a career-high 25th in the world.
11347	11347	20	21	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It certainly helped that he got some favorable ruling in terms of finding sprinkler heads in the middle of nowhere. Tony Finau  He ranks just 112th in strokes gained putting but I think that's a bit misleading. Since switching his putting grip back at the Playoffs last year, he has gained strokes putting in 6-of-8 events with ShotLink.
517	517	22	22	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FRO - Jeremy Chapman - Houston Open - 1.5pt ew Henley 40-1, Stenson 14-1; 1ew Mickelson 22-1, 0.5pt ew Westwood 100-1, K Bradley 70-1
7177	7177	7	7	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
13674	13674	49	49	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After missing out on a chance to take the top spot in the Official World Ranking from Dustin Johnson last week, we're thinking he gets it done (a missed cut might even do the trick depending on what DJ does) this time. According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds.
6817	6817	31	32	target: Bud Cauley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
1475	1475	38	39	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Zach Johnson ($10.2m); 2: Phil Mickelson ($10.8m); 3: Brendan Steele ($9.3m); 4: Jason Dufner ($9.2m); 5: Charles Howell III ($9.9m); 6: Kevin Na ($8.8m); 7: Bill Haas ($10.5m); 8: Webb Simpson ($8.2m); 9: Ryan Palmer ($8.0m); 10: Charley Hoffman ($8.5m). Predictor Positives: Bill Haas is sure to haul the points in this week at an event which is his most productive on the PGA Tour schedule. Mr Consistency is the lowest-risk call across the $10m+ players this week and is sure to be in the mix at PGA West, coming off a strong putting performance at Waialae.
324	324	33	33	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statswise he ranks first in both SGTTG and SG approaches to the green, 16th in GIR and 14th in par 4 scoring. After a great performance last week and a good record here, Scott could be one to watch here this week. Brandt Snedeker 50/1  Ive decided to give Sneds another shot here at TPC Boston this week.
6070	6070	2	2	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2015, Casey gained a massive 10 strokes to the field with the strength of his approach game, and that’s a repeatable skill that should help him this week. Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens. Unlike Spieth, Casey has actually found some success off the tee – albeit not to the point where he’s a top-10 player, but he’s been consistent enough not to lose strokes in that area.
309	309	27	27	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
1623	1623	17	17	target: Tommy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 adds just now over at sportsbook: Knox 50 Ollie 60 Kizzire 60 They join from yesterday: Tommy 30, Harman 35, Billy Ho 100
9312	9312	60	61	target: Dustin Johnson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			doesn’t have a huge correlation at this course, but it does have a strong correlation to making birdies. The Golfers  Justin Thomas ($11100): This may be a good spot to get the reigning champion at lower-than-expected ownership (relative to the size of the field), with JT priced at the top of the field ahead of past winners Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson; Thomas won last year as he went nuclear to kick off his 2017, and he should be able to keep that up this week. Thomas was the best golfer from 50-125 yards out last year (15’6” from the cup on average) and was the sixth-best golfer in SG: Approach.
6184	6184	70	70	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s failed to finish better than T30 since The Masters and keeps falling victim to blow up rounds (80 at US Open, 78 at Memorial, 76 at the PLAYERS, 82 at Valero). Still, he plays the shorter courses well, and he’s only one of eight players in the field to have teed off in both Web events at this venue (T47: 2013; T25: 2012)… Lee is basically the opposite of Hadwin. He was brutal when the calendar flipped, but has been spitting HOT FIYA for just over a month now.
10188	10188	20	20	target: (Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course suits his monster hitting (currently second in Driving Distance), it's a coastal track where it can really blow (Finau won his only Tour title by the sea at the windy Puerto Rico Open and has played well in his two Open Championship starts) and it features Poa Annua greens. Finau is ranked 12th on the Future of Fantasy's list of top performers on Poa since 2013/14. In theory he should flourish, but what about the reality?
2527	2527	56	57	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rafa Cabrera-Bello is another frequent contender on the European Tour’s tighter courses and he's a factor here at 100/1, but again that’s a price which says his consistency should be considered a more valuable asset than Willett’s class and with four rounds for everyone, I’m not sure that’s the case. Instead, I like the look of Tommy Fleetwood at twice the price. The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East.
552	552	21	21	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Houston - 2ew Reed 45/1, 2ew Finau 45/1, Henley 2ew 35/1; 1ew Hoffman 55/1; 0.5ew List 100/1
2239	2239	40	41	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about: he's got two top-sixes and two more top-20s to start the year; he's made five straight cuts at Riviera; he's from Southern California and knows kikuyu; and he's fifth in scrambling, 13th in GIR and T26 in proximity. J.B. Holmes - $7,100 (40-1)    The oddsmakers don't consider DFS pricing before acting, but Holmes' price certainly doesn't jibe with his odds, and in a good way. He has had great success at Riviera, with six top-12s through the years, including T11 last year.
3485	3485	46	46	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am more than happy to overlook the finish last week, purely because I see last week as a tune-up for Phil, rather than him going for the win. Despite not having a single win since his Scottish Open/Open Championship double back in 2013, I think Mickelson still has plenty left in the tank. His efforts at the 2016 Open Championship, where he went toe-to-toe with Henrik Stenson on the final day, enough evidence for me.
8925	8925	51	51	target: Uihlein’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former top-ranked amateur golfer in the world decided to make the move back home this year, however, and did it in style by winning the first Web.com playoff event (about a month ago) and securing his PGA card for this season. While his putter can get red hot at times, Uihlein’s strength is generally his distance off the tee and ball-striking, which, profile-wise, fits him well with the past few winners of this event (Branden Steele, Emiliano Grillo). Given the fact Silverado’s setup has made it one of the easier courses on tour, I also like Uihlein a lot as a DraftKings play given he was always one of the most frequent birdie-makers in Europe and was 12th in Scoring Average there last season.
5966	5966	25	26	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But enough rambling; here's what the Professor has to say for the 2017 Travelers Championship. Pinterest Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth Jason Day Rory McIlroy Brandt Snedeker Justin Thomas Tony Finau Patrick Reed Webb Simpson Paul Casey Kevin Na  Professor's Explanation : The top three picks come out strong (in the event) almost every time. Their “long term” stats are so good, they get strong results on almost any course.
3971	3971	39	39	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm putting more faith in his talent (currently world number 24), recent momentum and ability to win in all parts of the world and in different conditions (Japan 2016, Phoenix, USA 2015, Turkey 2014, Scotland 2013, Spain 2012). Ryan Moore and Adam Hadwin were others who caught my eye. Moore had an excellent Masters until falling away on Sunday to finish T9.
7935	7935	47	47	target: Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His long approach statistics from both 175-200 (29’4”) and outside 200 (48’10”) would put him eighth and 41st in those respective categories were he qualified, and his overall strokes gained on approach of 0.908 would slot him just in front of Dustin Johnson in third place. Although Pieters struggles a little with his accuracy off the tee, he still finds the green 65.91% of the time (a 9% increase from DA% to GIR%), and once he’s on the greens he’s been lights out. He’ll need to improve on his par-4 scoring to have a chance to walk away with the Wanamaker Trophy, but with the length of these holes and the risk/reward of the two driveable holes, Pieters has an excellent shot this week.
4007	4007	16	16	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can spray it off the tee so we will hope that his driver is on. Finau checks so many boxes this week that moves him into our core play for the first time. He comes in at 12th in SG: Tee to Green, 15th in Par 4 Scoring, 26th in Bogey Avoidance, and 28th in Birdie or Better %.
7443	7443	1	1	target: Hagy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brendan Hagy ($6900): Although not a perfect fit, at $6900 Hagy has a lot to offer in terms of upside – especially when it comes to DraftKings scoring. Hagy is a par-5 animal (22nd in P5BoB%), and has the third most eagles on Tour (10) in only 57 measured rounds; Hagy typically scores by being the longest driver out there, currently averaging 313 yards off the tee. Although it’s not an impact stat in relation to finish position, distance has a very strong relationship to birdie-making, which will be important on an easy course.
12209	12209	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood - $15,900    Fleetwood could’ve cruised away with a victory during his API debut last year if it weren’t for a first-round 78, as he played his final three rounds in a combined 12-under-par to salvage a top-10 finish while champion Marc Leishman won with an overall score of 11-under. Fleetwood has finished T14 or better in six of his last seven starts, while he’s also second on Tour in SG: T2G. The Englishman has yet to win on American soil, but this could be the week Fleetwood proves himself worthy of a top-10 spot in the OWGR.
381	381	22	23	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I also believe he will once again come in much lower owned than Day and Johnson making him an elite GPP play. Adam Scott  Vegas Odds - 21/1  Draftkings - $10,400  FantasyAces - $5,750  He continued his impressive season this past week at the Barclay's with a T4, his 6th Top 10 of the year. He doesn't seem to get mentioned as much as the five players ahead of him and this could be to our benefit this week.
3875	3875	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open  Defending Champ: Charley Hoffman  FNTSY Sports Network’s Pat Mayo and Cam Stewart debate their Valero Texas Open picks and the week in betting at this week’s PGA Tour stop at TPC San Antonio. Valero Texas Open Field  156 Players | Top 70 and Ties Make the Cut  Congrats to WES-LEY Bryan, merely a trick shot aficionado NO MORE, he’s now a PGA winner. Plus, he looks pretty sharp in tartan, I must say.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
4133	4133	25	26	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele will likely be the highest owned golfer on the slate, but I am willing to put him in 60%-70% of my lineups this week. Tony Finau – $8,400  It’s a bombers week, so Tony Finau has to be considered especially at his reasonable $8,400 price tag. Finau has been playing solid this season with two top 5s in his last seven events.
13264	13264	12	12	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully he’s not too burned out from playing the weekend at Augusta. Webb Simpson  Webb has contended in this event (seven straight cuts made) for years, and that’s when he couldn’t putt. Still excellent with his irons, Simpson sits second in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting over his past 24 rounds.
5778	5778	31	32	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory McIlroy (8): Starts in the opposite wave as DJ, and there is no concerns with wasting starts since Rory has been sidelined for so long. =SUPER SUBS =  Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott      Group B    Jordan Spieth (3): Has won a U.S. Open already and has some experience at Erin Hills (2011 U.S. Amateur).
5471	5471	7	7	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Or almost anything but a golf movie. Fowler is a great feel-good pick. I can't top that one.
3269	3269	7	7	target: Taylor's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He even won an event last year. Taylor's forte has always been putting and he's a former runner-up of this event, back in 2010. In a further signal that this is his sort of test, Taylor also contended for 54 holes in the 2007 Masters en route to an excellent top-ten finish.
13195	13195	0	1	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
194	194	2	2	target: @BHaasGolf 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @BHaasGolf at 22/1 in the #careerbuilderchallenge. Hard to knock the strong claims of the two-time tournament winner Haas
5535	5535	47	47	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 37th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee which is vital this week, but more impressive is how he ranks in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green (9th), Stroked Gained: Tee-to-Green (9th) and Stroked Gained: Putting (23rd). Add to this his ranking of 38th in Stroked Gained: Around-the-Green and Kisner ranks an impressive 5th in Strokes Gained: Total. Kisner also ranks 12th in Driving Accuracy, but ranking just 132nd in Driving Distance (286.4 yards) meant his Total Driving ranking couldn’t be any better than 32nd.
6580	6580	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls. People are moving off of Reed at a point in the season he is playing his best golf.
2481	2481	5	6	target: Emiliano Grillo– 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			SEMI-FLIER (Last week: Molinari t-14th)    Emiliano Grillo– We might think of the 24-year-old Argentinian as streaky, but he’s only missed one cut on the PGA Tour since the PLAYERS Championship last May and has racked up a solid 10 top 25s in the process. Add in that he plays well on bentgrass/poa greens (the greens are a blend of the two grasses this week) and I’m loving me some Grillo esta semana. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Schwartzel MC)    Martin Kaymer– As mentioned above, I’ve been rip roarin’ hot lately with my BUST picks, nailing 4 popular players in a row to miss the cut (and 5 out of the last 6).
1637	1637	45	46	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 5 winners  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top ten performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016). The other three either hadn’t played for at least 3 weeks or finished outside the top 50 the week prior.
10586	10586	10	10	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hawkins fits the bill. Playing for the third consecutive week, Harkins has reeled off three straight top 25s with a T12 and T8 the past two weeks, and he’s been doing it scoring on par 5s and long par 4s. Over the past 12 rounds, he sits 11th and third respectively.
1624	1624	19	19	target: Lowry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A player capable of playing in bad conditions is always good to have on side and with Snedeker and Lowry we have two. What also appeals about Lowry is his course history. He’s played here on two occasions, finishing 7th on debut in 2015 and 13th here last year.
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
6531	6531	35	35	target: Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (DK: $7,800, FD: $8,100)    Walker is a guy that I like to target anytime where approach shots will be at a premium. He sometimes sprays if off of the tee, but similar to Holmes, the wide fairways should help mask some of those problems. Walker has been struggling will illness this year and is coming off of two straight missed cuts, but he is a good enough long-term golfer where you have to believe a rebound is coming.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2044	2044	32	32	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He sprays it off the tee without much distance, and the best part of his game is his scrambling and putting. Webb Simpson ($8,200)  Simpson is perhaps a perfect pivot off of Reed at this price because statistically he’s exactly what you’re looking for here. His approach game- especially out of the rough- is top tier and his entire tee to green game is solid.
10240	10240	37	37	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm spent 60 weeks as World Amateur Number 1 and just a look at his amateur history shows back-to-back wins plus victories in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah. Asked last week about his love for California, Rahm answered, "The main reason why I don't live in San Diego or in California is taxes, to be honest. I love Phoenix, but San Diego is probably my favourite spot in the world.
1247	1247	1	1	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
7324	7324	18	19	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens. The only score close is Mark O'Meara's even-par in 1998, also weather-induced.
5228	5228	20	21	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week. Adam Hadwin – $7,600  Adam Hadwin was heavily owned last week, and even though he didn’t miss the cut, he certainly didn’t win anyone money. Hadwin only has six tags on FanShareSports, clearly showing people have already moved on.
11	11	4	4	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
4644	4644	7	8	target: Zac Blair, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards). Again like Blair, John Huh is also very accurate off the tee, and this is a course where a lack of distance won’t hurt and it’s a key to put the ball at the right yardage. He doesn’t make as many birdies as one would like for DK scoring, but on a course where there aren’t that many birdies to go around, he’s a fine play – he also checks off the Par-4 Scoring box, with an average of 3.99 (22nd).
6390	6390	8	9	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Greenbrier  1. Patrick Reed  2. Bill Haas  3.
12606	12606	21	21	target: Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Coming off the missed cut at the API mixed with less than stellar course history could lead to lower ownership. Nick Watney $6,800 – I think this price is about $500 too low, so I will take advantage of the savings. Tom Lovelady $7,400 – Never played here but has finished top 20 in 2 of his last 3 starts.
12859	12859	35	35	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Putting during a single event is the least predictable thing in golf, so if Spieth can roll around field average, or slightly better, Jim Nantz again will be congratulating Jordan on a Masters victory. Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that.
9143	9143	0	0	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton has undoubtedly struggled with his game throughout 2017, but green shoots have been visible of late. A dangerous scorer, Kizzire hit the PGA Tour in 2015/16 with a bang. 2 wins and a further 10 top-10s on the 2015 web.com Tour marked him out as a talent of high regard.
6360	6360	13	14	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Rickie Fowler – $12,000  The top of the board this week is extremely thin. I will sprinkle ownership on all three golfers, but if I had to pick one to build a cash team with or go overweight on, it’s Rickie Fowler.
236	236	19	19	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He loves the challenge of a difficult golf course and I could easily see him taking home this title. Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 33/1  Draftkings - $9,100  FantasyAces - $5,650  Bubba checks every box for me this week. He is coming off an 8th place finish at the Olympics and if there was anyone who seemed to embrace the experience 100% it was definitely Bubba.
8668	8668	65	65	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A two-time winner of that event, he will be as keen as ever to get back to East Lake and could yet win the FedEx Cup which, along with that elusive US Open title, is among the few things missing from his packed trophy cabinet. Combine motivation with a return to form last time and unsurprisingly strong birdie figures, and the 66/1 quoted generally about Mickelson makes plenty of appeal. It's a young man's game these days, but this 47-year-old is relishing the challenge of fending off another set of young superstars.
1065	1065	13	13	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
257	257	3	3	target: Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Casey, An &amp; Molinari in Genesis Open this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
2283	2283	14	15	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he will be chalk, don’t get cute and fade DJ in cash. Paul Casey – $8,600  Paul Casey ended the 2016 season with some of his best golf of his career. He went through the FedEx cup playoffs pounding out top 5 results.
13639	13639	32	33	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Henrik Stenson, Zach Johnson, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
9732	9732	16	17	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At just 7,044 yards, the short course has two very reachable par-5s and many score-friendly holes. Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, and four others from the world’s top 30 headline a field that should make plenty of birdies and provide plenty of riveting golf action in paradise. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Justin Thomas  2016 – Fabian Gomez  2015 – Jimmy Walker  2014 – Jimmy Walker  2013 – Russell Henley  2012 – Johnson Wagner  2011 – Mark Wilson  2010 – Ryan Palmer  2009 – Zach Johnson  2008 – K.J.
1707	1707	31	31	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Any other year he would have won the Open Championship with his performance at Royal Troon, but Henrik Stenson was just too good. In addition to his 2nd place that week, Mickelson also finished runner-up at Pebble Beach and the FedEx St Jude Classic. Three further top-4 finishes at the CareerBuilder, WGC Cadillac and the Wells Fargo were enough to ensure a very solid year.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
421	421	11	11	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bets out early this week! Arnold Palmer Bets: Outright: Rose E/W: Kisner McDowell Perez FRL: Saunders
853	853	16	16	target: Rory/Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just getting around to listen. Looks like @NYCPunter and I are both gonna be riding the Rory/Hideki train... https://t.co/drnZAVEJBz
3035	3035	35	35	target: DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,200) - Uihlein, at the same price, also deserves some attention. He grades out worse in the world rankings (174th) than Zanotti but is the 4th-most expensive option on DraftKings, and only Bryan, DeLaet, and McDowell have better odds to win outright than Uihlein's 25/1 mark. He's also 4/1 to net a top-five finish despite two missed cuts here in his past three events.
1006	1006	5	6	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whee Kim - $7,400  5. Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
8237	8237	26	26	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has twice been inside the top five of the Open including at Hoylake in 2014 – a course which is a short distance from Birkdale. Fowler is third for strokes gained putting this season and first for scoring average on the PGA Tour. This looks another huge opportunity for Fowler to join the growing list of first-time major champions and should be backed even though generous odds of 33/1 are long gone.
2495	2495	38	38	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In other words, right now he has the game to play well anywhere and that makes him such an appealing proposition on a course unknown to virtually everyone this week. Speaking about the current state of his game, Woodland said at the end of the Honda Classic: "I'm happy with the way I'm playing, and looking forward to playing the next couple weeks in a row." That's here and next week's PGA Tour event at Innisbrook.
10938	10938	0	1	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months. Rory McIlroy, $11700 – Rory has only played once at Riviera (T20 back in 2016), but his incredibly ability to drive the ball and hit solid irons should net him plenty of birdie potential on Riviera.
9551	9551	11	11	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's played Kapalua once before, tying for 23rd in 2013. Brian Harman - $8,700 (30-1)    You want to play elite putters this week and Harman is one of the best. He's third in strokes gained putting so far this season and was fifth last season.
571	571	2	2	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar went to Georgia Tech and he plays pretty well in this college hometown event. However, his form has slipped in the playoffs.
13112	13112	40	41	target: Si Woo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time. The thing that makes these two finishes of particular interest to me is that when Si Woo has won his two PGA tour titles to date he hasn’t come in to the events on a blinding run of form, but has actually won events following steady 25th & 22nd place finishes. So in summary we have a world class proven winner, on a perfect track for his game rounding in to steady form.
732	732	3	3	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			OAD will be Grace or Steele im still undecided
1315	1315	2	3	target: Harris English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Oh god Harris English was T8 and T11 the last two weeks and has two top 10's in Scottsdale. https://t.co/Lhekanxodh
13196	13196	22	22	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again though, this isn’t a course you’d expect him to compete at, and his form at other events is far more intriguing. Cook won the RSM Classic, finished T18 at the Sony Open and also made the weekend at the Mayakoba (T50) after shooting an opening-round 66. All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game.
6301	6301	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also, look for me on Twitter (@DFSBenj), where I'll be providing much more PGA and MLB daily fantasy content. Key Stats:  Strokes Gained Approach  Scrambling  Ball Striking  Par 4 Scoring  Driving Accuracy  Quicken Loans National Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Patrick Reed (DK: $11,100, FD: $9,800)  I expect most will go with Rickie Fowler in this spot, but for GPPs I’m leaning toward Reed. He has been trending up for the past month or so, and it feels like a win is coming for him.
7495	7495	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
3596	3596	31	31	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years. He will look to dominate the competition with his strong iron play.
168	168	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To steal a line from Samuel L. Jackson in the first Jurassic Park, "Hold on to your butts." Jonathan Coachman -- Jason Day ($12,400)  Bethpage Black is a "big boys" golf course. There are a lot of holes that have long carries and long approach shots.
7624	7624	54	55	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This isn’t incredibly groundbreaking information, but you’ll want to roster golfers who can take advantage of the short Par 5s and who are in good recent form in terms of accuracy. The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively.
12088	12088	26	26	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Well, you can point directly to his short game. Despite gaining an average of just under three strokes with his approaches over his past three events, Fowler has forgotten how to chip and putt. He has lost almost nine full strokes with his putter in his last two starts.
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods – $10,000  Personal note – I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.
763	763	21	21	target: Louis 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I dont care if Webb swam in the hazards at Eagle Point as a boy, not betting him at 40-1 when Louis is same or better
5457	5457	76	77	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Welcome to the 60th edition of the FedEx St. Jude Classic, otherwise known as either a U.S. Open tune-up or a last-gasp effort to make it into the U.S. Open field. A weak-field event, the FESJ includes six of the top 30 golfers in the current FedEx Cup standings and eight of the top 30 in the Official World Golf Ranking: Rickie Fowler (9), Adam Scott (12), Francesco Molinari (16), Charl Schwartzel (21), Brooks Koepka (22), Phil Mickelson (23), Kevin Chappell (26) and Rafa Cabrera-Bello (30). Players face a stern test this week ahead of their U.S. Open final exam (should they be lucky enough to sit for it).
8446	8446	39	39	target: Jason 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			27th at the Open Championship, 24th at the Bridgestone Invitational and 9th at the PGA Championship - a position which would have been closer to a tie for 5th without his ill-judged 'snowman' on the 18th on Saturday - Jason is undoubtedly warming to the cause. Day thrives in the north-east of America as 5th at Ridgewood (2010), 2nd at TPC Boston (2010), 3rd at TPC Boston (2011), 8th at Oak Hill (2013), 2nd at Ridgewood (2014), 7th at TPC Boston (2014), 1st at Plainfield (2015), 2nd at Baltusrol (2016) and 4th at Bethpage Black (2016) when defending his Barclays title 12 months ago ably highlights. But there are a couple of other reasons why I like the World Number 9 this week.
3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
2706	2706	0	1	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
1587	1587	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (DK $9,400) was the chalk trap at Sony and you can bet he’ll be low owned after burning a bunch of your opponents money. Walker’s success here is weird considering how difficult it is to hit fairways, but I’m not going to argue with results and getting him at a lower ownership this week will be a perk. Fire up West Coast Jimmy.
3907	3907	27	27	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him. Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75.
1865	1865	12	12	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back. Jones played in his first event of 2017 last week in Phoenix, saving his best round until last. A final-round 66 saw Jones climb the leaderboard, finishing T36.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
2065	2065	12	12	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So he already checks the recent form and course history boxes. Although Rose didn't excel at shots between 50-125 yards last season, he did excel at approaches 200-225 yards, which will be highly important on the Par 5s across these three courses. The 2016 Olympic Champion is proving his back is a non-issue and that he is a top 10 golfer in the world once again.
9725	9725	3	3	target: Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
2127	2127	47	48	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Tommy Fleetwood; 2) C.T. Pan / Kevin Streelman; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Daniel Berger; 6) Martin Kaymer / Francesco Molinari; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Charl Schwartzel; 10) Keegan Bradley; 11) Patrick Cantlay / Peter Uihlein; 13) Billy Horschel; 14) Branden Grace; 15) Dustin Johnson / Pat Perez / J.J. Spaun; 18) Brendan Steele; 19) Kyle Stanley; 20) Justin Thomas. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Justin Thomas; 3) Daniel Berger; 4) Matt Kuchar / Phil Mickelson; 6) James Hahn; 7) Padraig Harrington; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Chris Stroud; 10) Brian Gay; 11) Tommy Fleetwood; 12) Cameron Smith; 13) Alex Noren; 14) Dominic Bozzelli / Si Woo Kim; 16) Retief Goosen; 17) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Peter Malnati; 19) Wesley Bryan / J.B. Holmes.
11199	11199	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Saunders is ranked 33rd on Tour in strokes gained total. Luke Donald - $7,000 (150-1)  There aren't many tracks to take Donald anymore. This is one of them.
13418	13418	10	10	target: Landry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the many tempting options at three-figure prices, it's Andrew Landry who stands out. Born in Texas, Landry won a couple of minor tour events in his home state before turning professional and hinting that difficult conditions may bring out his best when scoring a five-shot victory in 11-under-par on the Web.com Tour. Almost two years later, he won by three in 16-under and in-between those efforts, he shot to fame by contending for the US Open at Oakmont before falling to a more than respectable share of 15th having made his way through sectional qualifying.
11176	11176	1	1	target: Hatton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton, $10600 – A European Tour staple, Hatton will make his first PGA Tour start this season at the course he finished fourth at last year. Hatton is a great putter who recently finished third at the Dubai Desert Classic, making him worth strong consideration this week. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Russell Knox, $9400 – Knox has proven his worth at PGA National, netting a pair of top-3 finishes in 2014 & 2015, respectively.
1255	1255	4	4	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that. He was eighth on tour in scrambling last season.
11154	11154	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton 25/1  The Englishman has been in super form recently and hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in his last six starts. Since winning the Alfred Dunhill Links and Italian Open back to back in October, Hatton followed that with an impressive T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China. He then travelled to Turkey finishing T16 at the Turkish Airlines Open followed by a T19 at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa.
11971	11971	9	9	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this point, you are purely betting on whether Scott can putt even just respectably for four rounds, which at 40/1 I am happy to chance that he will. When 3rd here in 2014, Scott ranked 14th in SG: Putting, and that will be the sort of ranking he will need to achieve this week. Zach Johnson 66/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Zach Johnson has quietly been playing very solidly in 2018 and he looks to be returning to something close to winning form.
12672	12672	28	29	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
5799	5799	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he has even a mediocre week with his new putter, expect him to be in contention on the back nine Sunday. -- Kevin Maguire  Dustin Johnson  Until someone proves otherwise, Johnson, when healthy, will have a run of being in top-five contention at majors. Erin Hills is long and a perfect setup for his game.
8431	8431	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth. 1 - Jonas Blixt, Keegan Bradley, Jason Dufner, Emiliano Grillo, Bill Haas, James Hahn, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Hideki Matsuyama, William McGirt, Geoff Ogilvy, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Scott Stallings, Brendan Steele, Henrik Stenson, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland.
10176	10176	54	54	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprise, surprise, he missed the cut at Torrey in both 2013 and 2014 as his game dipped in general but, after making it to the weekend in 2015, he improved to T25 in 2016 and jumped again to T14 last year. In the table of biggest Net gain in world rankings points for 2017, Stanley placed 11th after making a massive surge from 258th at the start of the year to 48th at the end. He's now up to 45th.
3599	3599	28	29	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
7895	7895	44	44	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed has improved his year-end ranking each and every year he's been a pro, but he's going to need a very special end to 2017 if he's to better last year's final ranking of eighth (he's currently dropped to 25th). Despite the rankings drop, Reed is insistent he's currently playing better than last season - he's been in the top 25 in eight of his last 11 events; he was fourth on his Bridgestone debut in 2014, and 15th the year after. I'd certainly back him to be higher than 25th in the world when 2018 rolls around.
6028	6028	14	14	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, many other studs missed the cut as well. Oh what could’ve been if Casey and Fowler didn’t falter on the weekend. On to the Travelers Championship.
2433	2433	11	12	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 on Tour in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season truly dangerous. Sergio Garcia ($10,900) – What’s not to like about this choice? He’s been playing well recently (a win in Dubai three weeks ago featured four rounds in the 60s).
9734	9734	56	57	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi    Key Stats to Winning at Waialae CC    • Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green  • Greens in Regulation percentage  • Putting inside 10 feet  • Par Breakers    Champion’s Profile    Traditionally, driving accuracy has been crucial for success, but dry weather changes the profile for a second straight year. Last year’s dry spell resulted in sparse rough, which allowed Justin Thomas to run away with victory despite finishing 66th in driving accuracy (he was 1st in SG: Tee-to-Green). Given the similar conditions a year later, players – much like last year – can get away with missing more fairways so long as they are in position to hit the green in regulation.
1921	1921	27	28	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry $7,000 – Very low price, Oostyesque if you know what I’m saying. C-List  Cameron Smith $6,900  Jim Herman $6,900  Ryan Brehm $6,700  Steve Stricker $6,600  Robert Garrigus $6,600  That is all for this week. Per the usual hit me up on twitter if you have questions or need help.
325	325	6	6	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico #bets Knox (CIMB correl) 80 Moore (CIMB) 100 3 amigos - Sergio 25, Rahm 30, Rafa 80 Hend (OEM, CIMB) Top 10
6717	6717	83	83	target: Harman; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Charles Howell III; 2) J.J. Henry; 3) Ryan Armour / Ben Martin / Kyle Stanley; 6) Chad Campbell / Trey Mullinax; 8) Danny Lee; 9) Bud Cauley; 10) Steve Stricker / Nick Taylor; 12) Daniel Berger / Joel Dahmen / Charley Hoffman / Scott Stallings; 16) Luke List / Sean O'Hair / Daniel Summerhays; 19) Hunter Mahan / Nick Watney; 21) Spencer Levin. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Billy Hurley III; 2) Willy Wilcox; 3) Brian Harman; 4) Danny Lee; 5) Tag Ridings; 6) Grayson Murray; 7) Chez Reavie / Steve Stricker; 9) Daniel Berger / Wesley Bryan / Morgan Hoffmann / Jamie Lovemark; 13) Ryan Blaum / Ben Martin; 15) Charles Howell III / Smylie Kaufman; 17) Charley Hoffman / Kyle Stanley; 19) Zach Johnson; 20) Vaughn Taylor / Kevin Tway. Winners & Prices : 2016: Moore 25/1 ; 2015: Spieth 4/1 ; 2014: Harman 125/1 ; 2013: Spieth 40/1 ; 2012: Zach Johnson 12/1 ; 2011: Stricker 7/1 ; 2010: Stricker 16/1 .
8802	8802	10	10	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest. So much is about momentum at this time of year and while plenty of the field are going the wrong way, the Englishman is coming on strong.
9633	9633	38	39	target: Kevin Kisner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Those who've shown if not here then at places like Harbour Town, Southwind, Colonial and Copperhead, that a low-scoring test of precision is their bag; that hard-to-hit fairways offer an opportunity, rather than a problem. Someone, perhaps, like Kevin Kisner. With the front two in the betting there to be taken on, suddenly this feels like an eminently winnable event.
6749	6749	37	37	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rounds of 68-68-62 (a career low) got the Texas-based 26-year-old into the Final Group with Spieth and going down the last Danny and Jordan were level with the clubhouse leader Tom Gillis. However an untimely bogey saw Lee miss out by a single shot on a play-off that Spieth rather predictably won. Fact is though, Deere Run suits the New Zealander down to a tee and we know that he's one to follow when he's in form and conditions are receptive.
4658	4658	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I guess it is suitable for Finau as he has finished 10th and 12th in his only attempts at this course. Finau ranks 4th in GIR%, 6th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 17th in BoB%. I will only be using Finau in GPPs as he is volatile in nature and can finish T10 or miss cut.
343	343	12	12	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not so sure that will be the case at the Deutsche. Spieth is all too aware that his driver needs to be straightened, "But for me, right now it comes down to driving the ball. I found some fairways towards the end but I need to kind of try and figure out a ball flight I know I can play on each hole, whether it's a draw or a fade" - he went on to split 8 of 14 on Sunday.
7388	7388	20	21	target: Matt Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
6178	6178	34	35	target: Rory McIlroy: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ultimately, we're looking at another second-shot golf course this week with greens in regulation percentage, proximity to the hole, and iron play from 150 to 200 yards key this week. Creme de la Creme  Rory McIlroy: $11,600  If Rory McIlroy doesn't barnstorm his way around this course and make one million birdies, he's not Rory McIlroy. Seriously.
10175	10175	25	25	target: Stanley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He lost his card at the end of 2014, struggled horribly with the putter and looked as if he might have had his moment. But Stanley, still only 30, bounced back last year with a bang and posted his second PGA Tour win by landing the 2017 Quicken Loans National. His winning total of 7-under showed he liked a tough test where his ball-striking could come to the fore and that's what makes him a good fit at Torrey Pines.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
12007	12007	13	14	target: Justin Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill.
8768	8768	5	6	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley. Winners & Prices : 2016: McIlroy 13/2 ; 2015: Spieth 9/1 ; 2014: Horschel 25/1 ; 2013: Stenson 16/1 ; 2012: Snedeker 40/1 ; 2011: Haas 45/1 ; 2010: Furyk 20/1 ; Average: 23/1.
1672	1672	10	10	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 3ew Thomas 12-1; 1ew Kisner 60-1, Kaymer 70-1 #HondaClassic
537	537	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke. Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13
4634	4634	106	107	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
703	703	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			made two bets for the Valero so far Palmer 50 to 1 Reed 35 to 1 Holding pattern for tee times / weather
760	760	13	13	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings selections  As ever the three players above will be plugged in lineups. Walker is by far the most expensive of the three at $9,600, whilst Martin and Watney are available at a more modest $7,600 and $7,500 respectively. Plugging these three players in your lineup leaves you with an AVG Salary of $8,433 for three more players.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
12535	12535	32	32	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Holmes proved that in his win in 2015, which is the highlight of his history here that also includes a runner-up, T8, T12, and T42. Beyond his 4th-place finish at Torrey Pines, Holmes has had an average year on Tour so far: two missed cuts in seven events, and his best finish away from Torrey was a T41 at Bay Hill. Statistically, Holmes looks about the same as he always does, which means strong off the tee, bad on the greens, and mediocre on approach.
3068	3068	38	39	target: Bryson DeChambeau, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Ben Crane, Seamus Power  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Graeme McDowell, Peter Uihlein, Fabrizio Zanotti, Danny Lee, John Peterson, Michael Thompson, Thorbjorn Olesen, Harold Varner III, Andrew Johnston  – Brandon Hagy, JT Poston, Zac Blair, Bryson DeChambeau, Boo Weekley, Ben Crane, Seamus Power, Ryan Brehm  Bets:  Peter Uihlein 33-1  John Peterson 70-1  Harold Varner 80-1  Michael Thompson 100-1 While he comes in off the back of three missed cuts he’s a player who can find form fast and has two top twenties to his name already in 2017, and also won a web.com playoff event late in 2016. He’s played well at windy venues before (won the Honda Classic back in 2013) and has also made the cut at this event in all three appearances.
620	620	4	4	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Main targets Kisner +25 Fitzpatrick +28 Horschel +35 Knox +40 Bryan +60 Wasting $$$ on B.A.D. +40 Willett +66 Bello +66 Lee +100 CAM +125
4369	4369	11	11	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a lock in cash or GPP contests. Value Plays  Daniel Berger $8,300 – Here’s a nice nugget of info for you…Berger has the same Vegas odds to win this event as Webb Simpson. However, he’s $1,400 cheaper on DraftKings.
1397	1397	13	14	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 2: Jimmy Walker ($9.9m); 3: Brandt Snedeker ($9.7m); 4: Jason Dufner ($7.7m); 5: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 6: Justin Thomas ($10.5m); 7: Russell Henley ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($8.5m); 9: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.7m). Predictor Positives: Jordan Spieth dominates the Predictor model this week with a virtual 500 point gap to 'course horse' Jimmy Walker. Both Texans performed well enough at Kapalua with Spieth needing to take less risks to alleviate damaging dropped shots.
5615	5615	3	3	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But not before Johnson raises another U.S. Open trophy and lets the noise wash all the way over him. There are no trees on this property so that unforgettable noise will rise into the ether and disappear forever. And remember that harmonious barrel fire off of Johnson's clubs as he bends and unfurls his spindly frame into shot after shot at Erin Hills and winds his way around the old farmland.
130	130	2	3	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week. Safely qualified for the Ryder Cup team (as Kuchar was when winning this in 2010), Walker's results CV looks very similar to that of Nick Watney with a plethora of top finishes on the West Coast across Torrey Pines, Pebble Beach, CordeValle and Riviera, so we know he can perform well on putting surfaces with Poa Annua in them.
6034	6034	20	21	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, we head to TPC River Highlands for the Travelers Championship. This year’s field has a few headliners in Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, and Rory McIlroy, but is fairly weak after the top 20-25 players. Last year, the Travelers was held after the PGA Championship, but it’s been bumped up in the ever-changing schedule.
3993	3993	24	25	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Generally, TPC San Antonio is a putter's paradise and favors strong play inside 150 yards, as well as capable scrambling. Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012).
1432	1432	19	20	target: Jerry Kelly 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A mere glance at the form bank instantly reveals an outstanding value bet. How on earth was course specialist Jerry Kelly matched at [300.0] on the exchange? Winner in 2002, Kelly has made the top-20 on 11 of 17 renewals this century, including top-nines in the last three.
2270	2270	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele comes here in much better form than he did last year and looks great value to keep up his good run of form here. Keegan Bradley 80/1  I was quite surprised to see Keegan Bradley at such a big price this week considering the form he’s in. He finished 2016 with three top 15’s in four events finishing solo sixth at the CIMB Classic, T7 at The Shriners Open and a T15 at the OHL Classic.
8997	8997	3	3	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic. Thomas Pieters – GPP – DK: $8600 FD: $8000  One of my favourite plays when there is a no-cut event.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8200	8200	23	23	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He then travelled to Birkdale and didn’t shoot worse than a 71 to finish a respectable T22. Last week at the WGC Bridgestone, Fowler was steady as a rock throughout the week shooting 70,71,67,66 on his way to a solo ninth. He has a good record here in Quail Hollow getting his first PGA Tour win here in 2012.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
2705	2705	0	1	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
8869	8869	14	14	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bottom of the board is fairly ugly for this tight 30 man field. Thomas is one of five golfers who can win the FedEx Cup with a win this week at East Lake. Ignore his 47th last week at the BMW.
13683	13683	0	1	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
11226	11226	62	63	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Bob Harig  Daniel Berger  Neither form nor recent course history seems like it's on his side -- he MC'd in last week's Genesis Open and each of the last two editions of the Honda -- but he's played well so far this year and is back on home turf at an event where he once reached a playoff. -- Jason Sobel  Luke Donald  Donald has his spots on the PGA Tour, and this is one of them. The fact that he was able to make the cut last week and not finish last on a course that rewards strong off the tee play is a good thing.
6002	6002	9	9	target: Leishman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TRAVELERS CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE HISTORY : THE GOOD  1. Marc Leishman, $9,300  Leishman has played this event in each of the last five years, making the cut each time and never finishing worse than 39th. It’s a run which includes a win in 2012, an 11th in 2014 and a ninth last year.
1815	1815	4	5	target: Hideki Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
5674	5674	25	25	target: Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had three top-10s on the PGA Tour at the start of the year but his last eight starts have produced form figures reading MC-49-64-18-42-MC-MC-52. Knox, the 39th best player in the world according to official figures, isn't exactly setting the world alight either but his 67 in Memphis on Sunday, which saw him climb from 68th to 37th, was encouraging enough and he has the best US Open record too. In two starts, Knox has finished 45th and 23rd.
6883	6883	45	45	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore ranked first for GIR and nobody played the par fives better. Spieth managed to win here in 2013 when playing the long holes in just six-under-par but 12 of the last 13 winners have played them in at least eight-under-par for the week and Moore played them in nine-under-par. Is There an Angle In?
6996	6996	55	57	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's made the weekend in all eight appearances at Deere Run, with five top 25s and three top 10s, but treat him like a wild card. American Family Insurance Championship - Round One Michael Cohen  Expert Picks  Kyle Stanley  Charley Hoffman  Brian Harman  Danny Lee  Daniel Berger  Steve Stricker  Chad Campbell  Kevin Kisner  Johnson Wagner  Charles Howell III  Expert Explanation: For the Model to not pick Stricker is a travesty on par with Forrest Gump winning the Oscar over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. Not only does Stricker have seven top 10s in 15 tries, he's still getting it done at age 50, highlighted by a T-7 at Colonial and T-16 at the U.S. Open.
293	293	6	6	target: Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @ollie_gt at 74/1 in @TheHondaClassic. Schniederjans is a big talent and the American has caught the eye with 2 top tens in last 3
4157	4157	4	5	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year.
7522	7522	13	13	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts. Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week. With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week.
1413	1413	22	22	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sub $8million Salary Players :  Positive: Ryan Blaum and Charles Howell III deserve respect as highlighted and I cannot believe that Chris Kirk is available at ($7.7m). Kirk was top-priced $11.3m at the RSM Classic last time out for him and a missed cut there has seen his salary plummet by $3.6 million. That's a huge downshift and one that needs to exploited as Kirk is a TifDwarf Bermudagrass green specialist who otherwise finished 2016 brilliantly.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
4877	4877	25	26	target: Chris Kirk– 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This very well could be the year when he finds his way into the winner’s circle on this revered track. SEMI-FLIER (Last week: Finau t-13th)    Chris Kirk– Can’t say that I’m much of a Chris Kirk fan, but he’s shown that over the course of the past few years that when he starts to heat up, hop aboard. After a t-8th, t-2nd, t-7th stretch in 3 out of 4 events in the fall, he went into hibernation mode with his game missing cuts left and right, before jumping back into form with a t-12th at the PLAYERS two weeks ago.
10093	10093	3	3	target: Kizzire’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The win is Kizzire’s second win of the young 2017-18 golf season and it boosted his standing in the World Golf Rankings. Less than three months ago, Kizzire was ranked outside of the Top 300; he is now number 54 in the world. The Sony Open took place in Hawaii where a ballistic missile alert was sent out mistakenly Saturday morning.
10975	10975	19	20	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am looking for Pieters to draw on his good memories here and put his good form to use. Keegan Bradley ($7.6K) – Keegan Bradley seems to be returning to his Major-winning ways this year. He spent most of last year getting sorted with putting grips and changes.
2346	2346	28	29	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2017 Honda Classic betting odds have been released for the week at PGA National's Champion Course in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The betting favorite this week is Adam Scott, who played great in his 2017 PGA Tour debut at Riviera, going off with 12-to-1 betting odds to start the week. Next best is Sergio Garcia, who was disappointing at the Genesis Open, but he has 16-to-1 (+1600) betting odds to begin.
6900	6900	42	43	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One week after last year's Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III contended for three days at the Greenbrier, don't be surprised to see the current Presidents Cup captain get into the mix on a course where he's won before. -- Jason Sobel  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner has "only" won the John Deere Classic once, but since 2010 his average finish is between seventh and eighth place. The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
459	459	30	31	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
10622	10622	22	23	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a great venue for him to keep his hot play going and I'm happy to get involved at 35/1. Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price.
2597	2597	5	5	target: Spieth: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la creme  Jordan Spieth: $11,500  Here's the thought: The caddie-player pairing of Greller and Spieth > (Austin) Johnson and (Dustin) Johnson at a new track featuring an abundance of elevation-related calculations. A winner at Pebble Beach, Spieth is currently the tour leader in strokes gained: approach-the-green. DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish.
1423	1423	19	19	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take one of the best putters in the world at +2300 here. Not many guys are talking about Dufner this week. I’m plugging him into the majority of my Draft Kings teams as well as buying him at +5000 to win the Sony.
1131	1131	20	21	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With each-way terms of 1/5 1,2,3,4, the 11/2 is definitely playable. I also think this course could be perfect for Rickie Fowler. He certainly suggested it might be last year when solo third after shooting 15-under on the weekend.
7019	7019	8	8	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also, he has only played here once, but Kim was solid in his first time playing at TPC Deere Run, finishing T47th last season. If he can keep it going with how much better he has been hitting greens over the last two weeks, I think Kim should make the cut again this year and post a higher finish. He has top 25 upside in this field and is a fine value play in both cash games and GPPs at this low price of only $6,900.
1045	1045	21	21	target: Kirk's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
9995	9995	20	20	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I don’t know how it’s going to start out, but I’m very optimistic." Contrast that with a year ago, when Mickelson arrived here with close to zero expectations having had two surgeries since his last competitive outing. In fact, his first full round of golf in over three months came the Saturday before tournament week, so the only thing surprising about a performance which tapered off to 21st was that it started so well.
7881	7881	14	15	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vamos! EXPERT MIKE McALLISTER , Managing Editor LINEUP | BENCH Rickie Fowler  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Jordan Spieth  Branden Grace  Adam Scott  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth Dustin did it earlier this year. No reason why Spieth can’t win three straight.
13359	13359	21	22	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I really like his chances this week on a hard course where aggressive driving is rewarded in spades. RESULT: T11  Xander Schauffele 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street.
9207	9207	1	1	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gary Woodland – Cash Games – DK: $9400 FD: $9000  Woodland looked good last week finishing T18 and has shown solid form lately with six straight made cuts. Finishing 2nd here last season Woodland is sure to draw high ownership on both DraftKings and FanDuel given his salary. Chesson Hadley – FanDuel Value – DK: $9900 FD: $7400  Hadley’s price on FanDuel remains ridiculously low for another week.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
8880	8880	0	1	target: Brice Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20. His up and down play makes him an unnecessary risk in cash formats but I like his high ceiling for GPP formats.
669	669	4	5	target: L. List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: L. List - 60/1 J. Spaun - 66/1 N. Taylor - 150/1 M. Jones - 175/1 S. Power - 200/1 Top 20s to follow. Weak field!
11031	11031	40	41	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s always a danger he’ll hit a wall like Brian Harman and Chez Reavie have before him, but he’s simply playing too well to be overlooked, especially when you’re getting a discount because of the bigger names in the field. Martin Kaymer  The former world’s No. 1 has been middling with results for about two years now.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
5017	5017	15	15	target: Ikeda. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The other interesting golfer that shows up on the OWGR vs. Salary chart is Yuta Ikeda. I’ll be the first to raise my hand and admit I don’t really know this golfer at all, however a quick google search shows that Ikeda has a win on the Asian tour in every year between 2009 and 2016 racking up a total of sixteen wins internationally. Definitely take it with a grain of salt, and there are no guarantees here, but Ikeda shows up as a blip on the charts, and the charts don’t lie!
13372	13372	44	44	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In previous winners Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell, both of them had previous top 3 finishes here, so let's be straight - you don't have to re-invent the wheel to grab the winner here. Asked in 2016 what he thought of TPC San Antonio, Horschel said, "like I said, I've been in this contending position before here the last couple of years. I want to get the job done.
383	383	2	2	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valspar bets: Berger 35-1 Dufner 40-1 An 50-1 Simpson 60-1 Horschel 65-1 Watney 100-1 Ollie 110-1 Saunders 500-1
1689	1689	9	9	target: Rory, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
619	619	97	98	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the John Deere Classic / Scottish Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama.

1694	1694	24	24	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The talent is no doubt there, along with form (current and course) so at 40/1 he looks good value to do just that. Tony Finau 50/1 (Betfred) 1pt e/w:  Finau has been in great form of late, most notably his T4 finish last week at Torrey Pines. After a slow start to the season (T26, T33, T41, MC) Finau turned a corner at the Tournament of Champions finishing T9.
8820	8820	32	32	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
5436	5436	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week.
237	237	22	23	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At $9,100 he makes an excellent value play in any format. Also Consider - Hideki Matsuyama  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Patrick Reed  Vegas Odds - 50/1  Draftkings - $8,800  FantasyAces - $5,600    Don't get me wrong I love Sneds as well but with the amount he is being discussed I tend to find myself leaning on some other options in this range. Topping that list is Patrick Reed.
10732	10732	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
315	315	32	32	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are wide and can offer players the opportunity to be aggressive so be on the lookout for guys with good GIR, par 4 scoring and strokes gained putting stats. Jason Day 13/2  With five birdies in the first six holes of his second round Day looked in complete control. He then unfortunately undone all that good work by going bogey-double-bogey on 8,9 and 10.
6345	6345	3	3	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A combination of Lee scrambling better recently and simply hitting more greens has led to five straight made cuts and three finishes inside the top six in that span. In our VIP Spreadsheet, we can see Danny Lee is third in the entire field in field adjusted Greens in Regulation. As a guy who traditionally performs better to the field on par threes and fours then par fives I like Lee a lot this week.
10232	10232	39	40	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Well both the long bomber and the accurate type with a great short game can contend around Torrey. 2010, 2012 and 2016 saw Ben Crane and Brandt Snedeker triumph, But Bubba Watson, Tiger Woods, Scott Stallings, Jason Day and Jon Rahm are all longer hitters. So realistically we need a 285+ yard driver.
12741	12741	3	3	target: @JustinRose99 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reasons to like @JustinRose99 this week: – Most birdies/eagles made at ANGC since '12  – Highest GIR% in Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 5 score to par at Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 4 scoring avg at Masters last 5 years  – Best score to par overall in Masters since 2011 — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) April 2, 2018  He may only be 14/1 this week but when we talk of the word “overdue”, nothing quite personifies it like Rose at Augusta. If I had to pick one player who will be wearing that coveted Green Jacket come Sunday, Rose would be that man. Phil Mickelson 20/1 (Betfred) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson is playing as well as most in World Golf over the last two months, finishing in the top-24 in his last five straight stroke-play events, including his win in Mexico.
7450	7450	38	38	target: Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie is consistently deadly accurate off the tee, an above average putter, and he crushes the world with a short iron in his hands (4 from 125-150, 30 from 100-125). He’s more known as a par-4 scorer, but Reavie is also demolishing par-3s this year (2.98 scoring average, 6 ) and with four tough par-3s that will be crucial. Brendan Hagy ($6900): Although not a perfect fit, at $6900 Hagy has a lot to offer in terms of upside – especially when it comes to DraftKings scoring.
2734	2734	12	13	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I'm dipping a little deeper in the betting market this week. Ryan Moore ticks plenty of boxes this week at a course where he tends to play well. At a test where scoring is likely to be difficult, an experienced level-head is no bad thing.
6309	6309	32	33	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My only concern is he did not play the similar courses on tour very well this season, but he also wasn’t in good form in general, so I can let that slide. Bud Cauley (DK: $7,700, FD: $7,500)    TPC Potomac seems perfectly suited to Cauley’s game. He isn’t long off the tee but is accurate when he is able to club down.
5887	5887	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			275 yards (46th), 85.7% fairways (9th), 72.2% greens in regulation (34th), proximity to hole 32'0" (45th), 95.0% scrambling (1st), 1.67 putts per GIR (11th). 2010, Bubba Watson (-14). 321 yards (1st), 66.1% fairways (58th), 70.8% greens in regulation (38th), proximity to hole 31'5" (25th), 57.1% scrambling (43rd), 1.63 putts per GIR (2nd).
8381	8381	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are my picks for 2017 Northern Trust. Jason Day 20/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds) 2 pts e/w:  Jason Day looks to have found some consistency again and when that happens it is time to stand up and take notice. Day is still win-less so far this season, however he has twice gone close finishing 2nd at the AT&T Byron Nelson and T5 at Pebble Beach earlier in the year.
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
1417	1417	26	26	target: Blaum 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sitting 70th in Bogey Avoidance, 68th in Greens in Regulation and 30th in Strokes Gained Putting season-to-date are statistics which marry-up well with Waialae. At 33, Blaum has been around the block playing plenty of Latinoamerica and web.com Tour golf and Bermudagrass green results such as 4th & 5th at Louisiana Open (2015/16), 9th at BMW Charity Pro-Am (2015) and 7th Brasil Champions (2016) jump from the record books. Charles Howell III just begs to be included in the line-up this week.
8814	8814	8	8	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One other element is Player of the Year. Spieth rates the award highly and, as if winning two trophies and a $10million jackpot wasn't enough, it's another factor to motivate him. Justin Thomas has five wins, including a major, and must be favourite at it stands but Spieth could still change the script.
538	538	10	11	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13 Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke.
8198	8198	57	58	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Quail Hollow Club, Charlotte, North Carolina  7,600 yards, Par 71  The Course  Quail Hollow is the host course of the Wells Fargo Championship since 2003 and is a tough test measuring a lengthy 7,600 yards. Previous winners here include Brian Harman (2017), James Hahn (2016), Rory McIlroy (2015 and 2010) J.B. Holmes (2014), Derek Ernst (2013), Rickie Fowler (2012) and Lucas Glover (2011). The course was originally designed by golf course architect George Cobb in 1961 to capture the beauty as well as challenging terrain of the Piedmont region.
3902	3902	6	7	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s an excellent play this week. Adam Hadwin ($9,100) – No course seems to be too tough for Hadwin this season. He’s been red hot tee-to-green, and were it not for some bizarre putting errors on his part last week, he’d have likely been in contention for the win.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
7210	7210	34	34	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He came so close at Augusta, and I think he’ll seal the deal where his legend started 19 years ago – when he finished T-4 at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old. Also like: Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70.
4599	4599	40	40	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s all been his approach game. After losing (a lot) of strokes to the field on approach shots every event from February through April (3 MCs – And one DJ – and no finish better than T38 in six starts) Reed has it going the other way his last two times out. He gained 3.8 strokes on the Wells Fargo field with his irons, good for a T12, and another 4.8 at THE PLAYERS en route to a T22.
4862	4862	23	24	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was 9th for Putting Average at TPC Sawgrass and played beautifully in windy, technical conditions for much of the tournament. A confident Kyle Stanley is a player to watch and if the flat stick stays hot I can see him being a feature again this week on Bentgrass greens he prefers. RESULT: MC  Chris Kirk 0.75pt EW 66/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 :  Chris Kirk popped up with 12th at The Players Championship after months of obscurity and we all know that Georgia-based Kirk loves Colonial.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
3440	3440	27	28	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His combination of power, iron play, and poise should serve him very well regardless of the conditions, and you simply cannot beat the price tag this week. Bill Haas ($7,200) – Lost in the fray of big name, sexy picks will be boring Billy who could be the most patient golfer on the entire course this week. Regardless of the conditions – and he’s played every year since 2010 – Haas has carded nothing worse than a T42, and nothing worse than a T24 in the past four years.
86	86	15	16	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rostering one of my least favorite DFS players this week, based on a gut feeling: Chris Kirk.
10595	10595	7	7	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Catch him while he’s on the rise. Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside.
5746	5746	9	9	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Outside of his putting and around the green play, Day hasn’t been great lately and has now lost strokes to the field on approaches in six of his last eight rounds. Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts.
310	310	3	3	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
4959	4959	52	53	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
6550	6550	21	22	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We aren’t playing a lot of cash games this week due to the field strength, but we love Keegan in GPPs. Gary Woodland $7,500 – Woodland hasn’t sniffed a top ten since we were wearing sweaters in Georgia, but he’s a consistent cut maker with the upside to win potentially. He’s a bomber that can take advantage of these forgiving fairways.
13119	13119	29	30	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's where we come back to missing in the right place, because if you do scrambling is fairly easy. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that Adam Hadwin looks to have an outstanding chance at around the 40/1 mark. The Canadian hasn't putted particularly well this year, but otherwise his game is an ideal fit for Harbour Town as while he struggles a little off the tee due to a lack of power, he's deadly with his approach shots and rates one of the best scramblers on the circuit.
8226	8226	20	20	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips.
5779	5779	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two spots remaining, we have $18,300 left to work with. Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course.
2267	2267	30	30	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played well throughout the week but shot a disappointing 80 in round two but bounced back with a 64, 66 over the weekend to post nine under in total. Scott then played in his native Australian Open finishing T14 for the tournament on six under which included a second round 65. He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005.
8771	8771	7	8	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I'm going to keep hitting it." Jordan Spieth : "I like to come to a place that I look at as very similar to Augusta National. I think the layout, the feel, the slopes, it reminds me a lot of it.
9326	9326	30	31	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thomas, incidentally, won last year having finished 21st in 2016 so you only have to go back 12 months to find an example to help Leishman's cause. Final Bet: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 25/1  You'll find former Kapaula winners Spieth, DJ and Reed high up the 2017 Scrambling stats (Fowler was eighth) and looking at the same list helps lead us towards Kevin Kisner.
486	486	34	35	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston. Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week.
10118	10118	15	16	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie has 12th- and 17th-place ties in the last two years at the CareerBuilder, too. Webb Simpson  Happy learned how to putt. Uh oh.
1466	1466	26	26	target: Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Schniederjans ranked 19th in strokes gained tee-to-green in Hawaii and if he can get the putter working he could bag another big cheque. 1pt each-way Ollie Schniederjans at 200/1 Stan James  With low scoring a must in La Quinta I’m going with another Web.com Tour graduate in the form of JJ Spaun. The 26-year-old punched his ticket to the big league by winning the News Sentinel Open but it’s the style of his victories that I like.
5325	5325	8	9	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His personal best was a T13 in 2014. Roberto Castro … While he's been optimistic to point out that his form can be directly proportional to the time of year – that is, when it heats up nationwide, so does he – and while that's precisely what's occurred a couple of times since he splashed onto the PGA TOUR in 2012, he's still searching for a flint to spark this year's surge. As he creeps up on his 32nd birthday (on June 23), he's survived only one cut in his last nine starts.
12656	12656	68	70	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Six of the world’s Top 20 will tee it up in Houston. Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson and Henrik Stenson are the class of the field, follow edclosely by the second tier of Tony Finau, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Berger, defending champ Russell Henley, Luke List, Chez Reavie, Keegan Bradley, Peter Uihlein, Jason Dufner, Brandt Snedeker, J.B. Holmes, Ben An, Thomas Pieters, Yuta Ikeda, Charles Howell III and Indian wunderkind Shubhankar Sharma. Plus, there will be a spattering of PGA Tour regulars such as Bud Cauley, Kevin Tway, Jason Kokrak, Jamie Lovemark, Grayson Murray, Shane Lowry, Kevin Streelman, Scott Stallings, Emiliano Grillo, Lucas Glover, James HAHHHNNNNNN, Scott Piercy, Jhonattan Vegas, William McGirt, Chris Kirk, Bill Haas, Sung Kang, Russell Knox, John HUH??????
13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.

2051	2051	16	17	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is always a threat in less than normal conditions and this week is just that. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  We were high on Phil in Phoenix last week and he got it within two strokes of the lead making the turn on Sunday before posting a four-over 40 on the back nine to finish 16th. He will look to turn that around this week at a place he absolutely loves.
8287	8287	48	48	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has made five of his last six cuts and although he failed to make the weekend at the Canadian Open it was his best putting display (in terms of strokes gained) since the early months of the season. Sedgefield Country Club often descends into a shootout and Kim could deliver on his promise. Bet with Sky Bet and get 6 places at 1/4 odds.
10036	10036	4	4	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very similarly to Kirk, Knox had an ‘of the boil’ year in 2017, however in almost identical fashion to Kirk he showed signs of life towards the end of 2017 before starting 2018 with a 10th place at the Sony Open. In fact I could almost copy and paste my above thoughts on Kirk and run with them again for Knox! He has form a plenty on Pete Dye courses and I’m not at all surprised to see him now adding this event back on to his schedule after missing it the last two years.
9206	9206	20	20	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although past course history should not be entirely ignored Perez really has shown he is a new player now. Gary Woodland – Cash Games – DK: $9400 FD: $9000  Woodland looked good last week finishing T18 and has shown solid form lately with six straight made cuts. Finishing 2nd here last season Woodland is sure to draw high ownership on both DraftKings and FanDuel given his salary.
12059	12059	26	26	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season. Of his eight PGA events, Grillo has two top-10s, including at a very tough Honda Classic in which he finished T8. Grillo performs well on tough courses, can play in the wind and is a very strong second-shot golfer.
3812	3812	11	12	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am forgiving him for last week's MC at Augusta National. Jason Dufner (8): His game looks balanced for a change as his putting has been strong recently. If he keeps the putter hot then there is no reason he shouldn't be near the top of the leaderboard come Sunday.
2108	2108	35	35	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He only finished behind winner, Bubba Watson and runner-up Dustin Johnson so he was bettered by two of the very best on the PGA Tour. In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory.
1024	1024	7	8	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			• • •  Mike Glasscott  Projected champion: Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world.
11849	11849	19	19	target: Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That same person isn’t going to magically lead in Driving Distance if they’re not a bomber. And what does Streelman do well? He’s incredibly efficient getting to the green.
8416	8416	12	12	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
55	55	7	8	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Wyndham Championship top 10 picks  1. Patrick Reed -- Reed is a former winner here, doing that in 2013 for his first PGA Tour win. He had a good finish in Rio (final-round wise), and he's been a top-15 mainstay most of the summer.
5617	5617	34	34	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s not as long off the tee as some of the bigger names (only 295 yards on average), but he hits the fairway consistently. Sitting 7th in Ball-Striking (combination of Total Driving and GIR), Casey has been great on Approach (3rd in SG:App), although a little lacking outside 200 yards which could mean some trouble. Between 150-17 and 175-200 however, Casey is 9th and 4th respectively and overall ranks 23rd in Proximity to the Hole which has helped him find 70.68% of Greens in Regulation.
10283	10283	59	59	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There doesn’t appear to be a huge advantage in stacking tee times at the moment; although, if one of the first two days’ forecasts improves a bit, it might be better to have your player on the South course when the weather is better. Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top-10 performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016).
3876	3876	47	48	target: Charley Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 15, and local guy, Patrick Reed headlines the field, along with just eight others currently inside the Top 50 in the world rankings: Matt Kuchar (17), Branden Grace (21), Brooks Koepka (24), Jimmy Walker (25), Ryan Moore (28), Kevin Chappell (41), Adam Hadwin (46), and Charley Hoffman (49). The Masters this is not.
11478	11478	22	22	target: Luiten 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My main fancy in Mexico is a fairly speculative one on first look but yet given he won his last tournament, Joost Luiten perhaps shouldn’t be the outsider that the market makes him at 125/1*. Luiten was last seen getting the better of Ryder Cup player Chris Wood in Oman two weeks ago and unusually he putted very well. It is normally tee-to-green supremacy that we associate with Luiten and it was that part of his game that was on show at Chapultepec last year as he ranked 1st in drving accuracy and 1st in GIR.
8742	8742	35	36	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			East Lake is always a test where tee-to-green prowess prevails and with potentially soft conditions in play for a segment of the tournament, I will happily take Rose who's certainly on a roll. RESULT: T10  Webb Simpson 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 using code SPORTS60 , T&Cs apply (4 places, 1/4 odds):  I will finish the 2016/17 PGA Tour season with Webb Simpson. Always the sort who's a true "horse for the course", it's noticeable that the Tour Championship is often contended for by players ranked in the mid-teens when it comes to FEC standing.
1444	1444	2	2	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think Patrick Cantlay is worth support at 40/1 in the @attproam. Cantlay won his first @PGATOUR title towards the e… https://t.co/9JX6aPY6BO
1527	1527	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Early in the season, I like to go with a player who has started hot. Kevin Kisner had a great weekend at the Sony Open and when he gets hot, he can go low. This week the winner will need to go low.
3521	3521	19	20	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Slight preference is for Leishman as the Aussie has a T4 here from 2013 while Hadwin is a first-timer. Bill Haas is another at a big-looking 100/1 while, at 110s, I've always felt Ryan Moore has a big Masters in him at some point. At opposite ends of the age scale, it wouldn't surprise me at all if three-time winner Phil Mickelson and Spanish sensation Jon Rahm are part of a Sunday showdown.
221	221	3	3	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
6581	6581	18	18	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls. People are moving off of Reed at a point in the season he is playing his best golf. Four of his last five events have resulted in a T20 or better finish.
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
8733	8733	8	9	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Marc Leishman  3. Pat Perez  MY PICK : Rickie Fowler ($10,700)  Fowler hasn’t played poorly in the first two events of the postseason, it’s just seemed that way because he’s been badly outshone by a couple of his peers. The truth is, Fowler has actually had one of the most consistent seasons of his career, statistically speaking, but he’s just had only one win to show for it.
7689	7689	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
1250	1250	31	31	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.
2785	2785	13	14	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			USA TODAY Sports  Here are some golfers to consider for this weeks card. Jason Dufner - Jason Dufner has three straight top-25 finishes and enters this week ranked 14th in driving accuracy percentage and sand save percentage. Dufner is hitting a good ball right now and enters an event where he’s finished top-30 in each of his last eight appearances.
6455	6455	1	1	target: Randolph 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jonathan Randolph ($6900) – A better putter than his SG: Putting rank of 100 would suggest, Randolph is very good at one-putting (40.9%) and is nails from 4-8’ (7 th in 148 attempts) which isn’t listed as a “key” stat, but is encompassed in the 5-10’ putting range that has some importance. Randolph is great from short distances and like Vaughn is known for his accuracy. He missed the cut in 2015 (only attempt) but has shown better form in making seven of his last ten events, including a T8.
3256	3256	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Jimmy Walker: $7,600  At No. 22 in the Official World Golf Ranking, Jimmy Walker's pedigree should command something higher than a $7,600 salary. He hasn't missed a cut in his past six starts in Houston.
6813	6813	24	25	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.
12854	12854	13	13	target: Hadwin’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I mean, it doesn’t hurt. But most of it has to do with Hadwin’s elite iron play the past six weeks. Hadwin is averaging 5.3 strokes gained on his approaches over his last three starts, good for finishes of T6, T9 and T12.
13161	13161	19	19	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yep, we're definitely in KK country this week and I fully expect to see him up there. Last year, Kisner said: "I just feel like it's a great shot-maker's course. You can be in the fairway and have to carve shots into the pin.
6533	6533	3	4	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Jason Sobel  Jimmy Walker  Just when you thought he was done, Walker gets to return to a course where it has always been feast or famine: two missed cuts (including 2014, the last time he played the tournament), as well as two fourth-place ties and a runner-up to boot. "Sky" Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31.
11563	11563	2	2	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I want DJ as my anchor. DraftKings Picks:    Dustin Johnson ($11,900): He's the defending champ here and playing well early in the year. Branden Grace ($7,700): Had a pair of podium finishes in alittude over the last four months.
11917	11917	53	54	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			More realistic are the claims of Luke List, Jason Kokrak and Jamie Lovemark, three big-hitting maidens who have all looked like winners-in-waiting for some time, and all have something to recommend them here. However, Bay Hill remains a subtle layout despite Jason Day's bomb-and-putt deconstruction two years ago and the all-round quality of Zach Johnson appears more likely to be rewarded. The two-time major champion would be a fitting winner of an event so significant, and having been inside the top 25 in seven of his eight starts dating back to the BMW Championship last September, Johnson is in the sort of form which makes him a big contender at around the 66/1 mark.
3436	3436	57	58	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There were some indications of possible functional impairments (Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed) continuing to rear their ugly heads, but otherwise, there’s a distinct possibility that some of these guys just played uber aggressively knowing that they wanted to get to Augusta early to start their preparation. Obviously, I have no concrete evidence to support that, but a Jordan Spieth 77 on a course that easy, for instance, is an utterly bizarre happening. Let’s review some key player performances:  Russell Henley: Henley was my “hold my nuts and hope” fade this week, and apparently it was rightfully so.
5714	5714	25	25	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has also played well at the US Open in the past finishing T10 in Merion in 2013 and a T2 in Pinehurst in 2014. Fowler also ticks a lot of statistical boxes here ranking 33rd in driving distance, 25th in driving accuracy, 29th in GIR, seventh in strokes gained putting and 22nd in scrambling. When you weigh it all up its hard not to fancy Rickie’s chances here in Erin Hills.
2117	2117	20	20	target: Laird’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
11494	11494	19	20	target: Thomas Pieters, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a somewhat risky option but is priced modestly given he won the last time he teed it up. Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week.
7803	7803	10	10	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of my lineups will have Casey on them. Adam Scott ($8,800) – Seriously, why is Adam Scott priced in the 8k range whenever there is a strong field. Scott has 3 top 15’s in his last 4 tries here to go with a win back in 2011.
6050	6050	29	29	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
9520	9520	25	25	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
10396	10396	22	22	target: Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cherry Hills: Winner: Billy Horschel; EW Places: Watson, Hoffmann, Fowler, Palmer. TPC Summerlin: Winner: Ben Martin; EW Places: Streelman, Knox, Simpson, Finau, Piercy. 2015 :  Old White: Winner: Danny Lee; EW Places: Streb, Henley, Hahn.
7746	7746	38	38	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A fantastic long game has always been the Japanese sensation's biggest asset - 302 yards off the tee and Total Driving ranks of 21st in 2016 and 13th for the season-to-date doesn't tell a lie - however when Hideki is most dangerous is when the flat stick is cooperating too and he's in the middle of a purple patch in that respect right now which should spell danger to the rest of the field. 3rd for putting average at Erin Hills (1.63 putts per GIR), 15th at Portstewart (1.68) and 2nd at Birkdale (1.67) is the best prolonged spell we've seen from Matsuyama since he won an incredible 5 events in 9 global starts either side of Christmas. With confidence clearly growing once again with the putter it will only take a decent ball-striking week on a course which suits like Firestone for him to be knocking on the door once again.
10206	10206	63	63	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event. Even so, an $8,900 salary on FanDuel this week has a significant amount of value in it if Woods makes the cut and shows very capable top-25 upside. He won the event in 2013, but Woods is clearly a different golfer now in 2018.
12025	12025	29	30	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
4507	4507	73	73	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jack Nicklaus landed the inaugural edition in 1974, former World No.1s Greg Norman, Nick Price, David Duval, Kaymer and Jason Day have all triumphed as have countless other major winners. Rory can still get frustrated here but with a few doubts over some of his main rivals - DJ's poor record, Day's modest form, Spieth's two missed cuts here in 2015 and 2016 - the path could be clear for four-time major winner McIlroy to get his hands on the trophy. Fourth at Bay Hill on his last start in Florida and T7 at Augusta National, he should be fresh as a daisy after his layoff earlier in the year.
6070	6070	2	2	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2015, Casey gained a massive 10 strokes to the field with the strength of his approach game, and that’s a repeatable skill that should help him this week. Focusing on his approach game, Casey’s currently third-best on Tour for SG: App, sits 9th in the key 150-175 range (29th from that spot out of the rough), and has found the fifth-most greens. Unlike Spieth, Casey has actually found some success off the tee – albeit not to the point where he’s a top-10 player, but he’s been consistent enough not to lose strokes in that area.
8063	8063	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the length of the course it is good to have a bigger hitter on board and Finau fits that bill, ranking 6th in Driving Distance on the PGA Tour. Anything in the three-figure mark about a player with Finau’s upside is worth a second look and I think he can go well here, especially if he finally gets the putter rolling. Even when finishing 5th in Canada last time out, Finau only ranked 55th in Strokes Gained: Putting, losing strokes on the field (-.405) and unfortunately this is definitely his Achilles Heel.
5379	5379	20	21	target: Graeme McDowell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s also got the same Vegas odds to win as defending champion, Daniel Berger, nearly $900 more expensive on DraftKings. Graeme McDowell $7,500 – GMac has missed one cut all year and plays Harbour Town in Hilton Head like he built it. We see Harbour Town as a related course to TPC Southwind.
5267	5267	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			24th in strokes gained: total. Charley Hoffman: $6,500  A definite head-scratcher priced this low, Charley Hoffman is 15th on Tour this season in strokes gained: off-the-tee and 29th in strokes gained: tee-to-green. In other words, another solid player here, folks.
9934	9934	14	14	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should his putting revert to anything like normal this week, there’s a good chance Palmer has a good week at a course and event he clearly enjoys. Since 2006, Palmer has finished inside the top-10 on five occasions, including a 2nd in 2014 and a 4th in 2011. Palmer has also only missed the cut twice in that span, so he generally sticks around for the whole week here.
2575	2575	22	23	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
7694	7694	1	1	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas, $6,900. His record at Firestone is OK, but Haas has been solid for months up until a missed cut at the Open. He’s in good form and a high finish is right around the corner.
2445	2445	27	28	target: Adam Scott: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can keep the pieces together and continue to play big boy golf on the big stages, he’s one of the best ball-strikers in the game. Adam Scott: It was a rather lethargic performance for Adam Scott, although he posted one of the better Sunday rounds to get himself up to a T14 finish despite a poor 71 on Saturday. The putter was a mess, and he most definitely did not pay off the gigantic price we were required to fork over for him.
6845	6845	9	9	target: McNealy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wesley Bryan at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  1pt e.w. Maverick McNealy at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Rookies, non-winners, the never-hads and probably-never-will-bes should all be on high alert this week at the John Deere Classic. When not being carved up by Steve Stricker or Zach Johnson, TPC Deere Run has proven a profitable venue for players to break their duck on the PGA Tour and a lack of real depth at the top of the betting could well open the door once again for a maiden success.
2063	2063	14	14	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Try The Fantasy Fanatics today and build your own PGA DFS projection model. Justin Rose ($9,200)  Rose, like Spieth, is one of the hottest golfers in the event this week. He's coming off of a fourth-place finish at the Farmers and a runner-up at the Sony.
10873	10873	3	3	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 50 starts? Casey has made the top 10 in 40% of them. Filter it down to top sevens (the number of payout places on offer) and it's 26%.
12984	12984	41	41	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Noren ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 48th in GIR, 16th in SGTTG, 17th in strokes gained putting, 26th in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. After a missed cut on his only appearance here last year, Noren arrives in much better form this time around. Kiradech Aphibarnrat 100/1  The in form Thai looks great value here this week given his current run of form.
4980	4980	19	19	target: Hoffman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perez’s 69.3 LT Adj Rd Score is 16th, and his 14.2 LT Adj Bird Avg is tenth overall. Charley Hoffman: Hoffman has had some mixed results at Colonial, but he has three top-20 finishes — including a top-10 performance — and zero missed cuts in his last six appearances. He is tied for 23rd with his 69.5 LT Adj Rd Score.
2910	2910	14	14	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s also playing pretty well with two top 5’s in his last 4 starts. Rose loves playing here at Bay Hill. This will be his 11 appearance overall, and in his previous 10 starts 5 top 10’s.
10284	10284	14	15	target: 2016—Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top-10 performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016). The other four either hadn’t played for at least three weeks or finished outside the top 30 the week prior.
1632	1632	33	33	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course record at the South Course still remains 62 which was shot by Woods in 1999. The record at the old North Course was 61, shot by both Mark Brooks (1990) and Snedeker (2007). If the North Course, as expected plays slightly tougher, the 61 may remain intact, whilst the 62 from Tiger on the South Course has already stood the test of time.
6553	6553	19	19	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			English has recovered from his midseason missed cut stretch with 4/5 straight made cuts. Looking at his Vegas odds English stands out in his price range and I think he does without a crazy high level of ownership. Much like Finau the weakest part of his game is minimized at this course.
1594	1594	8	8	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wow. Even with a nasty backslide on Sunday, Rahm still did what Rahm does best and birdied his way back to even par on the day. He’s just a sensational talent and an excellent candidate to find his first win this season.
1865	1865	12	12	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back. Jones played in his first event of 2017 last week in Phoenix, saving his best round until last. A final-round 66 saw Jones climb the leaderboard, finishing T36.
3230	3230	15	15	target: Billy”, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This will be the third stroke-play event in a row I have gone for “Alligator Billy”, so I hope he repays the faith this week. Another player that fits the same mould as Horschel is Russell Henley, who is also somewhat of a course specialist. Henley has finished 5-4-7 here on his last three starts and ranks 13th in Par-4 Efficiency 450-500 yards and 20th in Greens in Regulation.
7388	7388	21	21	target: Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
4085	4085	46	47	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ownership projections you see here are my initial projections and will be updated as the week goes on so be sure to follow me on twitter to find out where you can get all the most updated ownership information. While it’s still early, this week Patrick Reed looks to be a good candidate if you’re looking for low ownership. While it’s clear he isn’t playing great now, his price has continued to drop and at some point you can expect Patrick Reed to bounce back.
9711	9711	24	24	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee. This play is all ownership dependent, currently, we are projecting Thomas at around 14% in GPP’s but that could all change throughout the week before we do a final update for VIP members. Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event.
1043	1043	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
4374	4374	10	11	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you grab a Berger this week in tournaments. William McGirt $7,900 – McGirt has some ties with North Carolina, and he’s been in solid form his last two events. He’s another ball striker type that is especially deadly with his irons.
886	886	5	5	target: @SmylieKaufman10 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After being on 309/1 winner @SmylieKaufman10 here 2 years ago I'm backing him again at 66/1 in @ShrinersOpen. Kaufman was tied 4th on Sunday
4198	4198	25	25	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The team dynamic was huge, something they analysed and looked back on recently. "We've been mates for a long time and we play good together," Grace told pgatour.com. "Obviously with our history at the Presidents Cup, it's been great and I think this is a good chance to get a win under the belt as a team.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
4474	4474	3	3	target: Henley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well.
3958	3958	34	34	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take him each-way at 50/1 to follow in the footsteps of Wesley Bryan and secure a first PGA Tour win. At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s.
750	750	1	1	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential. He’s a lock.
1406	1406	29	30	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 2: Jimmy Walker ($9.9m); 3: Brandt Snedeker ($9.7m); 4: Jason Dufner ($7.7m); 5: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 6: Justin Thomas ($10.5m); 7: Russell Henley ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($8.5m); 9: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.7m). Predictor Positives: Jordan Spieth dominates the Predictor model this week with a virtual 500 point gap to 'course horse' Jimmy Walker.
141	141	41	41	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also won consecutively in 2014 where he was victorious at Congressional on the PGA Tour then again a fortnight later at Royal Aberdeen on the European Tour. 2nd (Liberty National) and 6th (Plainfield) at The Barclays since 2011, an in-form Rose should give those who are shorter in the market a run for their money at the very least. RESULT: T31  Hideki Matsuyama 1.25pts EW 30/1 with  I wasn't expecting to see 30/1 about Hideki Matsuyama but I'm happy to take it.
3766	3766	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
4553	4553	47	47	target: Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season. With that drama now behind him Poulter should be free to “swing freely” at this event, where he’s had some success in the past, including a runner-up finish from 2009. What I like most about Poulter here though is his recent form.
422	422	48	48	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps it simply took him a while to figure things out at TPC Boston, as he tied for 70th in 2013 and tied for 74th the following year in his first two starts on the course. For those who were playing attention, it was no real surprise that Reed claimed his fifth PGA Tour victory at Bethpage Black because he finished second in the Valero Texas Open and the Hyundai Tournament of Champions earlier this year, two of his 10 finishes in the top 10. 5.
5627	5627	3	4	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance.
11106	11106	32	33	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  6 - Tiger Woods  4 - Jim Furyk, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Camilo Villegas. 2 - Daniel Berger, Ben Crane, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Fabian Gomez, Russell Henley, Billy Horschel, Chris Kirk, Ryan Palmer, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker.
7905	7905	16	16	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also the defending champ at Firestone, a course that suits him. -- Bob Harig  Adam Scott  Adam has been playing this event since 2003 and hasn't missed one since that first start! The good news; Scott is coming off a reasonable showing at the Open (T-22) and last year he finished T-10 at this event.
509	509	19	20	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He certainly had higher hopes for a season that started pretty strongly. • • •  Adam Schupak  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. The player who most reminds me of Long John Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA at Crooked Stick, is my pick.
494	494	23	23	target: Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of guys who show up in Houston show up at Wells Fargo and DBC leaderboards... i'm defintely putting a few $$$ on Castro at 275-1
4647	4647	45	45	target: Huh 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He doesn’t make as many birdies as one would like for DK scoring, but on a course where there aren’t that many birdies to go around, he’s a fine play – he also checks off the Par-4 Scoring box, with an average of 3.99 (22nd). Huh also missed the cut last week, but had fine finishes at Valero (T22) and Valspar (T9). He’s had an 8th and 16th place finish here (2013 and 2014 respectively), but missed the cut last year.
963	963	12	13	target: Vaughn Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, that kind of performance would do me just fine. Vaughn Taylor ($6,300) – Expect this play to be hugely contrarian. Another player who relies on his ball striking which should suit the course.
4160	4160	23	23	target: Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He made the cut in his only appearance at the Valero Texas Open. While he's struggled with his normally steady putting this year, Poulter is 10th on Tour in strokes gained: around the green. But again, it's the qualitative elements that make Poults a must play.
6763	6763	13	13	target: Alex 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a very solid Tee to Green game and likes the course. Alex Cejka ($6,700) – I have dabbled with success in taking Cejka throughout this year and last weekend was his best start of the year finishing T9. Cejka has had two appearances at the JDC making the cut in both.
4565	4565	31	31	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday. Martin Kaymer – $7,300  Martin Kaymer will be the most popular player this week and he is still a staple for me in cash and GPP lineups.
9709	9709	5	5	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Army Pricing  Picks  Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $11600 FD: $12600  The disappointment of last week for the top end looks to be a great GPP this week as he should see suppressed ownership. Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success.
11228	11228	17	17	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In two previous starts at PGA National he has finished 17th or better. -- Zach Turcotte  Brian Gay  Between his poor course history and not being a household name, Gay is going to be off most people's radar this week. Couple those things with a missed cut at last week's Genesis Open, and you might think I'm crazy.
9464	9464	2	2	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Kyle Stanley  Stanley was both the hero and anti-hero to so many PGA DFSers last year, choking away insanely good performances with some of the most biblically bad putting you’ll ever see out of anyone. However, if there’s one thing yours truly loves to see, it’s consistency, and Kyle Stanley was an absolute monster in that department, carding an average of 1.259 SG:T2G per round despite playing a very busy 29 event schedule.
5818	5818	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose’s 2017 stats aren’t quite as sharp as always but he still sits prominently in many of the key ones for this week. Rose is 25th in driving distance, 14th in GIR, 13th in strokes gained: tee to green and 10th in scoring relative to par for approaches over 200 yards. Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong.
7934	7934	44	44	target: Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CAVEAT: putting is so variable week to week that it’s never good to rely on that, but with such a strong game in getting to the green, even if Rickie putts poorly this week he’ll still be in contention. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Thomas Pieters ($7500): Unfortunately this won’t be a week where Pieters gets overlooked at an excellent price like at Augusta or the Open, after his excellent performance at the WGC Bridgestone (sitting in first place at the time of writing) – as an aside, Firestone CC is a decent comparable course for Quail Hollow. Pieters still gets his feature in this space for the second week in a row thanks to his excellent iron play which will be so crucial this week, and his ability to absolutely smash the ball off the tee when needed.
3239	3239	48	48	target: Peterson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Total Points staked this week: 3  Profit/Loss for 2017: – 36  I have purposely kept stakes to a minimum this week, as I didn’t want to get too involved in this event. Horschel was too obvious to ignore, whilst I have been looking for a chance to back Peterson, and Texas is as arguably the best place to get him on side. Ross Fisher looked like giving us a run for our money last week, only to be knocked out by Hideto Tanihara in the quarter finals.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
1303	1303	9	10	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fabian Gomez: 6th ToC/44th RSM/1st Personal Classic/MC Argentine Open. Jimmy Walker: 2nd ToC/9th Shark Shoot/15th World Challenge/35th HSBC. Jimmy Walker: 21st ToC/44th HSBC/6th CIMB/12th Shriners/1st Fry's.com.
532	532	20	20	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His switch back to a Scotty Cameron flat stick already seems to be paying dividends. Along with the improved putting, McIlroy ranks first on tour in both P5S and BoB, with ranks of fourth in PROX and 10th in DD. He has struggled with consistency this year but the small field allows owners to pay up for his tier-topping salary.
4635	4635	39	39	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have. It’s easy to eat his salary this week with the players below, so here’s how DJ fares in the crucial categories:  Bogey Avoidance – 3 rd  Birdie or Better % – 6 th  SG: Tee to Green – 1 st  Par-4 Scoring – 2nd  Johnson has also finished no worse than T12 in his last three years here, and has never missed a cut at TPC Four Seasons. Zac Blair ($6600): The second-best scrambler on Tour (and best in the field), Blair also sits in an elite group in the Bogey Avoidance category (9th).
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can’t look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
11116	11116	9	9	target: Thomas' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the record, Kapalua on Maui features TifEagle Bermudagrass. Thomas' Florida record isn't too bad either. 10th (2015) on course debut at Copperhead, 3rd (2016) at TPC Sawgrass and 3rd (2016) here were all achieved in Justin's first 7 tournaments in the Sunshine State and before he became the winning machine he is today.
5062	5062	31	32	target: Stewart Cink. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the last ten winners, eight were ranked inside the top-20 on tour for adjusted scoring average. One name you wouldn’t expect to fit the category based on his odds is Stewart Cink. The former Open Champion is still looking for his first win since his 2009 major but is playing some excellent golf of late.
6050	6050	49	49	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
8989	8989	23	23	target: Wesley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some guys are consistent, some are not, Pieters falls into the second category and he could see suppressed ownership because of recent results. Wesley Bryan – DK: $6800 FD: $5200  He is not much of a birdie maker but Bryan is underpriced based on ability and is a sneaky course fit. In his short PGA career, Bryan has found success on short, easy golf courses.
1509	1509	1	1	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @Thomas_Pieters at 50/1 in the #GenesisOpen. The Belgian won the 2012 NCAA title at Riviera and proved it wa… https://t.co/FAomjT6QXN

4394	4394	14	14	target: Ogilvy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given some of the shared characteristics between Eagle Point and Quail Hollow, I’m guessing Ogilvy will find this week’s venue at least somewhat to his liking as well. While he’s more of a GPP play, Ogilvy is a player you can target given his improved recent form (13th overall in Strokes Gained: Tee to Green at the Valero) and affinity for this event/region. He’ll likely be extremely low owned in tournaments and could be a difference maker on a difficult looking course that may not yield many low scores.
5653	5653	20	20	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 34-year-old has taken his game to a new level and there aren’t many better iron players in the world. Molinari is ranked second in strokes gained with approaches to the green and is fifth for adjusting scoring average on the PGA Tour. Erin Hills is said to be a ‘second shot’ course and that plays to his strengths.
1248	1248	13	13	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And his putting and especially scrambling leave something to be desired. But, like Watson, he's still done well at Kapalua. Jason Dufner - $7,400 (40-1)    Dufner's last visit to the TOC was in 2014, when he tied for fifth.
9871	9871	19	20	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It could then go the other way, a little spell in a trough before the good stuff comes back. Brian Harman had it going from April to June when winning the Wells Fargo Championship and making a big challenge at the US Open. He managed only two top 20s in nine starts after that but he's found a real purple patch over the last few months with a run of five straight top 10s.
6418	6418	16	16	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nothing else really takes my fancy so, instead, I'm going to switch markets and back Stewart Cink for a top 10. Cink is 60/1 in the outrights but a couple of things temper expectations. First, this is his tournament debut and, second, he's not won since the 2009 Open Championship.
1827	1827	37	37	target: Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're betting in-running on Sunday, be very wary of the par five 14th hole, as it's far from a certain birdie hole. It had a big say in the outcome yet again 12 months ago with Mickelson, Johan Blixt and Freddie Jacobson, who finished second, third and fourth, all making bogey there. There were only seven birdies there in round four last year and it ranked as the fourth hardest hole on the course and in the 2010 renewal it caused absolute carnage.
433	433	9	9	target: Jason 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It will behoove players to stay accurate here. A:  Jason Day - He's getting hot at the right time, 2nd in FedEx rankings, Jason has 7 top ten finishes in his last 10 starts. Add to that his great record of play here: 12th (2015), 7th (2014), 13th (2013).
3828	3828	29	29	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hadwin recently got married, but he's put off the honeymoon to keep his momentum going by riding a hot putter that has him eighth in strokes gained/putting on tour. Luke Donald: Poor, Luke. He didn't qualify for the Masters and then Sergio Garcia abandoned their game of Worlds With Friends over the weekend.
7537	7537	32	32	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
749	749	0	2	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Si Woo Kim showed showed some life at the Valero with a T22. If he's healthy, he and Kang could be a formidable duo at 70/1 in the Zurich.
1445	1445	4	4	target: @BrandtSnedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First #ATTProAm bet is @BrandtSnedeker at 49/1. Snedeker absolutely loves Pebble Beach and has two wins here since… https://t.co/vL4CebF7GI
909	909	18	19	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome.

Yahoo!
7964	7964	24	24	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His full form there: 1-MC-2-10-8-1-4. After the lows of the Irish and Scottish Opens (MC in both) and slumping to 5-over at Royal Birkdale, McIlroy has turned a corner with back-to-back top fives at the Open and WGC-Bridgestone. Quite simply, he looks Europe’s standout this week and must have a huge chance of winning this tournament for a third time after lifting the hefty Wanamaker trophy in 2012 and 2014.
6351	6351	2	2	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, Taylor stands out to me in the range of players in the bottom few $100 of salary. Our VIP Spreadsheet shows Taylor gaining strokes to the field Tee-to-Green which is huge anytime you can get a punt play who is doing that. If I need to go low salary wise this week I have no issue filling out some line-ups with Taylor.
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
5413	5413	86	86	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There doesn’t appear to be any rain in the forecast for Memphis throughout the tournament, but temperatures are expected to heat up on Saturday and Sunday. Past Champions    2016 - Daniel Berger  2015 - Fabian Gomez  2014 - Ben Crane  2013 - Harris English  2012 - Dustin Johnson  2011 - Harrison Frazar  2010 - Lee Westwood  2009 - Brian Gay    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Brooks Koepka - $18,000  Adam Scott - $17,600  Francesco Molinari - $17,100  Phil Mickelson - $16,900    Cash-game Target (50/50s, Double-Ups): Despite earning headlines for his decision to skip next week’s U.S. Open in order to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, Mickelson is a safe deployment at the top of cash-game lineups this week. He hasn’t missed a single cut all season and has produced four consecutive quality results at this event with finishes of T2-T11-T3-T2 since 2013.
2597	2597	4	5	target: Jordan Spieth: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la creme  Jordan Spieth: $11,500  Here's the thought: The caddie-player pairing of Greller and Spieth > (Austin) Johnson and (Dustin) Johnson at a new track featuring an abundance of elevation-related calculations. A winner at Pebble Beach, Spieth is currently the tour leader in strokes gained: approach-the-green. DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish.
11928	11928	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas. That's some turnaround, especially as he led the field in greens hit last time out, and on balance has to be considered an overreaction.
1117	1117	11	12	target: CHRIS STROUD 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$GOLF DFS CORE FOUR$ Sony PGA MARC LEISHMAN SI WOO KIM CHRIS STROUD KEVIN NA BMW SA @EuropeanTour ERIK VAN ROOYEN… https://t.co/D1kstsROod
10025	10025	2	2	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
10696	10696	23	23	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With great current form so far this season and I expect him to have a decent week especially with his record here. Chesson Hadley 45/1  I like the look of the in-form Chesson Hadley on a course he has expressed his liking for in the past. Hadley has been playing well over the last couple of months with four top 5’s and a top 25 in his last eight starts.
3688	3688	48	49	target: Branden Grace, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Perhaps remembering the early days of golf betting and the advice of Keith Elliott, I've always tended to back players at Hilton Head who didn't put themselves in the heat of battle at Augusta the week before. And this week's defending champion, Branden Grace, fits the bill. Grace was a nearest-the-finish T27 at Augusta but, rather than view that as a slight disappointment, he was probably relatively pleased given that he'd previously missed his last three cuts at the Masters.
12267	12267	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years. Since the introduction of the new format, the last three winners have won all three of their group stage matches, confirming the elite level of play needed to get the job done here.
309	309	27	28	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
564	564	0	0	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings again this week. His $/pt better than ave (line) on handy GP chart for… https://t.co/aAFKO8CfgR
10142	10142	45	45	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Martin might not have the greatest course history at this event (MC-T34-MC), but he comes into this year’s edition in solid form and with the ability to put up a lot of birdies on a venue that favors iron play and putting over pure power. Martin also has played well in the desert before, too, winning the Las Vegas-based Shriners Hospital event back in 2015 at 20-under par. At under $7K this week, he brings serious upside for a low price.
9574	9574	37	38	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hitting greens in regulation won’t be an issue for most of the field, placing an emphasis on more specific statistics such as average proximity to the hole and SG: putting. Past Champions    2017- Justin Thomas  2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jordan Spieth - $15,900    Spieth is the most expensive player on the board this week thanks to his brilliant combination of course history and recent form. The No.
12883	12883	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
12995	12995	19	19	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However regarding this plan to restrict one market for each pick, the highest possible target makes sense. I rate Chappell a genuine contender this week and reckon he will thrive in this major over time. Last year's seventh suggested that, as does his skill-set and record on tough courses.
12469	12469	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course does grade out as a pretty strong fit so maybe, just maybe, he can break out of his massive slump. The Specialists  Retief Goosen  Emiliano Grillo  The specialist this week is Retief Goosen. The South African has flashed some form early in the year but no real consistency.
11928	11928	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas. That's some turnaround, especially as he led the field in greens hit last time out, and on balance has to be considered an overreaction.
1982	1982	13	13	target: Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
12455	12455	28	28	target: Lashley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I will point out a few golfers I think are overvalued in the raw rankings and a few that are undervalued in the raw rankings. UNDERRATED GOLFERS    Nate Lashley (29.95 Projected Pts): Lashley won't impress you with his cuts-made ratio on the PGA TOUR so far (3-for-10 this season). However, when we realize he is top 50 on TOUR in bogey avoidance, we can assume a correction is in order.
5822	5822	27	27	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That win was at Royal Aberdeen which I alluded to earlier. Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week.
3492	3492	2	2	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th). His putting will need to improve this week, but Augusta greens are a different challenge than anything the South African has faced this season and he knows exactly what to expect of them, after eight starts here.
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
1278	1278	50	51	target: Jimmy Walker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you don’t roster these guys unless you are playing in the Junkies Season Long Golf League, then by all means feel free to take that goose egg. Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know.
2507	2507	22	22	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hard to see him not winning at some point soon and could easily catch everyone off-guard here. I see only upside with Kaymer who was one of only a few players who managed to shoot par or better in all four rounds last week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7,200): Maybe the strangest price of anyone, Oosthuizen put together his third straight solid start last week and also had four rounds of par or better at the Honda—and also lead the field in Greens in Regulation percentage.
3997	3997	15	15	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Curtis Luck ($6,300): *write-up coming*  Others: Danny Lee, Harold Varner III  High-upside GPP Picks  Billy Horschel ($8,900): Not a play I’m admittedly super confident in but a player whose upside at this course I still respect (much like Luke Donald last week). Horschel is coming off a terrible Friday round at Hilton Head but after a week to recharge (his family just welcomed another child to the world as well) I think he can rebound nicely here. Horschel has always liked tougher tracks and is -13 with no rounds worse than par at TPC San Antonio over his last eight rounds played there.
5708	5708	20	21	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rosie’s price tag is too cheap, and he’s consistently overlooked in majors on DraftKings despite a great performance. Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,500 – “Kiz” joined us on the Tour Junkies Podcast this week after seeing Erin Hills and believes that it’s going to come down to keeping it in the fairway off the tee, chipping off these tight lies around the greens, and solid putting. Basically…that’s Kevin Kisner!
8796	8796	46	47	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Marc Leishman did us a huge favour when winning at 45/1 last week but he led from gun to tape and I fancy that would have taken a lot out of him. I'll stay in the 'without Spieth' market and finish off with a punt on Webb Simpson at 33s (he's 40s with). As the each-way terms are still 1/5 1,2,3,4,5 with Spieth taken out, a top six finish for Simpson gets us in the money.
12383	12383	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
2447	2447	7	8	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great play in all formats. Adam Scott ($9,200) – Greens, you say? How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world?
6659	6659	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler finished T-3 with Marc Leishman contributing a T-5, but Patrick Reed was the only other top 20 in the professor's picks . Our expert did slightly better, picking Fowler and runner-up Charles Howell III, along with Reed and Bill Haas (T-13). It wasn't pretty -- our version of a 7-6 football game -- but man beats machine for the second straight week, jumping ahead on the season scoreboard.
1467	1467	10	10	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
12080	12080	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, with so much talent and Tiger at the top of this field, it’s likely many will instantly give him a hard pass. Adam Scott  We’ve seen Bubba, Casey and Gary Woodland win over the past two months — the era of bad-putting, supreme ball strikers is upon us. And Scott is the poster boy for that skill set.
4589	4589	9	10	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Past Five Champions    2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Rickie Fowler  2014 – Martin Kaymer  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Matt Kuchar    Last Year’s Top 10 Finishers      1 Jason Day -15  2 Kevin Chappell -11  T3 Justin Thomas -10  T3 Matt Kuchar -10  T3 Colt Knost -10  T3 Ken Duke -10  T7 Francesco Molinari -9  T7 Hideki Matsuyama -9  T9 Graeme McDowell -8  T9 Daniel Berger -8  T9 Alex Cejka -8  The Names  Hey, Remember Me? The Next Tier  The Bargains  – based on $100,000 salary capDustin Johnson – $19,600Rory McIlroy – $18,400Jon Rahm – $17,000Rickie Fowler – $16,900The Pick: Johnson’s price has dropped significantly since the Masters and McIlroy seems due for a PLAYERS victory, but in order to save money to enhance the bottom portion of the lineup, the pick in this group is. His rankings in SG:T2G (fourth) and scrambling (second) this season on Tour are elite, and it doesn’t hurt that he won this event in the past.Jason Day – $16,900Hideki Matsuyama – $16,900Justin Thomas – $16,500Henrik Stenson – $16,200The Pick: Everyone in this group could conceivably be listed in “The Names” category, as they all have notable victories and elite potential.
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
4162	4162	53	54	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Similarly, Brendan Steele and Keegan Bradley are two pals with course form, they too have combined to win the FT Shootout, and their putting issues aren’t too much of a worry here. Clearly, there are options galore at bigger prices but I’ll return towards the top of the market where Justin Thomas and Bud Cauley get the vote at 22/1. Cauley frustrated his backers – of whom few are more loyal than me – with a stop-start T10 last week, but that’s back-to-back top-10 finishes from a seriously-talented player whose career is firmly back on track.
8483	8483	68	68	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Oosthuizen completed a career grand slam of runner-up finishes in the majors as he shared second with Reed at Quail Hollow, and that's further proof of how big-time he is despite so often proving frustrating. Indeed, his other runner-up finish this year came at the PLAYERS Championship, so while it's 18 months since he last won and seven years since his sole success at the very highest level, Oosthuizen has continued to be a factor in elite company. That much is demonstrated by his record in the FedEx Cup Playoffs.
13505	13505	20	20	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Suri nearly won his group in the WGC-Matchplay at Austin Country Club, but he finished behind eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Suri was the only one of seven opponents that Bubba didn’t destroy, as he was able to halve his match. A week later, Suri entered the Houston Open and finished eighth with three rounds in the 60s.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
65	65	13	14	target: Bill Haas’ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8k-9.9k range  This is the range where there looks to be multiple options. Bill Haas’ course form in recent years is bettered only by Simpson. In his last four starts at this course he has finished 6-2-20-7.
8002	8002	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Selections  Back Rickie Fowler each-way at 18/1 (eight places) Rickie gets the nod but the stats are certainly with anyone backing Matsuyama also. He's also got good course form with T11 on his last visit but Fowler's previous win at Quail Hollow suggests he's the most powerful stats fit.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
13683	13683	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
13188	13188	22	23	target: Brian Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out.
6087	6087	26	26	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey has two top-20 finishes at TPC River Highlands in the past two years, including a second-place finish in 2015 when he lost in a playoff. Casey’s 67.9 Course Adjusted Round Score ranks first among golfers with more than one start at this track. Moreover, Casey has been playing well lately: Prior to his 26th-place finish at the U.S. Open, Casey had finished 12th or better in three of four tournaments and hadn’t finished worse than 22nd.
1102	1102	11	12	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And this week, he gets the job done. Taras Pitra -- Roberto Castro ($8,200)  Castro has had a really good 2016 season and hasn't missed a cut in about four months. Many will look at his finishing position and price and go elsewhere, but I don't think that's a wise move this week.
7145	7145	71	71	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This time, he comes to the Open with links preparation in the bag courtesy of a top-15 finish in the Irish Open and as one of the most reliable drivers in world golf, there's every hope that he can keep out of trouble and allow his deadly iron play to pick apart the golf course. As with every player in the field, there is a negative and that's his putting, but Matsuyama can get away with an average week in that regard if at his best from tee-to-green. Five major top-10s in limited opportunities demonstrate that he's on the brink of a breakthrough and it could well come here.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
9753	9753	26	27	target: Chez Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although he is not really considered salary relief, Ryan should find a way into your lineup as he offers a very high ceiling this week. Notables  Chez Reavie – Ranks 3rd in 400-450 Scoring, 4th in Bogey Avoidance, and 13th in Scrambling. T8 here last year.
4303	4303	21	22	target: Bud Cauley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With those injury doubts, I'm willing to let him go there. The other player with a hat-trick of top 10s is Bud Cauley. Okay, they're of a different variety and one was even in a pairs event last week when he finished T5 alongside Justin Thomas in New Orleans.
11640	11640	18	19	target: Kevin Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament. A justifiable concern.
5787	5787	27	27	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His odds have been cut after his form in Scotland but the veteran still looks a dangerous outsider at 66/1 to challenge for the Claret Jug. Alex Noren has surged up the world rankings over the last year with a brilliant run of five victories since last summer. The Swede landed the BMW PGA Championship in May at Wentworth with a stunning final round of 62.
5617	5617	34	34	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s not as long off the tee as some of the bigger names (only 295 yards on average), but he hits the fairway consistently. Sitting 7th in Ball-Striking (combination of Total Driving and GIR), Casey has been great on Approach (3rd in SG:App), although a little lacking outside 200 yards which could mean some trouble. Between 150-17 and 175-200 however, Casey is 9th and 4th respectively and overall ranks 23rd in Proximity to the Hole which has helped him find 70.68% of Greens in Regulation.
779	779	18	19	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players that have good recent form over the last three or four events tend to go well here. Ryan Moore 18/1  Local Ryan Moore has had a fairly steady start to the season with a T17 at The CIMB Classic in Malaysia and a T23 at The WGC HSBC Champions last week which would have been a lot better if it weren’t for a final round 75. He had a great week in Hazeltine winning two points from three for his US team.
10697	10697	1	1	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chesson Hadley 45/1  I like the look of the in-form Chesson Hadley on a course he has expressed his liking for in the past. Hadley has been playing well over the last couple of months with four top 5’s and a top 25 in his last eight starts. He began the season in style with a T3 at the Safeway Open, a solo second at the Sanderson Farms which included four rounds of 70 or better and a T4 at the Shriners Open in Vegas, which included a 65,68,69 over the weekend to post eight under par for the tournament.
553	553	1	1	target: Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth. Look, if he didn’t have to compare his season to the monster one he put together a year ago, Spieth would be just fine. He’s won twice and has eight top 10s.
12660	12660	30	30	target: Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sure, making two of his past six cuts isn’t all that great, but he finally got all his irons clicking again in Orlando, gaining a tournament-high eight strokes on approaches. Hoge ranks tops in the field in proximity from beyond 200 yards over the past 24 rounds and 10th from 175-200 yards. Of course, like most players on this list, his weekend status will rest on his flat stick.
1346	1346	5	5	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us. His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s.
684	684	8	9	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Matt Kuchar  Vegas Odds - 15/1  Draftkings - $11,500  FantasyAces - $6,000  Kuch went a second straight season without a win but recorded 11 Top 10's, his third highest total of his career. He once again proved to be one of the most consistent talents we have on Tour missing just two cuts in 26 events.
272	272	0	0	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			List is min salary with a pretty good upside this week. Has good finishes here too.
2849	2849	21	21	target: Hadwin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,800) Hadwin doesn’t have the prettiest track record here, making 1/2 cuts with a 71st in 2015, but there is no way he should be this cheap with the way he has played this season. After missing the cut at The Safeway Open to start the season back in October, he hasn’t looked back making eight straight cuts, with four top 25s, two top tens, and a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
4101	4101	23	24	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last eight starts, his WORST finish is T-13, and he has won here. And we give you Adam Hadwin (ballstriker) and Luke Donald, who only played here once, but was T-13 and showed some good form last week. Charley Hoffman, who is money at this event.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
5151	5151	53	54	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Situated on the outskirts of Jack’s hometown Columbus, the par-72 layout is best described as long but forgiving off the tee with plenty of short-game challenge around the greens. Despite Rory McIlroy’s withdrawal from the event Monday, the 120-player field will showcase six of the world’s top 10 including Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, and 2014 champion Hideki Matsuyama. As the highest purse behind only the four majors, THE PLAYERS, and the four WGC events, there’s plenty to get excited about in Columbus this week.
620	620	65	66	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.
4166	4166	54	54	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau is coached by Daniel Summerhays’ brother and they rate an interesting team at 50/1 – they’re another twosome with very different skills and perhaps the consistency of Summerhays will work nicely with Finau’s undoubted scoring prowess. However, at similar odds and with similar make-ups I much prefer the course credentials of Luke Donald and Jamie Lovemark. Donald loves a Dye layout, even if he must be growing fed up of finishing second at Harbour Town, and he was inside the top 10 on both visits here in 2011 and 2012.
11451	11451	4	4	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A better case for Finau is his skill set and recent form. One of the PGA Tour’s premier bombers, Finau actually has been better with his irons and short game lately. In his past five starts, he’s gaining an average of three strokes per tournament with approaches, and he has only bled strokes to the field around the greens in one of his past seven measured events.
44	44	17	17	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Barclays:4 win D Johnson(10), 1ew Oosthuizen (60), 1ew Horschel (100), 1ew Matsuyama (30), 0.5ew Woodland (125)
3637	3637	26	26	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has twice been inside the top five of the Open including at Hoylake in 2014 – a course which is a short distance from Birkdale. Fowler is third for strokes gained putting this season and first for scoring average on the PGA Tour. This looks another huge opportunity for Fowler to join the growing list of first-time major champions and should be backed even though generous odds of 33/1 are long gone.
2506	2506	36	37	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has had success in past WGC events as well as he was runner-up to Rory McIlory in the match-play event in 2015. Other: Paul Casey (first in strokes gained: tee to green last week)  Value Picks  Martin Kaymer ($7,500): Kaymer was great last week and now his price has come down past some people he was priced in front of last week in a weaker field. He hasn’t missed a cut in over a year which may not matter much since there’s no cut this week, but it speaks to his consistency which is unmatched at the moment.
5628	5628	42	42	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance. What makes Scott an elite golfer and always in contention is his game on the way to the greens, as he’s a longer hitter off the tee with an average drive of 302, and hits good drives 84.4% of the time.
7992	7992	4	4	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka must be licking his lips when it comes to Quail Hollow. Aggressive (3rd in Going for the Green) and potent on the par-5s (2nd in par-5 Birdie or Better), Koepka won at Erin Hills which played pretty-much to a PGA Championship format back in June. 5th at Whistling Straits in 2015 and 4th at Baltusrol last year summarise perfectly that Koepka's power-packed game is ideal for the PGA of America's premier title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
5841	5841	15	16	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, he only has one top 10 in the last five years in this event. Adam Scott – Played the weekend in his last five including finishes of T-9, T-4 and T-18 last year at Oakmont. There aren’t many better in the GIR department, and that’s why the Aussie continues to collect big checks most weeks he tees it up.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
5724	5724	24	25	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm is a serious talent and its only a matter of time before he wins not one, but multiple major championships in the future. Thomas Pieters 40/1  Pieters has had a good season so far and could be another player that could suit a long, tricky test like Erin Hills. He played well at the Dubai Desert Classic back in February finishing T23 and followed that with a T5 at the WGC Mexico Championship and a T4 in Augusta, which included two 68’s.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
11643	11643	15	15	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ride the wave of hot irons, and hope the short game falls into place. Cameron Smith  After an amazing run in Australia late last year, Smith came into 2018 with a ton of hype. People even were putting him in the conversation to win at both events in Hawaii.
3950	3950	21	22	target: Greg Owen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like Steele, Finau has had some weight behind him this week in the DFS community and will be fairly highly owned. Greg Owen ($6400): Although he’s been around since before the Earth was formed (turned pro in 1992), Greg Owen has been fantastic in every sense of the word this year in getting from tee to green. He’s T14 in Total Driving, has been absolutely nails in finding greens (73.06%, 8th on Tour), and has an outstanding birdie average of 4.25.
11925	11925	42	42	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However thrilling it was to see Tiger in contention, he didn't quite win and while I don't hold that against him, we are talking about a different player and a different sport now. When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite.
10660	10660	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form, course form and motivation could be converging nicely. RESULT: T35  Matt Kuchar 1.25pts EW 40/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places EW, 1/5):  I also like Matt Kuchar this week on a course where he's finished 6th across both the National Pro-Am and the 2010 U.S. Open. Yes he doesn't win enough, but a 40/1 shot this week has a little juice within it and as Gary Woodland proved last week, short-term momentum can sometimes get these kind of players over the line.
747	747	10	10	target: Rose/Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chasing another achievable double this week with Frittelli (45/1) into Rose/Stenson (7/1). Those prices won't last
3766	3766	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
1634	1634	20	21	target: Sam Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What price does T26 in 4 straight tourneys get you on DK? $7,100 is gonna cause some serious ownership on Sam Saunders this week for sure.
11967	11967	31	32	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman ranked 2nd in Strokes Gained: Putting in Mexico, but just 31st in Par 5 Performance, so should he improve on the long holes here, he should be bang in contention. Adam Scott 40/1 (UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Adam Scott has made a strong return to form during the Florida Swing, after struggling for much of last season and the start of this one, so he will hope that can continue that here at Bay Hill this week. The Australian had a strong record here, before missing the cut in 2006 and 2009 and a lenghty absence from 2010-2013.
8660	8660	8	8	target: Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required. An undoubted talent, Na might not trouble the winner's interviewer nearly enough, but at 64th in the OWGR and 40th in the FedEx Cup series, the Las Vegas man will be gunning for a top 5 finish this week to grab a coveted East Lake spot. He has previous with this back in 2015 when he travelled to Chicago in 34th spot in the FEC standings.
8420	8420	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think he has a real chance this week to win and cement his Presidents Cup spot. RESULT: T17  Zach Johnson 1pt EW 70/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Zach Johnson is another who I like this week. 42nd in the FedEx Cup standings and as lowly as 28th in the Presidents Cup standings, Johnson will want to perform at Glen Oaks this week to continue the end-of-season momentum he's generated across recent up-state appearances.
10288	10288	6	7	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH: Is it smart to fade Jon Rahm this week? The Cheat Sheet provides fantasy golf players with course info, golfer history and the most noteworthy trends of the week to help them with their roster selections. The Field  The field this week is 150+ golfers.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
6210	6210	14	15	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are getting firmer and faster and the rough’s not getting any shorter." David Lingmerth : "I was really calm all day. You've really got to golf your ball out here.
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
5763	5763	3	3	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You decide! Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course. It's no wonder he has a stellar track record in major championships.
1247	1247	0	1	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
3316	3316	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t overthink Rahm GOAT this week. Rickie Fowler ($10,000) – Rickie is a different player in 2017. He is bringing it week to week and his stats backing it up.
11697	11697	9	9	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now when it comes to the longer holes (200-225) Hadley is not as impressive, ranking 60th and averaging a touch over-par, but most will here this week anyway so that doesn’t put me off too much. Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past. At 110/1 or even 100/1 it is worth chancing that Hadley can return to the form he was showing, prior to his missed cut at the Honda, which had seen him post four top-5’s already this season, one of which was as recently as the Phoenix Open (three starts ago).
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
1299	1299	80	80	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Cameron Smith; 3) Marc Leishman; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Wesley Bryan; 7) Ollie Schniederjans; 8) Daniel Berger / Zach Johnson; 10) Kyle Stanley; 11) Chris Stroud; 12) Kevin Na / Peter Uihlein; 14) Brian Gay; 15) Luke Donald; 16) Tony Finau / Ben Martin; 18) Russell Henley / Chez Reavie; 20) Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices : 2017: Justin Thomas 14/1 ; 2016: Gomez 100/1 ; 2015: Walker 18/1 ; 2014: Walker 40/1 ; 2013: Henley 100/1 ; 2012: Wagner 125/1 ; 2011: Wilson 80/1 ; 2010: Palmer 250/1 ;. Average: 91/1.
106	106	1	1	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson for one is also hard to ignore at $9,100. Watson has not been at his best this season, but has still not missed a cut and managed to finish 8th in Rio on his last start. He also finished 10th here in 2012 and 18th at the 2009 U.S. Open.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
3099	3099	15	16	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA Tour Fantasy Golf DraftKings Picks – The Puerto Rico Open  Lock of the week:  Luke List $9,900 – Luke is in solid form coming off his T17 at the API. He’s played this event twice without a missed cut, including a T15 last year. We’ve heard from sources on site that the rough is basically non existent.
5971	5971	20	21	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, we head to TPC River Highlands for the Travelers Championship. This year’s field has a few headliners in Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, and Rory McIlroy, but is fairly weak after the top 20-25 players. Last year, the Travelers was held after the PGA Championship, but it’s been bumped up in the ever-changing schedule.
4307	4307	31	31	target: Simpson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may be wise not to overthink it so I'm looking for a player with a strong record in NC which includes big finishes at the Wells Fargo. Step forward Webb Simpson. Back in 2011, I had a 20/1 'win only' punt on Simpson landing the Wyndham Championship and he obliged, shooting 66-65-64-67 to secure his maiden PGA Tour title.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
7211	7211	2	3	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70. Sounds a bit like TPC River Highlands, where he just won.
8709	8709	47	47	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The T5 came in the US Open, the T20 in the Open Championship, the T13 in the WGC-Bridgestone and the T17 in The Northern Trust. Any ideas that his top five in the US Open was a one-week-only tale of little guy did good is simply wrong; Schauffele keeps going up against the world's best and performing with credit. His excellent effort at Erin Hills in the year's second major was the turning point though.
1021	1021	24	25	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After tying for 66th in his Sea Island debut, has missed the cut in four consecutive starts. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
8461	8461	7	8	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recommended bets: The Northern Trust 1pt e.w. Patrick Reed at 40/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - defending champion is close to another win after best major finish 1pt e.w. Louis Oosthuizen at 45/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - superbly consistent Playoff record and arrives after T2 in the PGA 1pt e.w.
11495	11495	1	1	target: Pieters, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week. Xander Schauffele, $8800 – Probably the best value of the week, Schauffele will get his first look at Club de Golf Chapultepec in competition.
8836	8836	7	7	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, at 25th in the standings Garcia is in exactly the same position from which Bill Haas scooped the lot with that famous shot out of the lake in 2011. All things considered, Garcia looks a solid alternative to the more fancied runners after controversially sneaking into the field on Sunday night to earn a return to a course which plays to his strengths. Video element not supported Sergio's rocky road to saving par at BMW
12241	12241	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
167	167	10	10	target: Fathauer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
6554	6554	4	4	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greenbrier Classic Picks! Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9100 FD: $8900  All season watching Finau play I have been waiting for the inevitable breakout win and where better than this weak field. Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory.
172	172	6	6	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranked No. 1 in the world, Day should also benefit from a three-week break following his runner-up finish at the PGA Championship. David Jayne -- Keegan Bradley ($7,600)  Bradley is in solid form coming in with six consecutive made cuts with three top-25 finishes, and needs to play well to improve his current 106th place standing in the FedEx Cup.
2594	2594	41	41	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played well at the OHL Classic at the starts of the season finishing solo second and followed that with a T6 at The Sony Open in Hawaii and a T20 at The Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines. Most recently Woodland had a super performance at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am shooting 67,65 over the weekend to finish T5 on 12 under. He followed that with another solid performance last week at The Honda shooting rounds of 71,66,66,69 to finish eight under and T2 for the tournament.
2533	2533	46	47	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price. Finally, I want to side with Kevin Na in some way and the top-five and top-10 markets look best. In essence, Na is another accurate type, with form at altitude and at some of the PGA Tour’s tighter courses, such as Harbour Town and Silverado.
2073	2073	10	10	target: Johnson/Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into the picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama ($11,500/$11,400) – Look, I understand Jordan Spieth played out of his dome last week, and I have no doubt he could ship this week too. But to put DJ and Hideki at $1,100 and $1,200 below him this week is simply blasphemous.
7957	7957	77	77	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This preview will look at all those available for the official European Tour fantasy game. Open champion Jordan Spieth is amongst a raft of players, writers, oddsmakers and gamers to have pencilled in the Northern Irishman as the man to beat this week and McIlroy is likely to form the bedrock of most fantasy teams. The North Carolina track has staged the regular-season Wells Fargo Championship (previously Quail Hollow Championship and Wachovia Championship) on 13 occasions and Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015.
13299	13299	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he is priced as the 11th– most expensive player on DK, DailyRoto gives Hatton the fourth-best win probability (2.66%). Putting and short game are going to be a huge factor this week and Hatton is fifth in SG Putting and fourth in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green. This is a steal at just $8,800.
7301	7301	13	13	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am willing to go with the field on this one and play Harman within my lineups. Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week.
1051	1051	14	14	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Few darts on the machine this week for the #SentryTournamentofChampions Kisner 42.0 Berger 65.0 Kim 170.0

4517	4517	31	31	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 17 starts, Sergio has missed the cut twice! If there's one guy who could be called the horse for this course, it would be Sergio Garcia.. -- Michael Collins  Rickie Fowler  In 2015, Fowler played world-class golf down the closing stretch at TPC Sawgrass to win the Players Championship and plant his flag in the fairway as a world class player, following the "overrated" narrative that started in the media. Now a year removed from the hype of repeating, Fowler has the game to win again at the newly renovated course.

2706	2706	1	1	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
10095	10095	0	1	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton Kizzire already has two wins this season including last week’s win at the Sony Open. Kizzire’s confidence is sky high and the field is one that shouldn’t daunt him. He sits in the top quarter on Tour in all the key stats for the week (strokes gained: approach, Par 5 scoring, birdie or better %), and is now using these events to get ready for The Masters.
7016	7016	42	43	target: Scott Brown, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round.
10610	10610	37	38	target: Vaughn Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All the time Kirk is three-figures he is worth keeping an eye on in current form, and given his play here in 2013 I thought this could be another chance for him to finish inside the top-5. Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts.
1882	1882	11	11	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick to Click: 4 guys above 10k this week. I’m picking Spieth to win until he wins. So, he’s gonna win this week.
3394	3394	15	15	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts. With Adam, you can always take that his long game is going to be good, so for me, and I don’t know what the betting is, but if there’s value in the price of Adam Scott, that’s who I’d go with.
13321	13321	87	87	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As luck would have it though his next start happens to be at a venue he has had some good success at in the past in the form of the Oaks Course. Horschel has played this event for the past seven consecutive years and it has been a somewhat bizarre case of ‘feast or famine’ for him with three top four finishes, two missed cuts and a 74th & 75th place finish to his name! Interestingly Hilton Head has never been a particularly happy hunting ground for Billy and on only one occasion has he arrived in San Antonio on the back of a top 10 finish at Harbour Town and he went on to finish 3rd that week.
3994	3994	4	5	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year.
834	834	27	27	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fact the greens are large this week will help negate his relatively poor chipping as a large percentage of greens will be hit by the field. Molinari can thrive on any course where proximity to the hole is paramount and that can be seen by his last two appearances at TPC Sawgrass where he finished 7th and 6th in elite company. As you would expect for one of the straightest drivers in the game, only Stenson sits above him in driving accuracy for the European Tour season.
1123	1123	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler- 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(60th and 51st in his last two starts) However, he’s placed well both times here in the Bahamas so I expect that to continue. Rickie Fowler- $7,900 Returning to the form reminiscent of what we saw two seasons ago, Fowler’s game is headed in the right direction. Two good showings both times here in the Bahamas and at $7900 I like a top 5 in his future.
5212	5212	53	53	target: Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $10,000  The last time we saw Hideki, he finished T22 at The PLAYERS and it seems as though the buzz around Hideki has gone away. Obviously he isn’t the hottest golfer on the planet anymore like he was late in 2016, but he certainly shouldn’t be priced $1,000 less that Spieth. Matsuyama won this event in 2014 and game T5 in 2015 and we are all well aware of his capabilities tee to green.
1815	1815	5	5	target: Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
5159	5159	25	26	target: Billy Horschel, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, he’s done just that the last two years, posting 8-under and 9-under on the par-5s respectively, leading to finishes of T11 and T8. Billy Horschel, $7100 – Recent Byron Nelson champ has two top-15s at Muirfield in three career starts, showcasing a nice blend of recent form and course history. Patrick Cantlay, $6600 – The youngster from UCLA earned his PGA Tour status with a runner-up at the Valspar in March and has gone on to post three top-25s in four starts since.
778	778	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
11892	11892	33	33	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The World Number 5 is in a rich vein of form and he continued that last week with 5th place at Copperhead. Despite grabbing the lead at the start of the final round, Rose struggled on Sunday, but if there's one thing we have learnt about the Englishman, it's to keep faith with him when he's playing well. Going back to 2012, here are Rose's performances in the tournament prior to the win: 5th, 8th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 22nd, 10th, 1st, 10th.
6544	6544	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
6823	6823	14	14	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Stankowski recorded that remarkable achievement in late March and early April of 1996. Hadley can join him at the John Deere Classic where he gained entry as an alternate via Past Champion status. With his path back to the big leagues secure after prevailing at the LECOM Health Challenge on Sunday (to rise to fourth in Web.com earnings), the PGA TOUR's 2013-14 Rookie of the Year was able to accept the spot in the field at TPC Deere Run.
8953	8953	14	15	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2014, Moore successfully defended the title he first won in 2013. Last year, Justin Thomas made it two double wins in a row in the CIMB Classic. He won in 2015 and 2016.
11175	11175	26	26	target: Hatton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After winning the Masters last year, Sergio appears to be a much more relaxed player who is more likely to raise a trophy come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton, $10600 – A European Tour staple, Hatton will make his first PGA Tour start this season at the course he finished fourth at last year. Hatton is a great putter who recently finished third at the Dubai Desert Classic, making him worth strong consideration this week.
3769	3769	13	14	target: Chad Campbell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Please! Make the cut  Luke List $7,300  Lucas Glover $7,200  Kyle Stanley $7,200  Chad Campbell $7,100  I really don’t think you must dip below $7,000 this week, but of course you can if you choose. I probably won’t.
2915	2915	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Sean O’Hair, Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Rory McIlroy, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Paul Casey, Thomas Pieters, Tony Finau, Russell Henley, Tyrell Hatton, Marc Leishman  – Anirban Lahari, David Lingmerth, Graeme McDowell, Kevin Kisner, Francesco Molinari, Sean O’Hair, Bud Cauley  Bets:  Thomas Pieters 33-1  Paul Casey 33-1  Marc Leishman 100-1  Russell Henley 66-1 Led the field in birdies last week at the Euro Tour event in India. Lahari is fourth in Birdie or Better percentage in 2017 and posted a solid 11th at the Honda Classic three weeks ago.
368	368	7	7	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @wesleybryangolf at 50/1 in the @ValsparChamp. Bryan loves the Florida greens and has finished fourth in his last two tournaments
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
11475	11475	26	27	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
12097	12097	14	14	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He came T7 here last season after his T17 finish in his debut. Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds.
4208	4208	26	27	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s the inaugural version of this event, so not much to talk about in the way of past winners. The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner.
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
8081	8081	12	12	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The next piece of the puzzle is his form at Quail Hollow. Chappell has been a regular there and in two of the last three years he's made an impression with T11 in 2014 and T16 in 2015. Last year he opened with a 67 before fading.
11468	11468	3	3	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous. Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship to close 2017 on the Euro Tour, then opened 2018 by taking the CareerBuilder.
6096	6096	25	26	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Par 4 Scoring, Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:App), Approaches 150-175 Yards, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G)  Top-Tier Plays  Patrick Reed ($9,300)  The American Ryder Cup star, dubbed the "American Eagle" by many, is back on the right track after losing it for a little bit. From Week 7 to Week 16 (six events), Reed had three missed cuts and did not finish better than 38th. He has turned that around, finishing in the top 20 three times in his last five starts and also posting a 22nd in that span.
3958	3958	33	34	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take him each-way at 50/1 to follow in the footsteps of Wesley Bryan and secure a first PGA Tour win. At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s.
4984	4984	40	41	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
1477	1477	13	13	target: Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut. 12 months on from a switch to PXG, Zach has established what seems a comfortable relationship with his clubs, and the putter really clicked at Waialae last week.
577	577	4	4	target: Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Scott, Casey, Oosthuizen, Koepka &amp; Haas in #TheMasters. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
2223	2223	26	27	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has three top 10s and two missed cuts in a feast-or-famine season thus far, but we expect him to cash a nice check this week. Brooks Koepka ($7,100)  He's never played Riviera as a pro, but we're expecting big things out of Koepka in 2017, and this would be a good week for him to start delivering. Jim Furyk ($6,700)  Still shaking the rust off, but he's finished in the top 25 at Riviera in four straight appearances, including an eighth-place showing in 2015.
5196	5196	35	35	target: Kuchar’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar has finished outside the top 15 just once in seven trips here since 2009, with a win and three additional top-five finishes — including a fourth-place finish last year — during that stretch. Unsurprisingly, Kuchar’s 67.2 Course Adj Rd Score leads the field this week. Kuchar’s LT Adj Bird Avg (13.7), LT GIR percentage (67.3), and LT SC percentage (60.4) all rank inside the top 25 of this field.
7479	7479	3	4	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Open’s runner-up, Matt Kuchar, is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Kuchar has finished inside the top-10 here in each of the past three years the Canadian Open has been played at Glen Abbey: His 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks second in this week’s field. But it’s not just Kuchar’s course history that’s hot like fiya: Kuchar’s 67.4 Recent Adj Rd Score leads the field, thanks in part to six straight finishes of 16th or better, including three finishes of fourth or better.
497	497	2	2	target: Phil 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Welp guess Phil and PU may be my highest owned this week. With Rickie.
626	626	0	1	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zac Blair at $6500 is like stealing. Great Par 4 scorer.Driving accuracy, bogey avoidance and scrambling rank top 10 on tour.8th two wks ago
2601	2601	2	2	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
4643	4643	35	35	target: Blair, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			John Huh ($6500): Another cheap option that could find some success and a top-25 finish, John Huh makes an excellent option for those looking for salary relief. He’s built much the same way as Zac Blair, in that he’s excellent and scrambling (4th), and avoiding bogeys (12th), but lacks distance off the tee (average of 287.8 yards). Again like Blair, John Huh is also very accurate off the tee, and this is a course where a lack of distance won’t hurt and it’s a key to put the ball at the right yardage.
8179	8179	42	43	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is a correlation between the Bridgestone and the PGA: Every PGA winner since 2007 had been at least T22 at the Bridgestone. Take that for what it's worth, and most of the usual suspects to win this week -- Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Hideki Matsuyama -- were in the top-22 at Firestone. Weather-wise, there was some rain during practice rounds.
2599	2599	15	15	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like Mickelson, he's a lot of golfer for $7,500. And averaging 3.75 birdies per round, Kaymer can fill it up. Definitely the biggest upside of anyone in the $7,400-$7,500 range.

5686	5686	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Dufner 2 weeks ago and Bello last week recency bias is real and he could be that guy this week after his missed cut at the St. Jude, which I’m not worried about at all. Middle Range  Paul Casey $8,400 – He currently sits as the second highest rated golfer in my model. Knock on wood he hasn’t missed a cut since I mushed him with my One and Done pick in Hawaii.
5107	5107	11	11	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I really thought I could have got to that magic number." Scott looks a danger on any suitable course right now and this must count as one of them. Take the 25s.
8403	8403	25	25	target: Moore, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore bounced back with a 69 on the Sunday and finished a very respectable T13. Again last week it was one bad round that cost Moore, with a final round 70 which saw him fall short at the Wyndham Championship, finishing T24. Opening with rounds of 67-65-68 last week suggests he’s showing some form and should the putter get warm this week, he can contend at a course similar to those he’s enjoyed in the past.
12079	12079	46	46	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of the field will shy away from challenging the water, however, and that leads to a lot of long irons. Over 33 percent of approach shots come from beyond 200 yards, so it’s no surprise that players such as Tiger, Stenson, Rose, Keegan, Rory and Scott all have experienced success at this event over the years. Quality long irons will help mitigate the difficulty of the long Par 3s (three over 200 yards), the lengthier Par 4s (six over 450 yards), make the Par 5s slightly easier, and potentially open up an eagle opportunity on the 16th hole.
8026	8026	64	64	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is still hard at this point to predict the winning score this week, given the series of changes made to the course but he has had the goods here in the past and the majority of the course will be the same as it has been in the past. A 4th here last year suggests the change to Bermuda greens did not bother Fowler, and I struggle to see this week panning out without him involved over the weekend. With Matsuyama, McIlroy and Spieth looking so strong, it is hard for anyone to topple them but Fowler is one player that is certainly capable of doing just that.
7046	7046	37	38	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High dunes provide great vantage points for spectators of what is widely regarded as one of the truest tests of links golf. It's a tough but fair links and when the wind blows it's a brute - Padraig Harrington won the last renewal staged here in three-over-par! Only the par five 17th hole averaged below par and that's the only time this century that the tournament has been won with an over-par total.
533	533	10	10	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a week for speculative plays in Houston: Reifers 200/1, Cauley 200/1, Flores 225/1, Castro 250/1, Stefani 275/1.
11478	11478	22	22	target: Luiten 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My main fancy in Mexico is a fairly speculative one on first look but yet given he won his last tournament, Joost Luiten perhaps shouldn’t be the outsider that the market makes him at 125/1*. Luiten was last seen getting the better of Ryder Cup player Chris Wood in Oman two weeks ago and unusually he putted very well. It is normally tee-to-green supremacy that we associate with Luiten and it was that part of his game that was on show at Chapultepec last year as he ranked 1st in drving accuracy and 1st in GIR.
218	218	6	6	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Reed, Knox &amp; Simpson in Phoenix this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
1687	1687	2	2	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt Lucas Glover top-20 finish at 9/2 BetVictor Glover is still a dicey win proposition because I’m not sure his putting can stand-up to the pressure but his ball-striking alone can get him a top-20 finish. The story seems to be repeating itself in the 2016-17 season but he went close at both the Sanderson Farms Championship and the Shriners.
1014	1014	3	3	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Kevin Chappell and Charles Howell III. Chappell had a breakout campaign last season and that included a runner-up finish at Sea Island. Howell, who was T-9 here last year, is perfect example of course form meets current form.
5014	5014	0	1	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
3874	3874	10	10	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Brendan Steele & Branden Grace – On the heels of an impressive Sunday at The Heritage, Grace seems to have finally righted his game. As will be the theme with many of the picks this week, the South African dominates off the tee and with his irons, but is lost on the greens.
3026	3026	19	19	target: Cejka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The winner typically finishes in the mid to upper teens under par in ideal conditions. Back in 2015 Alex Cejka finished -7 when the wind was howling as compared to Chesson Hadley coming in at -21 back in 2014. Since the tournament usually features plenty of scoring, we are going to target players with a strong Birdie or Better %.
10569	10569	14	15	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he’s playing well again and was T-12 at Farmers last week. Also like: Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
4447	4447	60	60	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A third round 75 here last year in some very windy conditions ultimately proved his undoing but he battled back on the final day (65) to finish in a tie for third and has excellent claims to improve on that further. He is ranked 12th since 2014 for Strokes Gained on Dye-designed courses if you are a stats boffin and Thomas can confirm he really is among the elite with victory here. Jon Rahm continues to tackle every challenge with some gusto and it doesn’t seem to bother him what venue is in front of him ahead of his Sawgrass debut.
7246	7246	22	23	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I prefer him at 25/1 than out-of-form Rory McIlroy and inexperienced Jon Rahm at 18s. Justin Rose and massively in-form local hero Tommy Fleetwood both have obvious links to Royal Birkdale and should go well at 25/1 and 18s respectively. A bit further down, I like Adam Scott and Branden Grace too.
7087	7087	54	55	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps it’s a big the reason why Royal Birkdale has produced so many classy winners. By country it reads five Americans - Arnold Palmer (1961), Lee Trevino (1971), Johnny Miller (1976), Tom Watson (1983) and Mark O'Meara (1998), three Australians - Peter Thomson (1954 & 1965) and Ian Baker-Finch (1991) and one Irishman - Padraig Harrington (2008). Every winner since the world rankings became a thing was a top 25 player; every winner before they existed would probably have been in the top 10.
3223	3223	54	55	target: Phil Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, the Rees Jones design is a par 72 that measures 7,441 yards, which will provide a stern test to all of those teeing it up this week. There are a number of big names in the field this week working on eleventh hour tune-ups for Augusta, including Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Phil Mickelson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Adam Scott and many others. I took last week off from my column (#sorrynotsorry Puerto Rico Open and WGC Match Play), but two weeks ago my picks at the Arnold Palmer Invitational were straight nails as my Driver-off-the-Deck BOLD play of the week on Marc Leishman took home the trophy.
38	38	0	1	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Day is now the betting favorite to win his second major championship according to the recent Las Vegas betting line that came out on Monday. Day, the defending PGA Champion after his three-shot victory over Jordan Spieth at Whistling Straits last August, has had a solid 2016 season with three wins that include the Arnold Palmer Invitational, WGC-Dell Match Play and the Players Championship against a major-type field. According to Westgate LV Superbook, at 13-2, Day is a slight favorite over 2011 U.S. Open winner Rory McIlroy, who is at 7-1 and followed closely behind by Jordan Spieth at 15-2.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
11974	11974	16	17	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I do not hate the idea of a Day-Noren playoff for the second time this year. Henrik Stenson ($9100) – People will most likely be off of him due to his poor performance last week. It hopefully will not take much to be overweight on Stenson and he has great history (minus last year).
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6207	6207	56	75	target: David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Boo Weekley; 3) Ben Crane; 3) Spencer Levin; 4) Tim Wilkinson; 5) Kyle Stanley; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Jim Herman / Daniel Summerhays; 9) David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Johnson Wagner; 18) Martin Laird / Kyle Reifers; 20) K.J. Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor.
1015	1015	5	5	target: Bryson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Final card, E/W Henley 40/1 Bryson 66/1 Kim 70/1 Bryan 125/1 Shop around, those aren’t all the best numbers. Long… https://t.co/FBeLPhLDGD
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
9977	9977	0	1	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley is coming off two Top 10's in the fall and Webb Simpson is coming off his best finish(T4 at the Sony Open) since the Wyndham in August. All three will be popular this week and I will have a ton of exposure to Cauley and Reavie in cash games but feel there are some projected lower owned players in this range to help us separate ourselves in GPP formats. The first player I will be targeting is Chesson Hadley who I wrote up above.
11696	11696	11	11	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the five Par-3’s two are 195 and 200 yards, and Hadley currently ranks 29th in Par-3 efficiency 175-200 yards. Now when it comes to the longer holes (200-225) Hadley is not as impressive, ranking 60th and averaging a touch over-par, but most will here this week anyway so that doesn’t put me off too much. Given his solid Approach and Putting figures this season, as well as ranking 16th in Proximity to the Hole, this looks a good setup for Hadley who has shown a liking for this course in the past.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
1272	1272	4	4	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
11195	11195	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's what makes Fowler doubly tough this week. DRAFTKINGS VALUE PICKS (Based on Standard $50K Salary Cap)    Tier 1 Values    Rickie Fowler - $11,700 (Winning odds at golfodds.com: 10-1)  We wrote this last year and we are able to write it again: "Fowler leads the Tour in bogey avoidance." He's also among the game's elite scramblers.
7213	7213	0	1	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garica and Louis Oosthuizen. This is a course Spieth should really like, as it’s not one to be overpowered and is a par 70. Sounds a bit like TPC River Highlands, where he just won.
100	100	18	18	target: Lindheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
730	730	4	4	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
5616	5616	27	28	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Launch Angle – any time the wind can be a major factor, golfers that shoot low angle drives won’t be as impacted by the wind. The Golfers  Paul Casey ($8400) – Paul Casey has some a great mix of Off-The-Tee numbers that could help put him in great spots at Erin Hills, and has performed well at some of the comparison courses – a T30 and T10 at Whistling Straits, T7 at Royal Birkdale, and a T39 at Chambers Bay. He has the long and low drive that’s emblematic of English and South African golfers, which is so important to succeed at links courses, and he currently sits 15th in Good Drive percentage.
5011	5011	27	27	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Among our value picks this week, Grillo is our favorite GPP tournament play, as we see low ownership and with him flying somewhat under the radar. Pat Perez $7,600 – Can someone please tell us when Mr. Perez is going to get some DraftKings pricing credit for his play? The guy is on absolute fire recently with seven straight made cuts, including five top-25 finishes in that span.
12219	12219	71	71	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This year he has been drawn in a group with his Ryder Cup buddy Jordan Spieth, Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel. As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through.
13126	13126	8	9	target: Matt Every, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - K.J. Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Fabian Gomez, Billy Horschel, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Davis Love III, Ryan Palmer, Brandt Snedeker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Graeme McDowell, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, John Senden, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Nick Watney.
309	309	3	3	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Rahm, Oosthuizen, Woodland &amp; Haas in WGC-MexicoChamp. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
8228	8228	19	19	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts. We currently have Rory projected for 21-25 percent ownership in large-field guaranteed prize pools (GPPs), but I wouldn’t be shocked to see him break 30 percent in DraftKing’s Millionaire Maker.
3729	3729	1	1	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Kisner was second to Furyk here, he put on a ball-striking clinic and a similar display should see him go close once more, his focus no doubt fixed on atoning for Bay Hill and winning on what's home soil for the South Carolina man, who practices nearby at Kiawah Island. As for going win-only, again that's largely so he can share the load with Snedeker, but I'm a big believer in Kisner's ability to get it done. He just looks a winner and even last week at the Masters said, "I'm not out here to make cuts.
2475	2475	22	22	target: Diaz 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dufner-8100 way too much when Noren’s 7200  Molinari-8200 same reason as above. Names to know, or I had to look up-  Roberto Diaz ($6,500)- Playing his way via the highest ranked Mexican golfer in the world, Diaz has been tearing up the Web.Com tour this year posting a 4/4 record with 3 top 20’s. In a no cut event for the min price playing for the pride of his country, I like the narrative here.
206	206	6	6	target: Roberto 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously with Kenny on my man Roberto at 125/1. Good driver of the ball and led the field in GIR last week. 2 top… https://t.co/nT9HCVEKVs
13249	13249	29	29	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson is one of the most talented souls on tour; just not sure that translates to dividends this week. We do like Riccio's picks of Paul Casey and Zach Johnson, two players whose games mirror past RBC Heritage winners like Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, and Graeme McDowell. Same goes for his picks of Austin Cook (although the Model seemingly chooses Cook every week) and Matt Kuchar (who's won here in the past).
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
11499	11499	131	131	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still unfamiliar to most players in the field, Club de Golf Chapultepec should again provide a solid test and limit the winner to no lower than mid-teens under par despite the highly talented field. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Dustin Johnson  2016 – Adam Scott  2015 – Dustin Johnson  2014 – Patrick Reed  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Justin Rose  2011 – Nick Watney  2010 – Ernie Els  2009 – Phil Mickelson  2008 – Geoff Ogilvy    Key Stats to Winning this Week    • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green  • Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green  • Avg Proximity to the Hole    Champion’s Profile    With just one year of history of play on the PGA Tour, Club de Golf Chapultepec was a fan favorite in it’s first go last season. Taking a close look at 2017, DJ didn’t wow off the tee like he normally does, he simply kept the ball in play and made hay with his irons.
4577	4577	32	32	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is going to be popular(2nd most tagged on FanShare at this point) this week, especially on DraftKings under the $9K mark but makes a high upside play safe in all formats. Hideki Matsuyama  World Golf Ranking (#4)  Vegas Odds (20/1)  Draftkings ($9,700)  FanDuel ($9,600)  Hideki has one more year of experience here at TPC Sawgrass but very similar form as Thomas and has also gotten better each year. Despite shooting no rounds under 70 in 2014, he was very consistent through four rounds and finished T23.
5790	5790	27	27	target: Noren, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was his first major start and considering the huge strides he has made in the last decade there is every reason to expect a stronger challenge. Noren, who tied for ninth at Royal Lytham in 2012, should be capable of surpassing this in Southport and deserves support at 50/1 each way. Marc Leishman has already established an impressive record at the Open and the Australian looks well equipped to mount another challenge this weekend.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
13197	13197	34	34	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cook won the RSM Classic, finished T18 at the Sony Open and also made the weekend at the Mayakoba (T50) after shooting an opening-round 66. All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley.
9019	9019	29	30	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Granted, there's some guesswork required but at 80/1 he looks worth sticking with. Luke List: Ready to make his mark  One year older and with a similar enough profile, Gary Woodland is next on the list having been eased out despite playing perfectly well last week. Two bogey-free rounds at TPC Kuala Lumpur is some effort - while a low-scoring track, few players manage to avoid a hiccup over even 18 holes - and he closed out encouragingly to once again show that he's comfortable in Asia.
1358	1358	21	21	target: Berger's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also ranked 30th in putting 4'-8' and 22nd in putting 15'-20'. With an emphasis on Par 4 scoring this week, Berger's rank of 14th last season should be very beneficial. He also ranked 46th in our top key stat this week: GIR.
3396	3396	44	45	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes, he’s on a streak, but he wouldn’t be my choice down to the fade. He is big and strong, which is a help, but even coming off the win, and I think he’s in a happy place, no I’d definitely be sticking with Adam Scott. Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds.
1054	1054	13	13	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
4474	4474	3	3	target: Henley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like Thomas, Henley has shown an excellent approach game this year, hitting 71.20% of his greens in regulation (14th) and is a top-60 golfer in every approach range including the ever-important 200+ yards. Henley is a stud on the greens – more specifically, Bermuda greens – and has made 37.74% of his putts between 10-15’ (25th) on his way to the 7th best Strokes Gained: Putting on Tour. Although he missed the cut here last year, Henley was T24 in 2015 and T17 in 2014, so there’s some good course history at play as well.
7887	7887	22	23	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The $9,700 price tag means we can easily fit him into lineups without having to drop too deep in the $6K range. Thomas Pieters $7,300 – Pieters is one of our GPP favorites for DraftKings this week. He’s an absolute bomber that scores birdies and eagles at an extremely high rate.
7331	7331	11	12	target: Andy Sullivan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's made the cut in four of the past five Opens. Andy Sullivan - $7,000 (100-1)    The Englishman has not had the finest of years, falling from 44th to 66th in the OWGR. But he has played better of late, making his past 10 worldwide cuts, including four-top-20s in his past five starts.
1786	1786	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So make sure you are comfortable with the stands that you take. CASH: Hideki Matsuyama is the man again this week. His course history is elite, both before and after the renovation.
6567	6567	1	1	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Danny Lee falls into the second category as a player that consistently shows form before his results. I felt given this form Lee provided cash game stability well simultaneously providing GPP upside. Lee’s performance provided both as his finished helped propel cash line-ups into the money and gave GPP lineups a solid shot at a higher payout.
6247	6247	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring. Also Consider: Bill Haas, Adam Hadwin, Bud Cauley, Kevin Na  GPP Pivots  Grayson Murray ($6,800) – I am not a fan of Grayson off the course but since we are only worried about his life in the ropes lets get to it.
3121	3121	26	26	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Par 4 Scoring has been really important here too. The first two home last year, Herman and Henrik Stenson, ranked tied second on the par fours, Holmes ranked number one for Par 4 Scoring two years ago and Spieth, who lost in the playoff, ranked second. In the last 11 years, since the event switched to this venue, ten of the 11 winners have ranked inside the top-10 for that stat and all 11 have ranked inside the top-10 for birdies made.
8682	8682	2	3	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T9  Kevin Na 0.75pt EW 70/1 with New customers: get up to £25 in free bets via this link, T&Cs apply (6 places, 1/5 odds):  With form of 6(TPC Boston)-29(Glen Oaks)-4(Sedgefield), Kevin Na is playing some nice stuff and for an each-way cover bet he's ideal this week. Finding enough greens in regulation to be competitive, Na is putting beautifully right now and that makes him a danger on a short layout where strong putting is required. An undoubted talent, Na might not trouble the winner's interviewer nearly enough, but at 64th in the OWGR and 40th in the FedEx Cup series, the Las Vegas man will be gunning for a top 5 finish this week to grab a coveted East Lake spot.
165	165	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
12812	12812	12	12	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still in the middle of his comeback after major back fusion surgery, Woods has looked like a potential winner in his recent TOUR stops. After opening 2018 with a T23 at the Farmers Insurance Open, Woods missed the cut at the Genesis Open, prompting many to suggest he needed more time to get back into the real swing of tournament action. But a 12th place finish at the Honda Classic was followed by a runner up effort at the Valspar Championship — keeping the hype alive and building.
2476	2476	9	9	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll be on at 16s. The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail.
12348	12348	4	4	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY PICK : Alex Noren ($8,700)  Noren doesn’t necessarily have the easiest opening group (Tony Finau, Thomas Pieters, Kevin Na), but the Swede has been one of the world’s best players over the past few months and owns the experience angle over his competitors. Noren has an underrated match-play record, having reached the semifinal of the Paul Laurie Match Play event in Europe in 2016 — winning five matches in a row to achieve that feat. He went 3-0 in his Austin pod last year and gave eventual winner Dustin Johnson a good run before losing out to him.
938	938	1	1	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
451	451	19	19	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gotta give an some extra time looking into Bozzelli (55/1) and Spaun (45/1). I'm intrigued. Oh, if you want List at 33/1, get him now.
6504	6504	46	47	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All six golfers in the upper tier are close in overall tags so it will be important to pay close attention as lineup lock approaches to help decide which golfers will be the most owned and which make the best GPP plays. $8K - $9K Range  Tony Finau currently leads all golfers in all ranges in total tags and start recommendations so I fully expect him to be one of the Top 3 highest owned plays this week. I talked about him above and won't let ownership sway me from using him.
9878	9878	21	22	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Almost certain to have numerous birdie chances, he is one for whom the weekend will come and they drop. Having backed Jason Dufner for this in 2016 after watching his warm-up at the Sony, I am struggling to leave him out after a similar display last week. Yes, he was a bigger price but the horse hasn’t bolted after he ran up an impressive putting stat off an unusually average approach game and must be inspired returning to the venue of the victory over David Lingmerth in a memorable play-off here two years ago..
571	571	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar went to Georgia Tech and he plays pretty well in this college hometown event. However, his form has slipped in the playoffs.
10604	10604	10	10	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While it will be his first visit to TPC Scottsdale, Noren does have the advantage of having played some desert-style courses before on the Euro Tour, which should be comparable in style. Despite only winning once last year, Noren is a golfer with good win equity as well, as he’s recorded five wins worldwide over the past 19 months and is a proven competitor when in the mix. Even though he’s $1,500 more expensive this week than last, his recent form and record over the last couple of years make him a solid play in the $9K range, where his overall career record outclasses those who surround him in price.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
5521	5521	7	8	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WilliamHill 6 places 1/5 odds) 2pts e/w:  Jordan Spieth has not had his best season so far, but the fact we are saying that is a testament to the lofty expectations placed on him by both us and himself. Before winning at Pebble Beach in February, Spieth started the season T3-3-T9, but it his play since that has raised question marks. He has missed three cuts in the nine events since his win and also failed to make it out of his group at the WGC Match Play.
2960	2960	32	33	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson is likely the player with the better floor, although Rory McIlroy has the higher win equity, and I’d lean Rory if forced to choose. Other targets here include Tyrell Hatton, Paul Casey, Thomas Pieters, Kevin Kisner and Marc Leishman  Tournaments: There is a lot of risk/reward types of plays in this field. It’s likely Jason Day will go very under-owned at the top.
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
12806	12806	2	3	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: T20  Paul Casey 2.5pts EW 22/1 with * For the latest bet365 Opening Account Offer details see below. I'm also into Paul Casey this week. I often overlook him on the basis that he doesn't win nearly enough.
9701	9701	30	30	target: Reavie’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie finished last season strong with six straight top 25’s and has shown decent course history with three straight made cuts including a top 10 last season. The course fits Reavie’s game as his lack of distance off of the tee won’t hurt him as much as it would on other layouts. According to our Research Station, Reavie is number 1 in field adjusted driving accuracy of any player priced over $9000 on FanDuel.

1185	1185	20	20	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In summary, it’s not a difficult course tee-to-green and that relieves the pressure from his long game. Twelve months ago, Spieth won by 8 shots despite gaining just 0.3 strokes per round on the field with his putting. To win by that margin with only an average putting display (by his standards) bodes well.
763	763	26	27	target: Ryan Blaum 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may be a week where you don’t need to take anyone in this range but if you do, there are a few to choose from. Ryan Blaum has taken to life on the PGA Tour well, finishing T26 and T11 in his first two events this season. He also finished T29 at the OHL Mayakoba Classic last year.
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
4955	4955	0	1	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth is the defending champion at this week’s Dean & DeLuca Invitational. Can he make it back-to-back wins in Fort Worth? The Dean & DeLuca Invitational, an event that’s sponsored by a New York-founded chain of upscale grocery stores but held in the heart of Texas, starts an interesting little run of tournaments leading to the PGA TOUR‘s second major of the season.
7325	7325	71	72	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Right now, it's hard to see an early or late advantage. Key Stats to Winning at Royal Birkdale    • Driving Accuracy/SG: Off-the-Tee  • Greens in Regulation/Strokes Gained: Approach  • Scrambling/Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green  • Bogey Avoidance    Past Champions    2016 - Henrik Stenson  2015 - Zach Johnson  2014 - Rory McIlroy  2013 - Phil Mickelson  2012 - Ernie Els  2011 - Darren Clarke  2010 - Louis Oosthuizen  2009 - Stewart Cink  2008 - Padraig Harrington  2007 - Padraig Harrington    Champion's Profile:    While driving accuracy and other on-the-course factors will be paramount in determining who will hoist the Claret Jug, it's hard to ignore these other numbers: Eight of the last 10 Open winners have been 35 or older, and five of the past six have been 39 or older. The Open is unlike any other tournament in the world.
293	293	1	1	target: @ollie_gt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @ollie_gt at 74/1 in @TheHondaClassic. Schniederjans is a big talent and the American has caught the eye with 2 top tens in last 3
9950	9950	26	26	target: Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A T39 finish last week then looks extremely positive under the circumstances and he will be pleased to get through four rounds to start off 2018. Bozzelli is a natural winner, winning four times in in 2014 on the NGA (Hooters) Tour and winning Rookie and Player of the Year honours that season. In the same year he played four times on the Web.com Tour, finishing in the top-10 twice.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
875	875	6	6	target: Kaufman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on List, Lovemark &amp; Kaufman in Las Vegas this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips #golf
357	357	69	69	target: (Mickelson) 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fact is though that the freshly extended 7,297 yard (up 81 yards from 2014 and 55 yards from 2015) par 71 - which is an original Arnold Palmer design - yields birdies, but only for those who are aggressive and on their game. Winning totals of -15 (Fowler 2015), -15 (Kirk 2014), -22 (Stenson 2013), -20 (McIlroy 2012), -15 (Simpson 2011), -22 (Hoffman), -19 (Stricker), -22 (Singh) and -16 (Mickelson) across the past 9 renewals show that the pure Bentgrass greens can yield plenty of birdies. Scoring tends to be dictated by the firmness of the greens, so with a relatively dry August and another lengthening of course yardage, we should expect around the same level of scoring as we have seen in the past 2 years.
7892	7892	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Right now, he only has 15 tags on FanShareSports, the fewest of any golfer priced above $9,500. In the past five Bridgestone Invitationals, Rose leads the entire field in total strokes gained. He has three top 5s in the past five years at Firestone.
8534	8534	23	24	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Making 10/10 straight cuts Brooks is a great cash play given his price and has shown the upside to win against any field. Tony Finau – DraftKings all formats – DK: $7300 FD: $8300  The price discrepancy is too much to avoid Finau on DraftKings this week. Finau has mad nine straight cuts, finishing inside of the top 50 all nine starts making him extremely viable in cash games at this price.
3353	3353	38	38	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T4 and T6 in his two most recent trips to Augusta National. Vegas Odds  As you see, Johnson has been excellent with double-digit odds to win. Of the 18 tournaments with at least 10 percent odds, DJ posted 100 DraftKings points or more in eight.
12220	12220	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
9891	9891	63	63	target: Chris 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago. A 4-time PGA Tour winner, Kirk won his first ever title on the Nicklaus-designed Annandale track in 2011 shooting -22/266 and Chris in many ways reminds me of a Jason Dufner-sort, i.e. an experienced PGA Tour winner who slowly but surely is coming back from a barren time.
13653	13653	53	53	target: Kevin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist. That's a potent combination for The Players Championship and Kisner seems the sort who could win this at a bulky price. 2nd at the Dell Matchplay in April, 2017 saw Kevin finish 3rd at the Tour Championship, lead the PGA Championship for 63 holes before finishing 7th, win the Invitational-status Dean & DeLuca Invitational at Colonial and finish 2nd at the Arnold Palmer invitational at Bay Hill.
11636	11636	31	31	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can just roll it at an average pace, like he did at this track last year, the reigning Masters champ will be near the top of the leaderboard. Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly.
13056	13056	57	58	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And I've been putting great, so if I can get myself on the greens and give myself the opportunities, hopefully the putter will take over and I can get myself in contention on Sunday. Last four events: 36-22-2-1  Course form: 22-10-28-20-3-WD-2  Last 10 majors: 9-27-MC-22-2-22-8-10-1-4  Last 50 starts - Win: 10%, Top 5: 28%, Top 10: 40%  Phil Mickelson - Tough to discount consistent Lefty  "There's not a course that I feel more comfortable on. The thing about Augusta is that for me personally, I don't feel like I have to be perfect, so it relaxes me.
4518	4518	22	22	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If there's one guy who could be called the horse for this course, it would be Sergio Garcia.. -- Michael Collins  Rickie Fowler  In 2015, Fowler played world-class golf down the closing stretch at TPC Sawgrass to win the Players Championship and plant his flag in the fairway as a world class player, following the "overrated" narrative that started in the media. Now a year removed from the hype of repeating, Fowler has the game to win again at the newly renovated course. He has four top-10s already this year, was in contention at the Masters until falling off on Sunday, and leads the PGA Tour in adjusted scoring average.
9071	9071	6	6	target: Olesen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One thing for sure is that Olesen will be desperate to make the European Ryder Cup team, as his compatriot Bjorn is the captain this time around. Given the strength in depth for Team Europe, Olesen would have to do something dramatic to make the team, without being accused of getting preferential treatment from his fellow Dane. A win at this event would be a springboard in the right direction and will certainly peak Bjorn’s interest.
13381	13381	1	1	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G. That being said, Murray is one of the best in the field this week with his mid-to-long irons and should be able to find the green in scoring position relatively easily. Although his putting numbers also don’t reflect well (154th), Murray still averages only 1.74 putts per hole which is T31, and his one-putt percentage of 40.7% is T50th.

11348	11348	19	20	target: Pat Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week he heads back to Mexico City where he gained 8 strokes on approach last year. Him and    Pat Perez  In the same mold as      Ranking the Field Imploded last week to miss the cut at the Honda. After the event, he was trying to hold back from talking about the conditions of the greens but you could tell he wasn't a fan.
350	350	114	115	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Adam Scott; 4) Phil Mickelson; 5) Emiliano Grillo; 6) Rory McIlroy; 7) Jason Kokrak / Ryan Palmer; 9) Kevin Na; 10) Jhonattan Vegas / Bubba Watson; 12) Jerry Kelly / Russell Knox; 14) Martin Laird / Webb Simpson; 16) Jordan Spieth / Charl Schwartzel; 18) Jason Day / Jason Dufner; 20) Chad Campbell.

13319	13319	54	56	target: Si Woo Kim, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously I say this with my tongue firmly in my cheek as my reasons for siding with Beau again this week go way beyond any kind of misguided loyalty. No, my main reason for backing Beau again this week is how hugely impressive I felt he was down the stretch in Houston and, unlike Si Woo Kim, until a couple of loose shots in the play off you could lay no fault at Beau’s door for him not taking the trophy home that week. Had this performance come out of the blue I would perhaps have been a bit more cautious but of course Hossler has been talked about as a potentially huge star of the game in the making for a long while now and he has been producing some good stuff on the tour all season without putting four rounds together until it all clicked in Houston.
6114	6114	15	16	target: Wesley Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week’s OWGR chart has some very interesting standouts this week, one of whom is Wesley Bryan who’s official world golf ranking is 40th in the world despite his sub $7k price tag. Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place. At some point I expect Wes Bryan to bounce back, and why not this week on a course that plays to Bryan’s strengths?
6392	6392	5	5	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Deal with it. *  Bill Haas & James Hahn – Haas has two T10s in five career starts, with four straight finishes inside the T25 overall entering play… HHHAAAAAHHHHNNNNNNNNN’s upside will be dictated by his putter. Much like we said about Kyle Stanley all season.

1141	1141	1	2	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			7. Rickie Fowler -- Fowler was a third-place finisher here last year, and he's coming off a good effort with Jimmy Walker in the World Cup. T-6 in his last solo start at the WGC-HSBC Champions.
1194	1194	16	16	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CareerBuilder Challenge picks: Winner: The Chezsticle (Reavie) Top 10: Spaun, Mickelson, Howell DK Sleepers: Na, Laird, Power OAD: Reavie
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
2851	2851	2	2	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Bill Haas - Haas was outclassed in Mexico, but he's otherwise been great this season. This is a good track for him, and he should have won here last year.
314	314	37	37	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Field: Top 100 in FedExCup Standings  TPC Boston, Norton, MA  Par 71, 7,216 yards  The Course  This week the FedExCup Playoffs travel to TPC Boston where it has hosted this The Deutsche Bank since 2003. Its Labour Day weekend in The US so this tournament will go from Friday-Monday. It is a par 71 layout with three par 5’s, four par 3’s and 11 par 4’s and has a tendency to give up very low scores.
1476	1476	44	44	target: Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mr Consistency is the lowest-risk call across the $10m+ players this week and is sure to be in the mix at PGA West, coming off a strong putting performance at Waialae. Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut.
9205	9205	45	46	target: Gary Woodland, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although the Tour is leaving many of the stars of last weekend in Las Vegas a few big names have made the trip down. Rickie Fowler will be making his season debut and is headlining the field and is joined by Patrick Reed, Charley Hoffman, Gary Woodland, Pat Perez and Zach Johnson. The event takes place at El Camaleon Golf Club, a par 71 measuring 7,031 yards.
2001	2001	15	16	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's finished in the top 15 in three of his last four starts on Tour. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  Lefty's another Pebble Beach ringer (four-time champion and runner-up last year). He's showing signs of a turn-back-the-clock season with top-25 finishes in his last three starts.
4408	4408	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Probably not. But he definitely should be in contention through Sunday… You could swerve on to Ryan Moore here, or eat the chalk with Matt Kuchar, but I’ll be rolling with Walker. A gamble?
2767	2767	0	1	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Brown ($6,700). I don’t think you’ll have to go too deep this week considering the strength of field, but if you want Justin Thomas or Henrik Stenson then Brown is a good option. He’s made eight straight weekends on Tour and was T-7 last year at Innisbrook.
12856	12856	31	31	target: Hadwin, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s strange behavior from someone who hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in Strokes Gained: Putting in each of the last two years (12th in 2016; 18th in 2017). Normally with Hadwin, it’s “I really hope his tee-to-green game can catch up to his putting.” Now, it’s the inverse. His lack of distance is worrisome, but he notched a T36 in his Augusta debut last year, and with some experience on these greens, plus an excellent track record at equally as lengthy Riviera (Hadwin gained the eighth-most strokes of any player in this field at the Genesis Open), pencil in Hadwin for the low, low price of $7,200 on DraftKings.
1110	1110	22	22	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk won this event in 2013 and has an average finishing position of 7.6 in his last three starts at this tournament. Kirk is in excellent form and has extremely good recent results at this track. He’s in play for all formats.
589	589	10	10	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters 🔥 takes: Winner: Rory Top 10: Rose, Casey, 🍔, Leishman Sleepers: Pieters, Kisner, Molinari
13327	13327	1	1	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Julian Suri  When Suri came to the States at Torrey Pines, the “pay way too much attention to golf” crowd was properly excited. An American bomber, playing primary on the European Tour, people just assumed Suri was Brooks Koepka 2.0. Hasn’t really panned out that way.
286	286	25	26	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five players to consider adding to your team...  1 Patrick Reed £14.5M  2 Ryan Moore £9.5M  3 Emiliano Grillo £12M  4 Johnson Wagner £5.5M  5 Brandt Snedeker £14M Another option is Brandt Snedeker, despite being disappointing last week we believe he has what it takes to bounce back so make sure he is in your team is your and looking to take good points this week. The Texan finished fourth last year and is good value to have in your team this week.
11206	11206	42	42	target: Anirban 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
3605	3605	6	6	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
9219	9219	3	4	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor. He has three top-25 finishes in his past five events played and finished T-32 last week at the Shriners.
11200	11200	10	10	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National with four top-10s. Donald had missed three straight cuts until a T37 last week at Riviera, another track where birdies are scarce. John Huh - $7,100 (125-1)  Huh has already teed it up 10 times this season.
12033	12033	28	28	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
246	246	19	20	target: Matt Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
1526	1526	44	45	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The winner in the desert in both 2010 and 2015, he obviously not only knows his way around these courses, but even as a quick player owns the patience necessary to play his best golf in the midst of a pro-am format. Jonathan Coachman: Kevin Kisner ($8,900)  Coming back on the mainland really makes the season feel like it is starting, unless you are Justin Thomas, who has already essentially qualified for the Tour Championship. Players seem motivated to step up their game.
3027	3027	19	19	target: Cejka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 is the year of the Canadians, EH?! Also consider: Peter Uihlein, J.J Spaun, Cameron Percy, David Hearn, Alex Cejka  These core players will garner the most exposure (40%+) in our lineups at the Puerto Rico Open. We will be using these lineups as staples and incorporating some of the deep sleepers you need at low ownership to take down a large GPP.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
449	449	1	1	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Day loves this course and it really shows in his results as he’s landed finishes of 2nd, 3rd, 11th, 7th and 12th here in his last 6 visits. Day has been a birdie or better machine at this course over his career and is a great course horse this week. Sean O’Hair is an interesting addition to this list coming off his great week at the Barclays.
9359	9359	28	29	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Sentry Tournament of Champions (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jordan Spieth  Justin Thomas    You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Patrick Cantlay; Brooks Koepka; Jon Rahm; Cameron Smith  Driving: Patrick Cantlay; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley; Brendan Steele  Approach: Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley  Short: Brian Harman; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Brooks Koepka; Pat Perez    Power Rankings Wild Card  16. Cameron Smith … First-timer comin' in hot.
10737	10737	4	4	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All signs point to Cantlay being a great play on this course if the conditions are as good as predicted. However, if conditions deteriorate, I could see Cantlay struggling a bit on the small greens. Pat Perez ($8.6K) – Pat Perez just seems to love these shorter coastal tracks, almost like an American version of GMAC with a mullet.
4498	4498	23	23	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
9798	9798	86	87	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This Week’s Event: 2018 Sony Open  PGA  CC.

6662	6662	10	11	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For more on List see this week’s PGA Breakdown. Downtown  Scott Brown is tied for 38th in the field with his respectable 70.2 LT Adj Rd Score, but his 69.9 Recent Adj Rd Score speaks to his current form: He has made three of four cuts and finished 12th at THE DEAN & DELUCA Invitational. Brown has shaky history at this event — he’s made only one cut in four starts — but he has a tendency to show up in weaker field events, finishing 17th and scoring 89.5 DraftKings points at the Puerto Rico Open earlier this season.
1544	1544	11	11	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sometimes you don't have to be long to dominate Par 5s. Johnson is well above average with his irons, ranking 41st in approaches from 125-150 yards last year and 63rd from 150-175 yards. With higher elevated greens this week, scrambling will be a key stat; Johnson ranked 25th in 2016.
4131	4131	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Everyone suffered from his missed cut last week. Now, Cink is merely an afterthought heading into the Valero Texas Open. Cink is still having a phenomenal season for his standards, consistently finishing inside the top 30 and making 11 of his last 13 cuts.
451	451	23	23	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and has a 10th and 4th in his past 5 visits. Jason Dufner has a fantastic record at TPC Boston. Since 2009 Dufner has yet to miss the cut at this event in 6 visits and also has a 2nd and a 9th place finish to his name here.
6582	6582	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has gained strokes on approach shots in six of his last seven events. There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it.
4813	4813	19	20	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s clearly the best value amoung the top three players on DK and the stud worth owning to me. Paul Casey ($10,200): I feel like I am beating the drum week after week here with Casey but he really has been excellent over his past few starts. Casey hasn’t missed a cut in nine starts overall, and while the lack of high finishes remains concerning his high ranking in par 4 scoring, scrambling and approaches make him an excellent target for this week’s slate on DraftKings.
10246	10246	5	6	target: Marc Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Marc Leishman is a Torrey Pines specialist who as we know is in cracking form right now. Talk of coastal golf, Kikuyugrass fairways and tough, technical scoring conditions on the South Course shouts Leishman from the rooftops and he certainly has the tools at his disposal to make a serious challenge this week, with no attention on him whatsoever. A tournament average score of 70.75 is only beaten by Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker and Charles Howell III amongst tournament regulars.
2029	2029	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
1231	1231	3	4	target: Michael Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open: Michael Kim 350/1
1820	1820	12	12	target: Castro: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Fire him up at $7,000.
7632	7632	24	24	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has averaged 17.0 birdies per tournament over his last three events, which is quite a bump up from his long-term mark of 13.6. Finau is an especially intriguing player given his length off the tee: He’s averaging a DD of 309.7 yards over the past year. He’s posted 13.1 birdies per tournament during that span, and his -4.1 average adjusted strokes on Par 5s is one of the better marks of the week.
12731	12731	20	20	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose than birdied 16 and Garcia made Par, despite both being within 8 feet with their tee shots, thus giving Rose the lead again – still with me? On 17, Rose bogeyed and Sergio birdied, meaning they were tied once again, going down 18. Both players missed their birdie putts on 18, Rose from 7 feet and Garcia from 5, leading to a play-off.
4310	4310	22	22	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That sequence includes finishing runner-up in this event at Quail Hollow in 2015 and also fourth at the same venue in 2012. Simpson is a member at QC so he clearly put the extra local knowledge to good use. Hopefully it will be a similar story this week.
10528	10528	39	40	target: Daniel Berger. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar is making his first PGA TOUR starts of 2018 so that is also a pass for me. With Z. Johnson always safe for a good finish at TPC Deere Run, I will save him for now and choose Daniel Berger. Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team for each DFS site, per week.
7676	7676	23	23	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His T2G game has been utterly superb this year, and he has the patience to handle a demanding test like Firestone. MID TIER  Sergio Garcia ($9,200) – Are there any superlatives we haven’t used yet to describe the season Sergio is having? Were it not for a terrible R1 at the British, he would’ve probably been in the mix for the entire event.
971	971	0	0	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ as the 4th highest DK price?? 6th, 10th, 6th, 1st, 9th in last 5. also, OWGR #1 if anyone had forgotten
7147	7147	8	9	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Marc Leishman at 50/1 (1/5 1-10)  1pt e.w. Branden Grace at 50/1 (1/4 1-6)  0.50pt e.w. Harry Ellis at 1500/1 (1/5 1-8)  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Two majors down, two to go in a puzzling 2017 and things don't get any easier with the 146th edition of the Open Championship, which returns to Royal Birkdale just north of Liverpool.
6309	6309	33	33	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My only concern is he did not play the similar courses on tour very well this season, but he also wasn’t in good form in general, so I can let that slide. Bud Cauley (DK: $7,700, FD: $7,500)    TPC Potomac seems perfectly suited to Cauley’s game. He isn’t long off the tee but is accurate when he is able to club down.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
490	490	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on. Jason Day ($9,300): Speaking of putting, the Aussie is in a class of his own with it comes to putting this year. Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end.
5043	5043	8	9	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Memorial  1. Dustin Johnson  2. Matt Kuchar  3.
3699	3699	31	31	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In truth, his strong play at the Masters was a continuation of the good form he's show over the last four or five months. In his last 10 PGA Tour events, Perez has a win, three top 10s, a further three top 20s and no missed cuts. It's the most consistent spell he's had in his career.
9520	9520	25	25	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
3505	3505	29	29	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is in the low $9K range on both sites and compared to his Vegas odds is a +3 value this week. Before missing the cut here last year, Fowler had made five straight in his career including a T12 in 2015 and T5 in 2014. Statistically, he is #3 on my model with a ranking of 4th in SG: Approach, 15th in SG: Around the Green, 16th in Driving Distance, 11thin Par 5 BoB% and 4th in Bogey Avoidance.
4713	4713	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has played this event the past two years and has 12th- and 10th-place finishes to show for it. Honorable Mentions: Jason Day ($10,100) and Brooks Koepka ($10,200)  I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is matt13jones) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on. Although I have expressed my personal view on the games and strategies above, they do not necessarily reflect the view(s) of DraftKings and I may also deploy different players and strategies than what I recommend above.
1600	1600	14	14	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm hoping Stallings' form lasts another week as I'm e/w on him, Henley &amp; Murray (long shot) at the Honda Classic. #golf #bettingtips
11582	11582	16	17	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think most will avoid because of the names around him and last week. Tier 2  Adam Hadwin $7,500 – Another guy who played well at the Genesis. He didn’t play here last year, but I like what I saw a couple weekends ago.
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
45	45	12	13	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
6495	6495	19	20	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGATOUR.COM fantasy columnist Rob Bolton lists his five against-the-grain selections for this week's event at the Old White TPC. Scott Brown … Back in action after a three-week break that supplanted seven straight weeks of competition. He hit that road trip running with a playoff loss teaming with Kevin Kisner in New Orleans.
9716	9716	0	1	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week. Thomas for a second-straight week will serve as defending champion, but don’t let last week’s performance scare you away. Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week.
1820	1820	12	12	target: Castro: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Fire him up at $7,000.
9725	9725	2	3	target: Daniel Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
3838	3838	33	34	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The experience building a lineup is very different, but you still need to identify guys you like in every price range – so here are a few names to get you started. High-Priced  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – He is expensive, his price tag identifying him as the clear class of the weekend, but he could be worth it if he keeps up his current level of play. If he is playing at his best, there is no one standing between him and at least a top-10 showing, making him a great option in any contest format.
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
829	829	13	13	target: Knost 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With huge greens this week then 3-putt avoidance will be crucial and Colt Knost ranked 23rd in 2016 for this while also ranking 1st for driving accuracy. Knost is a former US Amateur Champion and World No. 1 ranked amateur so we know he has ability.
6912	6912	35	35	target: McNealy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has the option of going on to play professional golf, where he will be the top prospect in the game, or following in the footsteps of his billionaire father, Scott, who co-founded Sun Microsystems. McNealy won the Haskins Award as the top collegiate golfer in 2015 and has competed on the PGA Tour several times in the last two years. The sky's the limit for McNealy, and in a soft field on an easy course, young Maverick should shine.
10817	10817	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Its pretty much the antithesis to last week’s event from a TV standpoint. Golfers to Consider:  $16,000+  Dustin Johnson ($17,100)  The best player on the planet, there’s just no questioning it. Off the tee, he’s going to be in position to score almost every single time.
2813	2813	21	22	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect Na to be in contention on Sunday just like he was in 2014 when he finished solo second. Taras Pitra: Graham DeLaet ($8,400)  It's tough to ignore what he's been doing this year (10th, 17th, 9th, 54th). Being ranked near the top of the tour in putting is the main reason we're seeing him near the top of the leaderboard.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
13359	13359	21	22	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I really like his chances this week on a hard course where aggressive driving is rewarded in spades. RESULT: T11  Xander Schauffele 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street.
3326	3326	2	2	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bonus statistics: Rickie is 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 1st in Scrambling. We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice.
11475	11475	27	27	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
1546	1546	11	11	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Decided to just do 2 ew doubles this week. Crocker/Johnston into Walker
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.
12223	12223	50	51	target: Rory McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After his slow start in Mexico JT duly nearly delivered on this stat producing a weekend of nearly flawless golf which culminated in the play-off loss to Phil. Now refreshed after a weeks break JT should be raring to go again and I see him as the main danger to Rory McIlroy. In his two previous starts in the Matchplay event JT is yet to show his best stuff exiting early on both occasions, however he showed at the Presidents Cup last autumn with a 3-1-1 record that he has what it takes for match play and I expect him to bring a lot of confidence from that showing in to this event.
11467	11467	35	36	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why it is so hard to bypass Justin Thomas, who actually was leading the tournament after three rounds a year ago, a shot ahead of Johnson, but faded to a 1-over 72. Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous.
6803	6803	70	71	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
1594	1594	8	8	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wow. Even with a nasty backslide on Sunday, Rahm still did what Rahm does best and birdied his way back to even par on the day. He’s just a sensational talent and an excellent candidate to find his first win this season.
10540	10540	20	20	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar is making his first PGA TOUR starts of 2018 so that is also a pass for me. With Z. Johnson always safe for a good finish at TPC Deere Run, I will save him for now and choose Daniel Berger. Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team for each DFS site, per week.
6324	6324	16	17	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently. Zac Blair ($7000) – On any course where accuracy matters more than distance, Blair has to be considered; the little Mormon hits 68.85% of fairways (15 th ) but struggles with longer distances – luckily with long approach shots (above 200), he’s 46 th on Tour and 20 th from 200-225. He’s not without his flaws, but he gains strokes on the greens, scores very well on par-3s (four of them on this course) and averages only 4.02 on par-4s.  )
8867	8867	13	14	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom.
123	123	27	28	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very much a form horse who thrives on Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and whose tee-to-green game - and scrambling - is top notch right now. RESULT: MC  Bubba Watson 1pt EW 45/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  So the blueprint for Bethpage Black is for longer hitters who are hitting plenty of greens and who like Poa Annua. Step forward Bubba Watson whose career results look very similar to 2012 victor Nick Watney.
1521	1521	1	1	target: @ollie_gt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @ollie_gt is worth a bet at 54/1 in the #GenesisOpen. Schniederjans took to Riviera on his first start at the… https://t.co/9KvYiUELGc
12838	12838	58	59	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Head to the request-a-bet section of their website, where you'll also find some enhanced odds on Ben's specials tips - including Walker or Henley to lead after round one, ties included, at 22/1. Click here for more  However, Augusta form is undeniably valuable so it's two more quality ball-strikers who complete the staking plan in the shape of Louis Oosthuizen and Kevin Chappell. Oosthuizen has been largely disappointing this year, but he did show up early on a couple of occasions prior to the Match Play, where he advanced from a group including Jason Day only to bump into a resurgent Ian Poulter.
5360	5360	37	37	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
4322	4322	33	33	target: Simpson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And Swede, Pettersson, who went to college in North Carolina, has settled here and he holds the course record at Eagle Point. Betting.Betfair's Dave Tindall is expecting big things from both Haas and Simpson. In-Play Tactics  The par five finishing hole will be reachable in two for the bigger hitters and we can expect to see a bit of drama and possibly change on the leaderboard come Sunday.
5786	5786	12	162	target: Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win: Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300 And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada: Golfer April 17, 2017 (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017 (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
11180	11180	26	27	target: Ryan Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take your shots where you feel confident, especially if a guy is known to play well in Florida but hasn’t performed in the past few outings. Ryan Palmer ($7.3K) – I am a supporter of Team Palmer this year and will likely be firing him up anytime he is under $8K this year until he wins. So, like I said, I’m not biased.
10377	10377	17	17	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kizzire is also the only player to have played 29 rounds or more and rank higher than Spaun in Par 4 Scoring Average, so this test looks to be right up Spaun’s alley this week. His T4 finish here 12 months ago was one of four top-10’s Spaun posted in 2017, with two of them coming at the start of this wrap-around season. He has finished inside the top-23 in 50% of his starts this season, with just two missed cuts, so a pretty successful start to the season overall.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
6606	6606	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can be tilting to follow live so I don’t recommend watching every shot. However, at this price Finau can allow you to avoid having to punt in cash games. Danny Lee ($16,400) – A former winner at this event, Danny Lee is riding a hot streak.
8406	8406	27	27	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore played Augusta twice as an amateur, finishing T45 in 2003 before returning in 2005 where he finished T13 and took the Low Amateur honours. In total Moore has played the Masters nine times, missing just two cuts and has finished inside the top-14 four times. Despite a lacklustre season, Moore did post his best ever finish at Augusta this year, finishing T9 and I hope his best finish in this event comes this year also.
9088	9088	41	41	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since getting wins on the European Tour in both 2013 and 2014, following a two-year absence from the winners’ circle, it has been far from plain sailing for the Englishman. Much to the bemusement of European Tour and Team Europe fans, Casey decided to count himself out of the running for Team Europe at both the 2014 and 2016 Ryder Cup’s. Casey did not agree with the qualifying criteria and would not commit to the required number of European Tour events to make the team.
5872	5872	15	15	target: Streelman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But I'll stick with my bigger prices this week and go for Lahiri, DeLaet and Streelman. He's had a strange season but is clearly coming back into form after that top six at Memorial when he led in the final round. I'm also very close to putting up two-time winner Bubba Watson at 30/1.
1613	1613	15	15	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The idea that Torrey Pines should suit his length and all-round skills isn't just theoretical. Swafford teed it up in this event last year and was T13. There is actually a precedent for a player scoring a first breakthrough Tour win and coming to Torrey and shining again.
3907	3907	26	27	target: Brendan Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him. Brendan Steele ($9,900) – Long, straight, and efficient – all of these things describe Steele, and also tend to describe players who succeed on this golf course. Not surprisingly, Steele’s track record here reflects his very high level of performance – he was in close contention up until Sunday where he slid back with a 75.
8456	8456	48	48	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don’t charge for the stats, all we ask is you please take a few minutes to help us out by rating/subscribing/reviewing the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE  Key Stats:  SG: T2G  SG: Approach  Driving Distance  P4 Scoring  App: 175-200 yards  Birdie %  Outright Bets:  Day 18/1  Finau 66/1  Hoffman 66/1  Moore 100/1  Xander 150/1 Check out the rolling stats! Stop using stats from March and April to make your plays!
4157	4157	4	5	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year.
11569	11569	29	30	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As for the weather, expect near-perfect scoring conditions with sunny skies for a majority of the week, high temperatures reaching 80 degrees and very little wind. Past Champions    2017- Dustin Johnson  2016 - Adam Scott  2015 - Dustin Johnson  2014 - Patrick Reed  2013 - Tiger Woods  2012 - Justin Rose  2011 - Nick Watney  2010 - Ernie Els  2009 - Phil Mickelson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Dustin Johnson - $17,900    The defending champion was victorious at the inaugural WGC-Mexico Championship held at the Club de Golf Chapultepec last year, and he’s maintained the No. 1 spot in the OWGR ever since.
9969	9969	2	2	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Jon Rahm – All Formats – DK: $11800 FD: $12500  It seems almost unfair to write about picking the top player in the field but there is no way I can shy away from Rahm this week. Despite being the clear favourite of the field Jon Rahm’s price is not overly inflated and he is only a few hundred more than the second price players (Harman and Phil(why?)) on DraftKings and FanDuel respectively.
10986	10986	13	14	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be decently low owned with all the names in this range. Bubba Watson $7,800 – Pretty good price for a guy who has won here twice. He is getting some form back, so I will try and hop on before he is super chalk.
5178	5178	28	28	target: Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar ranks 32nd in SG:T2G, 37th in Par 4 Scoring, and 11th in Scrambling. With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Tony Finau ($15,300) – I fully expect Finau to be chalky this week.
12866	12866	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott. He has made the cut every year since 2010 and posted four Top 10s in his past seven starts there.
2723	2723	51	52	target: Cameron Smith. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Four had already won at least once on the PGA Tour but three - Woodland (2011), Streelman (2013) and Senden (2014) - were making Innisbrook the scene of their breakthrough win. There is scope, therefore, to look further down the betting for a non-winner and the one that interests me is Cameron Smith. His fellow Aussie Senden has a win and two seconds here and nine of the last 15 editions have been won by overseas players.
8938	8938	3	4	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Emiliano Grillo  7. Luke List  8. Kevin Na  9.
10252	10252	12	13	target: Jhonattan Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like Brendan in cash or GPP lineups. Embed from Getty Images  Jhonattan Vegas $7,700 – Jhonny V is in tremendous form coming off a solid week at the CareerBuilder where he continued making birdies in bunches. Like Steele, he’s gained 19 strokes on the field in the last five years at Torrey Pines.
392	392	31	32	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What we have to hope is his putter gets hot, and perhaps his success on these greens in the past will carry him to the top of the leaderboard this weekend. Adam Scott ($10400)  Scott is my number one overall play this weekend. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster year for Scott who began the year as an outsider, one of the better players in the world held back by his poor putting since making the switch from belly to short flatstick.
895	895	35	36	target: Charley Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So he’s at least a pretty solid bet to make the weekend, and he showed too much promise on the Web.com circuit to think he won’t contend on the PGA Tour again soon. DraftKings bargain: Charley Hoffman. OK, his form coming in is troublesome to say the least (he’s missed his first two cuts of the 2016-17 PGA Tour season).
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
13347	13347	64	64	target: Piller 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His T4 here in 2016 only his second appearance at this course (T23 in 2011 on debut) but he has also shown form at the OHL Classic (T4 this season) to further justify his chances, so this is not based solely on that one standout performance here two years ago, nor is it about his love for all things Texas. On his last start, Piller scraped through the weekend on the number at the Houston Open, but weekend rounds of 70-67 saw him climb the leaderboard into a very respectable tie for 24th. Despite missing exactly 50% of cuts this season, Piller has two top-4 finishes to his name (T3 CareerBuilder and T4 OHL Classic), confirming that if the test suits, he is more than capable of making a run at thw title.
2188	2188	28	29	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
8175	8175	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler - $10,700 (15-1)    McIlroy was denied a third Quail Hollow victory by this man. Fowler bested McIlroy for the 2012 title in a playoff. He doesn't have quite the track record there as McIlroy, but Fowler has two other top-6s, including T4 last year.
1290	1290	19	19	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Focus aggressively on tee-to-green excellence and you will most likely be rewarded in kind. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays.
5651	5651	3	3	target: Dunne 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Paul Dunne at 400/1 Sky Bet (8 places;1/5 odds) This might seem a big ask but US Open’s have a habit of producing the odd funny result. His excellent short game should keep him in contention and it wasn’t that long ago that he lost in a playoff at the Trophee Hassan.
2849	2849	20	21	target: Adam Hadwin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,800) Hadwin doesn’t have the prettiest track record here, making 1/2 cuts with a 71st in 2015, but there is no way he should be this cheap with the way he has played this season. After missing the cut at The Safeway Open to start the season back in October, he hasn’t looked back making eight straight cuts, with four top 25s, two top tens, and a 2nd place finish at The Career Builder Challenge.
2340	2340	14	15	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
9993	9993	11	11	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's hard to rule anyone out. My hope is that Phil Mickelson can bring forth the ultimate combination of quality wedge play and dead-eye putting which have provided the foundations of a brilliant career, thus returning to winning ways for the first time since the 2013 Open Championship. Therein lies the chief negative for Mickelson, the total absence of recent winning form, but no way is he over the hill and I was really quite taken by his language in a brief interview with noted scoop-lander Tim Rosaforte.
10070	10070	24	24	target: Glover, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His 17th straight made cut has yet to result in a top 10 since the St. Jude; in other words, he is due. Lucas Glover, $7500 – Glover has yet to play this year, my own fret with this pick, but his tournament history makes up for it. Three straight made cuts and his approach game make everything disappear in regards to his putting.
2601	2601	1	2	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
9964	9964	4	4	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This short list includes Rahm, Mickelson, Harman, Kisner, Reed, and Simpson. Though anyone can emerge in an event like this, it would be a tragedy to not have at least one of the top 6 salaried players rostered this week. In any case, par-breakers are a must, so target guys who have shown recent low scores or perennially have proven they can go low.
11363	11363	6	7	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
1338	1338	0	0	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harkins 6.8k - playing really well right now. Only 1 MC in his PGA tour starts. B2B T15s, Long off the tee, seems t… https://t.co/bCLOuOxlkh
3673	3673	0	1	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Luke Donald ($7,800) – Donald’s certainly not a guy we rely on week to week, but at certain spots, he’s just ridiculous – this one of them. Since 2009, Donald has carded four (4) runner-up finishes along with two third-place finishes. It’s not hard to understand why with his particular skill set, but no matter how little you’d normally trust him, this is the spot to set that aside.
9493	9493	42	42	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DeChambeau generally has been a quick study in his time out on tour and has also put up some of his best finishes on more open, wind-exposed venues, landing T2 finishes at both Hilton Head (2016) and in Puerto Rico (2017). Considering DeChambeau had such a wild 2017 with lows that included seven straight missed cuts and highs that included a win, seeing him enter 2018 on a stretch of good golf — and filled with some confidence — means a good week here would not be shocking. He’s a golfer who seems to be just rising to his potential at the moment and looks like a great tournament and value target in this no-cut event at only $7,000.
6216	6216	27	28	target: Xander Schauffele; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) J.J. Henry; 2) Tony Finau; 3) Bud Cauley; 4) Kevin Chappell; 5) Bill Haas; 6) Xander Schauffele; 7) Nick Taylor; 8) Graham DeLaet / Marc Leishman / Kyle Stanley / Hudson Swafford; 12) Ben Martin; 13) Nick Watney; 14) Kevin Tway / Boo Weekley; 16) Rickie Fowler / Smylie Kaufman / Chris Kirk / Martin Laird; 20) Sung Kang / Patrick Reed. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) David Lingmerth; 2) Aaron Baddeley; 3) Rickie Fowler; 4) Billy Hurley III; 5) Grayson Murray; 6) Danny Lee / Sam Saunders; 8) Kevin Chappell; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Justin Thomas; 11) Morgan Hoffmann; 12) Si Woo Kim; 13) Ben Martin / Vaughn Taylor; 15) Byeong-Hun An / Tony Finau; 17) Bud Cauley; 18) Ricky Barnes / Patton Kizzire / Cameron Tringale.
8188	8188	11	11	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll be playing Scott in GPP and Cash contests confidently. Daniel Berger $7,700 – Berger is a bomber and is playing some great golf right now. He has recorded three Top 5’s in his past six PGA Tour events and has missed only four cuts in 17 starts this season.
5574	5574	59	59	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
6473	6473	17	18	target: Luke Donald. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I thought he was worth chancing a few pounds on and the same goes for course debutant, Luke Donald. Donald really should have won the Sony ten years ago when he was pipped at the post by Paul Goydos and he's another that's putting quite well. Selections:  Morgan Hoffman @ [140.0]  Luke Donald @ [180.0]    I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
11153	11153	51	51	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although this is his first appearance here, Noren has been known to play well on tight, windy setups with a win at the Scottish Open in 2016, T6 at the Open last year and a number of top 10’s in both Dubai and Qatar which is encouraging for this course. Tyrell Hatton 25/1  The Englishman has been in super form recently and hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in his last six starts. Since winning the Alfred Dunhill Links and Italian Open back to back in October, Hatton followed that with an impressive T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China.
4067	4067	17	17	target: Percy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The tight pricing requires you to find a few players priced near minimum that offer upside. Cameron Percy is that guy we are looking for that allows us to pay up for other players. Percy ranks 37th in Par 4 Scoring, 42nd in Bogey Avoidance, 55th in Birdie or Better %, and 90th in SG: Tee to Green.
13157	13157	8	8	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one. 2nd here in 2013 to G-Mac, Simpson was the 54-hole leader here last year before capitulating like leaders do here on Sunday. However we should be encouraged this week as Webb is in great form and, unlike last year, is putting nicely.
281	281	3	3	target: Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
8189	8189	20	20	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The FSU album is one of the best iron players in the game over the last 12-24 rounds he’s played. Berger has played Quail Hollow twice including no missed cuts and a Top 25. This is a bomber’s course and Berger has the length to compete and win.
383	383	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jason Day  Vegas Odds - 8/1  Draftkings - $12,500  FantasyAces - $6,200  What stood out to me more than anything last week was how awful Jason Day was off the tee(35% Driv Acc and ranked 72nd in SG:OTT) yet he was still able to finish T4 shooting a seven under par. Despite having to hit out of the rough for the majority of the four days he still had close to a 70% GIR(ranked T19) and led the field in SG:Putting.
47	47	46	46	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim is in great form and while he is a slow starter should fare just fine here as his average finish position is 30th. Furyk will be chalky but he should also be a safe play with some great scoring upside as evidenced by his 58. Jimmy should be a cash game staple this week from the upper echelon of this field.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
10945	10945	37	38	target: Chez Reavie, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is the first we have seen of Charl this season as he makes his way over to the States to gear up for Augusta. Charl has zero tags on FanShare Sports and is wedged in between Chez Reavie, Brendan Steele, and Thomas Pieters, all of whom are inside the top five most tagged early on this week. Charl missed the cut here last year, but he does have two top fives at this event in the past five years.
1358	1358	2	2	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@WMPhoenixOpen Picks Berger 40 Chappell 66 Hoffman 66 Piercy 75 Ollie 80 *Fowler 16 w. Patriots ML (-175) al… https://t.co/tlRzw6qW6U
10070	10070	23	24	target: Lucas Glover, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His 17th straight made cut has yet to result in a top 10 since the St. Jude; in other words, he is due. Lucas Glover, $7500 – Glover has yet to play this year, my own fret with this pick, but his tournament history makes up for it. Three straight made cuts and his approach game make everything disappear in regards to his putting.
7554	7554	33	33	target: Werenski 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The tour rookie missed five straight cuts in the middle of the season but has now put together eight straight under-par rounds and should be heading into this week with lots of confidence. Werenski will also be motivated by his current tour standing as he only ranks 155th in the FedEx Cup race at the moment, which would put him outside both conditional and full-time status for next season. He’s never played Glen Abbey before but has played his best golf at easier setups, as evidenced by both of his last two starts and his record on the Web.com Tour last season where he twice eclipsed 20-under par for the week.
6977	6977	8	9	target: Charley Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Charley Hoffman – $9,700  In a field of this magnitude (or lack thereof) figuring out the top tiered golfers that will be underowned is crucial. Charley Hoffman is shaping up to be that golfer this week.
1072	1072	39	40	target: Lucas Glover, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Last week I went with Russell Knox who came up just short, but collected $476K with his third-place finish.
8767	8767	65	66	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Matt Kuchar; 2) Webb Simpson; 3) Kyle Stanley; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Rickie Fowler / Russell Henley; 7) Brian Harman; 8) Paul Casey; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Pat Perez; 11) Jason Dufner; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Charley Hoffman; 16) Dustin Johnson; 17) Patrick Cantlay / Justin Rose / Gary Woodland; 20) Hideki Matsuyama. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Marc Leishman; 3) Paul Casey; 4) Hideki Matsuyama / Gary Woodland; 6) Rickie Fowler / Sergio Garcia; 8) Charley Hoffman; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Jason Dufner; 11) Russell Henley; 12) Kyle Stanley; 13) Jon Rahm; 14) Dustin Johnson / Matt Kuchar / Justin Rose; 17) Jason Day; 18) Pat Perez / Justin Thomas; 20) Kevin Chappell. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka; 2) Jason Day; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Rickie Fowler; 7) Paul Casey / Webb Simpson; 9) Xander Schauffele; 10) Hideki Matsuyama; 11) Jon Rahm; 12) Matt Kuchar; 13) Kevin Chappell / Charley Hoffman; 15) Jhonattan Vegas; 16) Marc Leishman / Patrick Reed; 19) Daniel Berger; 20) Russell Henley.
5299	5299	56	57	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World top 20 players in the form of Dustin Johnson and Lee Westwood have won this tournament in recent years, but so have Tour maidens Daniel Berger (33/1), Fabian Gomez (400/1), Harris English (66/1) and Harrison Frazar (275/1). This week the field includes Rickie Fowler (OWGR No.9), Adam Scott (No.12), Francesco Molinari (No.16), Charl Schwartzel (No.21), Brooks Koepka (No.22) and Phil Mickelson (No.23) who has decided to give next week's U.S. Open a miss. All in all though, it's traditionally one of the weaker tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule and offers a big opportunity for those whose game fits TPC Southwind.
5718	5718	43	43	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a proven wind player with two wins at The Qatar Masters in the windy Doha Golf Club, a win at Harbour Town Golf Links at the RBC Heritage in 2016 and a T13 this year at The Sony Open in Hawaii. Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency.
10952	10952	21	22	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brandon Harkins $6,800 – I could see him being the highest owned guy below $7,000, but he is playing very well. Adam Hadwin $7,100 – He is interesting to me because he has made 3 straight cuts here and hasn’t missed one on Tour since late August. Will probably go largely overlooked.
12541	12541	44	44	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price. Other values: Sean O’Hair ($7200)  Good luck this week!
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
2270	2270	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele comes here in much better form than he did last year and looks great value to keep up his good run of form here. Keegan Bradley 80/1  I was quite surprised to see Keegan Bradley at such a big price this week considering the form he’s in. He finished 2016 with three top 15’s in four events finishing solo sixth at the CIMB Classic, T7 at The Shriners Open and a T15 at the OHL Classic.
9710	9710	17	17	target: Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
382	382	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He doesn't seem to get mentioned as much as the five players ahead of him and this could be to our benefit this week. Scott hasn't missed a cut on tour this year and has picked up multiple wins for the third time in his career. Looking at the stats he is elite in many areas including Proximity(3rd), Par 4 Scoring(14th), Par 5 Scoring(12th), SG:APP(1st), SG:T2G(1st), BoB%(10th).
8406	8406	27	27	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore played Augusta twice as an amateur, finishing T45 in 2003 before returning in 2005 where he finished T13 and took the Low Amateur honours. In total Moore has played the Masters nine times, missing just two cuts and has finished inside the top-14 four times. Despite a lacklustre season, Moore did post his best ever finish at Augusta this year, finishing T9 and I hope his best finish in this event comes this year also.
1842	1842	69	70	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Standard eligibility rankings apply, whilst the following shall first be eligible:  AT&T Pebble Beach winners prior to 2000 and in the last five seasons The Players Championship and major championship winners prior to 2000 and in the last five years  In addition there is no Open Monday Qualifying for this event. Headlining the field is World No.1, Jason Day who is also joined by Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed from the world’s top-10. Day and Johnson will be looking for much better performances than they managed at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, as both players missed the cut in an event they were rightly favourites for.
13131	13131	17	17	target: Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Indeed we scored last August when we were on-board at 200/1 at the Wyndham Championship. In total, Every has placed in the FRL market 15 times on the PGA Tour and interestingly Harbour Town Golf Links is his most productive course when it comes to Thursdays: from 6 appearances he's been 4th (2012), 5th (2014) and 1st (2015) after 18 holes. With a lush golf course and green light conditions to go low on Thursday, I can definitely see Every in the mix again.
8213	8213	13	13	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has made seven straight cuts with four top-16 finishes entering this week. Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone?
8407	8407	2	2	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In total Moore has played the Masters nine times, missing just two cuts and has finished inside the top-14 four times. Despite a lacklustre season, Moore did post his best ever finish at Augusta this year, finishing T9 and I hope his best finish in this event comes this year also. Highlighting his average season are his largely poor stats but one area he does still excel in is Strokes Gained: Approach-The-Green ranking T24 which is an additional bonus for me.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
232	232	35	36	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well.

185	185	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SonyOpen Picks Luau Jimmy 22-1 Paul Casey 28-1 Russell Knox 40-1 Daniel 🍔 40-1 Scott Piercy 40-1 Chris Kirk 50-1 Harris English 60-1
10405	10405	22	22	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 :  Old White: Winner: Xander Schauffele; EW Places: Streb, Lovemark, Henley, Kraft, Finau, Blaum. Chapultepec: Winner: Dustin Johnson; EW Places: Rahm, Thomas, Mickelson, Snedeker. Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus.
10435	10435	0	1	target: Jon Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season. Rickie Fowler, $11900 – The flashy Fowler has lived up to his hype at the electric TPC Scottsdale, finishing fourth and second the last two years.
10633	10633	33	33	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Opens due to the presence of the amateurs and Rory's record in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship (three second places and a third) shows he enjoys a bit of 'giggle golf'. I expect McIlroy to say he's died and gone to heaven when seeing the courses this week. After his strong start to the season, it looks a great venue for him to take the next step and get back into the winner's circle.
6401	6401	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chez Reavie is three for three here, too: T18 in 2011, T62 in 2013, and T22 in 2015. Graham DeLaet has made all four cuts at the Greenbrier (T45 in 2010, T12 in 2012, T30 in 2013, and T37 in 2015). Kevin Na has also made all four cuts of his Greenbrier career: T36 in 2010, T7 in 2012, T52 in 2014, and T32 in 2015.
10268	10268	119	120	target: Shane Lowry, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J. Choi, J.B. Holmes and Stewart Cink and you have an event that seems pretty accessible to almost everyone.
1456	1456	36	37	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not. The secondary strength of the field is getting propped up by Francesco Molinari, Scott Piercy, Zach Johnson, Kevin Kisner, Bill Haas, William McGirt, and Kevin Na. Decent names, nothing great.
1604	1604	38	38	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's teed it up four times so far on this wraparound schedule and finished 8-27-13 before Christmas and also T9 in last week's CareerBuilder Challenge. The stats show he's been hitting it long and straight in recent times, Laird finishing 8th in Driving Accuracy last week and 2nd and 12th in DA before that. Allied to his length, it makes him a powerful proposition on this course.
766	766	7	7	target: Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is the ideal test for Bohn right now as he looks for a return to form. He has made just 6 of 15 cuts since returning, and his best finish was T35. The trouble is Bohn has struggled, understandably since suffering a heart attack at the Honda Classic last year.
9362	9362	24	25	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Sentry Tournament of Champions (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jordan Spieth  Justin Thomas    You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Patrick Cantlay; Brooks Koepka; Jon Rahm; Cameron Smith  Driving: Patrick Cantlay; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley; Brendan Steele  Approach: Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley  Short: Brian Harman; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Brooks Koepka; Pat Perez    Power Rankings Wild Card  16. Cameron Smith … First-timer comin' in hot.
10923	10923	15	15	target: DJ's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st. Pair that with the fact that he's the world's number-one ranked golfer, and he's a really tough fade.
1063	1063	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar. It's easy to wait on Kuchar since he's so consistent week-to-week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
51	51	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lipsky &amp; Canizares in Switzerland and Reed and Woodland in the US for me this week. #golf #betting #tips
7091	7091	30	31	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut in the Irish Open last time but, against that negative, he posted a top 10 in France two starts ago and was T18 at Augusta National. Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
3880	3880	16	16	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average. The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Horschel clearly loves this course and he’s kind of due for a victory since his last one coming in the 2014 Tour Championship.
5455	5455	15	15	target: Cink: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints. Stewart Cink: $8,000  Cink arrives on the strength of top-25 finishes in three of his last four starts. He’s never missed the cut at the FedEx St. Jude.
12384	12384	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
5468	5468	24	24	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But so many of the recent US Open winners are ultra-talented, big-hitting players with cool temperaments, who do everything well. That would certainly describe Fowler, who also sits 1st in the All-Around stats which measure driving, irons, bunker play, putting, scoring and birdie/eagle ranking. So, could Fowler be the latest to debunk the myth that you have to be a renowned straight hitter to win the US Open?
1017	1017	16	17	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world.
8263	8263	2	3	target: Matt Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T72  Matt Every 0.5pt EW 250/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Matt Every 0.5pt EW FRL 200/1 with New! £50 welcome offer via this link:  Matt Every is showing definite signs of improvement of late and we know that he simply thrives on Bermudagrass greens.
12654	12654	23	23	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t make this stuff up. Still, despite bleeding strokes to the field on the putting surfaces in four of his past six starts, List has piled up six consecutive Top 30s, with two Top-10 paydays. It’s about getting to the green for List.
1846	1846	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here.
3811	3811	36	37	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Morgan Hoffmann ($7,000): With local ties to the area and a recent career-best at the Honda Classic, Hoffmann has a lot of potential but I'm keeping on the front end since he's not the safest option. Jason Dufner ($8,300): Is playing steady golf this season. He's been inside the top 30 thru 36 holes in 9 of his last 10 starts, so you know where I'll be placing him this week.
4660	4660	66	66	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two of my three picks did make the cut (Kisner, Kaymer), but both struggled on the weekend; however, I did spot on nail my BUST pick of the week on previously red hot Jon Rahm, as he imploded on Saturday and failed to secure a Sunday tee time with his MDF finish. Now, let’s hop into some picks for this week:  LOCKZILLA (Last week: Kaymer t-69th)    Jordan Spieth– Looking purely at his end finish results and you might think that Spieth has struggled here. But, don’t forget that Jordan was the man to beat heading into Sunday here last year, after opening rounds of 64-65-67, before imploding to a Sunday 75 for a t-18th finish.
3853	3853	18	18	target: Perez. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perez looked good at Augusta and has a good track record at Harbour Town. Russell Henley and Pat Perez. Henley is on a roll after a win in Houston and T-11 at Augusta National.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
8211	8211	20	21	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RELATED: 13 picks to win the PGA Championship  And for those of you playing other fantasy golf formats:  Yahoo! lineup: Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm (Starters); Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Charley Hoffman, Brooks Koepka (Bench). Knockout/One-and-done pick: Rickie Fowler.
11165	11165	14	15	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why scrambling is so important this week. last year, Rickie Fowler and co-runners-up Gary Woodland and Morgan Hoffmann all finished top-10 in scrambling. The year before, the top-8 finishers were all top-12 in scrambling.
2286	2286	20	20	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won’t be over-owned because of an egregious miss price but also provides enough upside to stomach paying that price. Casey is one of my favorite bets on the board this week at 50-1 and is my early lean for a One and Done selection. Brandt Snedeker – $7,600  Your free space for the week is Brandt Snedeker.
11426	11426	1	1	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Perez – $7,400  Pat Perez stuck out as one of the best values on the board, and a great option to pair with DJ in your builds. Perez has been all over the map to start the 2018 season, making an odd trip to Dubai in the middle of the west coast swing. His results haven’t been great, but he is making cuts and gaining strokes in the key categories.
8009	8009	17	17	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Holmes is a past winner at Quail Hollow with his triumph in the 2014 Wells Fargo Championship. Holmes isn’t in the greatest of form, but he has two top-15 finishes in his last four starts, with a 14th at the RBC Canadian Open and a ninth at the Greenbrier Classic. He had two good rounds at Firestone in the WGC-Bridgestone, including a final-round 67 to get a silver lining out of a bad weekend.
1290	1290	18	19	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Focus aggressively on tee-to-green excellence and you will most likely be rewarded in kind. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays.
902	902	26	26	target: Randolph 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back in a big way this week after a bit of hiatus, S/O to @FantasyJesusDFS for the stats! 💰💰💰 CHoff 33 An 40 🎯🎯🎯 Beau 125 Randolph 125
10160	10160	16	16	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s also been impressive at the CareerBuilder in recent years, finishing T3-T14 in 2017 and 2016. Cauley is top-12 on Tour in both SG: Tee-to-Green and SG: Putting this season, while he’s also 26th in terms of proximity. Chris Kirk - $14,500    Kirk has posted back-to-back top-10 finishes heading into the CareerBuilder Challenge, where he notched a top-25 result in 2017.
8386	8386	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama. Whilst Day couldn’t get the job done on his last start, I think he has shown enough to contend again, at a course he should enjoy. Despite Day seemingly struggling for most of the season, Day still ranks a very impressive 2nd in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green and that is particularly pleasing ahead of this event.
7740	7740	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/5 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brooks Koepka 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (5 places EW, 1/4 odds):  Jordan Spieth arrives at another strict ball-striking test as the bookies favourite this week and after riding his luck and putting incredibly well at the end to win The Open Championship a fortnight ago at Royal Birkdale, whether he can repeat that feat here remains to be seen. Firestone South isn't the best fit to Spieth's game, however the same could be said of the Southport links and we all saw what happened there.
3302	3302	43	44	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  The field this week is loaded with potential Augusta contenders and players who will be trying to get the outright win and book their last minute ticket to the year’s first major. Elite players with something to prove like Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson will all be using this week to prepare for Augusta, while others like Charles Howell III, Tony Finau and Billy Horschel will all be chasing a win and the last potential spot into the Masters. Last week’s second place finisher from the match play event, Jon Rahm, will also be in attendance giving DraftKings players plenty of talent to choose from.
8449	8449	44	45	target: Charley Hoffman; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Gary Woodland; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Chad Campbell; 6) Rickie Fowler / Ben Martin; 8) Graham DeLaet; 9) Jason Dufner / Russell Henley; 11) Francesco Molinari; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Ollie Schniederjans; 14) Charley Hoffman; 15) Tony Finau; 16) J.J. Henry / Marc Leishman / Xander Schauffele / Steve Stricker; 20) Blayne Barber. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 4) Matt Kuchar; 5) Paul Casey / Xander Schauffele; 7) Rickie Fowler; 8) Justin Thomas; 9) Sung Kang / Grayson Murray; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Daniel Berger / Jordan Spieth; 14) Jonas Blixt / Robert Streb; 15) D.A. Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
11997	11997	21	22	target: EMILIANO GRILLO 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As with our first two picks this week it’s again hard not to see another big week for the Swede ahead. EMILIANO GRILLO – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 26th    I backed Grillo in this event last year and he duly lead the event on day one before sitting one shot of the pace at halfway. After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils.
12299	12299	53	53	target: Kelly 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the title beating the favourite in the final - one Patrick Cantlay. That final was played in windy conditions and one look at Kraft's professional CV tells you he has no issues in technical conditions or by the coast. So if this gets pretty gnarly across the weekend I can see Kelly progressing along ok, especially if my assumption of a -17/18 winning total is correct.
11505	11505	28	29	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On that note, Casey ranks 6th in the field in DK scoring putting him just below favorites like DJ, Rahm, and JT but at a much cheaper value. Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself.
16	16	15	16	target: Harold Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
2314	2314	4	5	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic  Defending Champ: Adam Scott  FNTSY Sports Network’s Pat Mayo & Derek Farnsworth discuss their favorite Honda Classic DraftKings picks. The guys preview the course, debate the best roster construction for the week and explain which players are best suited for DFS cash games and which should be deployed in guaranteed prize pool (GPP) tournaments. Honda Classic Field  144 Players | Top 70 & Ties After 36-Holes Make the Cut  The PGA’s shift from the West Coast to the East means we’re dealing with new types of grass, different gusts of winds, and, most importantly, the removal of the Thursday safety net for filling out our lineups.
11939	11939	20	20	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kizzire has taken 11 events, whilst Thomas has done it in just 8, but it is an impressive effort nonetheless. Kizzire missed the cut on debut here last year, but as stated earlier mediocre course form can be overcome, it is the experience that is vital. Returning a better player this time around, Kizzire will be keen to improve in an event that could well suit now his game is in better shape.
6141	6141	1	1	target: Lahiri, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Enter Lahiri, who is currently ranked fourth in Birdie Average, ninth in Birdie or Better Percentage and 16th in par four Birdie or Better Percentage. In short, Lahiri can pile up the DK points fast when he’s on and looks like he’ll be a great fit for a course which is typically one of the most lenient on tour in terms of scoring. When you add in his recent form (T2 at Memorial) and the fact he is coming off 10 days of “meditation” according to his Twitter account (@anirbangolf), he makes for a very interesting play this week in DFS and one that could yield a ton of DK points if things go well.
733	733	17	18	target: Martin Laird; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Patrick Cantlay; 2) Brian Stuard; 3) Luke List; 4) Gary Woodland; 5) Martin Laird; 6) Charley Hoffman / Vaughn Taylor; 8) Harold Varner III; 9) Ryan Armour; 10) Brandon Hagy / Adam Schenk / Bubba Watson; 13) Kevin Chappell / Matt Jones / Rob Oppenheim / Sam Saunders; 17) Corey Conners; 18) Alex Cejka / Brice Garnett / Chesson Hadley / William McGirt. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Tyrone Van Aswegen; 2) Tony Finau; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Chesson Hadley / Kevin Na; 6) Jonathan Randolph; 7) Kevin Chappell / Andrew Landry / Scott Piercy; 10) Derek Fathauer / Daniel Summerhays; 12) Joel Dahmen / Shawn Stefani; 14) Brice Garnett / Charley Hoffman / Morgan Hoffmann / Webb Simpson; 18) Rory Sabbatini; 19) Beau Hossler / Graeme McDowell; 21) Martin Laird. Winners & Prices : 2016: Pampling 300/1 ; 2015: Kaufman 250/1 ; 2014: Martin 225/1 ; 2013: Simpson 20/1 ; 2012: Moore 14/1 ; 2011: Na 60/1 ; 2010: Byrd 50/1 .
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
9858	9858	38	39	target: DAVID LINGMERTH 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In addition of course it means we are getting 66-1 about a player who clearly loves the event and I’m happy to take a chance at that price that the return to La Quinta will reignite his game. DAVID LINGMERTH – 66-1 - 1pt E/W – 1/5 odds 1st 6 Finish 57th  Finally I will close my selections for this week by weighing in with David Lingmerth in this event for the third year running. I still wake up with the occasional nightmare about ‘Duf’s shot of the rocks here in 2016, which basically cost me a 66-1 winner on Lingmerth!
2022	2022	34	34	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Fiction. First, the only reason you could question Spieth’s recent performances is because he hasn’t won since the Dean and Deluca Invitational last year. And I get it – if Jordan is going to be the highest-priced player every week he tees it up, you really do want him to win.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.
10971	10971	16	17	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
537	537	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke. Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13
1074	1074	16	17	target: Ryan Armour… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Interesting stat from Kapalua: Dustin Johnson had 39 opportunities for birdie or better inside 20 feet. Ryan Armour… https://t.co/GmdWS6oPSM
708	708	14	14	target: Poston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			100 to 1 bets that should peak your interest Danny Lee Cam Smith JT Poston Scott Piercy
10543	10543	9	10	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the short list of truths to be self-evident, Hideki Matsuyama at the Waste Management Phoenix Open appears. No, the history doesn't predict the present, but we compete in an imperfect fantasy world. This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident.
12272	12272	52	52	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He already has a win at Torrey Pines followed by a T2 at Pebble Beach to his name this year though, so I have no concerns about his form in general. A two-time winner of this event, who has already won this year it is incredibly easy to make a case for Day and that’s why I will not go on for too long. Form figures of 1-T2-T22 in 2018 suggest he is in fine form, despite some average iron play, so he can easily win an event he loves, in a format he dominates.
1042	1042	31	32	target: Chris Kirk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar. It's easy to wait on Kuchar since he's so consistent week-to-week.
2682	2682	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ollie Schniederjans at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) – nice opportunity to add his name to the list of young PGA Tour winners  1pt e.w. Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w.
7444	7444	31	31	target: Hagy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although it’s not an impact stat in relation to finish position, distance has a very strong relationship to birdie-making, which will be important on an easy course. The one area where Hagy has struggled immensely is on approach, and that’s essentially the reason his price is where it is – he sits 182nd and loses strokes to the field. Hagy could be this week’s Luke List, who doesn’t finish well but scores tremendously.
6091	6091	52	52	target: Charley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charley Hoffman: Unlike Leishman, Hoffman made a weekend charge at the U.S. Open, finishing in eighth place. Hoffman is tied for 18th with his 69.4 LT Adj Rd Score, tied for seventh with his impressive 68.3 Recent Adj Rd Score, and tied for sixth with his 15.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg. Additionally, Charley has two top-10 finishes at this event in his last four trips, and he hasn’t finished worse than 26th in that time.
577	577	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will.
3803	3803	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The following is the top 10 in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round over the last two years: Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Bill Haas, Branden Grace, Kevin Na, Martin Kaymer, Ryan Palmer, Marc Leishman, and Brandt Snedeker). Golfers that raise the flag for course history and long-term skill include: Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar, Branden Grace, and Kevin Na. While Furyk and Grace are the past two champs here, they aren't playing up to their standards right now, so I will pass.
11765	11765	2	2	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style.

7022	7022	14	14	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this cheap price tag, Luck is the perfect GPP play this week. Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events.
744	744	25	25	target: Berger/Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No clue what sort of Zurich exposure I will have .. Looking forward to see how they price the field but I want ALL the Berger/Pieters
5016	5016	44	44	target: Ikeda. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My hopes are that this price will keep ownership down on a golfer who has three straight top ten finishes, and two straight top 25 finishes at this event. The other interesting golfer that shows up on the OWGR vs. Salary chart is Yuta Ikeda. I’ll be the first to raise my hand and admit I don’t really know this golfer at all, however a quick google search shows that Ikeda has a win on the Asian tour in every year between 2009 and 2016 racking up a total of sixteen wins internationally.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.
5228	5228	21	21	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week. Adam Hadwin – $7,600  Adam Hadwin was heavily owned last week, and even though he didn’t miss the cut, he certainly didn’t win anyone money. Hadwin only has six tags on FanShareSports, clearly showing people have already moved on.
10437	10437	26	26	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough. English has not only put up 6-of-6 made cuts, he’s finished inside the top-15 three times at TPC Scottsdale! Now, English did underperform last year, but he’s a two-time PGA Tour winner with youth and upside to bounce back.
1560	1560	6	6	target: Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last pre-event #GenesisOpen bet: FRL - Saunders @125s - 0.65pts e/w 15th last year on BoB% on par 4s and has a ha… https://t.co/5KqA1LAPT0
5191	5191	22	22	target: Scott: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day’s 62.1 LT SC percentage ranks fourth, and he is tied for sixth overall with his 15.1 LT Adj Bird Avg. Adam Scott: Scott hasn’t played here since 2014, when he finished fourth. Scott’s 70.7 LT GIR percentage is fourth, and his 15.0 LT Adj Bird Avg is eighth.
12109	12109	8	8	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That is the obvious risk you take whenever Scott finds his way onto your roster. However, if his ball striking is back to a place where we expect Scott to be, the putter will show up on occasion and you have to take your shots with him. Scott has three made cuts at Arnie’s tournament, including a 3rd place finish in 2014.
108	108	7	8	target: Brett Stegmaier 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shriner's Open bets: E/W Adam Hadwin 125-1 Brett Stegmaier 300-1 FRL Ricky Barnes 125-1
2113	2113	36	36	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This season he is still losing strokes to the field but it’s getting better and he might get away with it at Riviera; his record at the course is MC-2-16-20-4-MC losing in a playoff in 2012. Bradley strength has always been tee-to-green and that department is working well again. He recently finished T4 at Torrey Pines, another demanding layout and has six top-25s in just eight starts this season.
113	113	8	9	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Brooks Koepka  Mid Tier $9,500-7,500  Matt Kuchar ($9,200): The Kuch is back in the states, riding the patriotic wave from his Bronze medal performance in Rio. Kuchar is a tailor-made cash play here as usual. Solid form, solid event history, and solid stats for the course, what’s not to love about the Kuch?
8166	8166	7	7	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other Options: Jon Rahm    Mid-Tier Plays    Adam Scott (DK: $8,600, FD: $8,400)    Adam Scott is a tee-to-green master and has been scoring consistent but not spectacular results all season. The worry with Scott is how awful his putter is, but with reports being that these greens are lightning fast, we may see the entire field struggle making putts. He also has a nice narrative since he is expecting a child shortly after the event, so this should be his final tournament of the season.
2393	2393	17	18	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Great price, cash worthy. Economy  Billy Horschel $7,200  Nick Watney $7,100  Kyle Stanley $7,100  Martin Flores $7,100  Stewart Cink $7,100  That’s it for this week. I think it is a great week to focus on cash games and build some bankroll.
10883	10883	55	55	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He struggled at first despite dropping a hint with T25 in 2011 but in the last two years he's broken par in all eight rounds, finishing T11 in 2016 and T8 last year when dropping out of the payout places with a bogey at 18 although he still signed for an excellent 66 on Sunday. Laird twice eagled the easy par-5 opener that week and says of Riviera: "I just love this golf course." Hence it's one of the first tournaments pencilled in on his schedule.
3298	3298	1	2	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having Jordan Spieth sitting $1,300 more than any other golfer(on DraftKings) is going to, in my opinion, push a lot of people down to start a more balanced lineup. If you know me or have read my articles in the past, you have probably noticed that I always favor Spieth, especially this time of year. For a feel of where ownership is going to be this week, be sure to head over to FanSharSports where they track all the social media mentions of all players throughout the week.
282	282	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
12874	12874	59	59	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The prudent move will be to take him out of your lineups completely, however some people enjoy a higher degree of risk and will hope that his ankle is fine.

5226	5226	9	10	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Jason Dufner – $8,700  Duf-man was a very popular pick last week at the Dean and Deluca. He was highly owned across all formats and even in one and done pools.
6628	6628	20	21	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because of that dynamic, ownership levels are projected to be fairly even among many of the high-priced guys. Not until James Hahn at $8,800 on DraftKings — he has the 14th-highest salary in the field — do we find someone projected for potential single-digit ownership at nine to 12 percent. Sung Kang is the first golfer below that; he’s $8,600 and is currently projected for five to eight percent ownership.
890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
4614	4614	27	27	target: Schwartzel. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen is among the second wave of the market having shared second last week, but at twice the price I'm keen to chance his compatriot Charl Schwartzel. The obvious negative is that Schwartzel missed the cut at the PLAYERS, but he's never played well at Sawgrass, a course which perhaps demands more patience than he possesses, and it's just not any kind of factor as far as I'm concerned. Prior to that, he was of course third in the Masters, a much better measure of his overall game, and having dusted off the cobwebs in Florida I'm hopeful that he could get in the mix from an early stage here.
750	750	1	1	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9,800) – Perhaps the biggest issue with Rahm’s game is his tendency to get a little off with the big stick. However, if we take away most of the usual penalties associated with being a little crazy off the tee, few golfers boast the full package that Rahm does with such explosive scoring potential. He’s a lock.
302	302	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our pundit bids to continue his fine form as the PGA Tour playoffs move on to Boston... The winner: Rickie Fowler  If there is a player with the temperament to quickly recover from blowing a big PGA Tour win then it is Rickie Fowler. It looked like he was going to trade blows down the stretch with Patrick Reed until a huge wobble – bogey at 15, double at 16 and bogey at 18 – dropped him into a tie for 7th  Maybe I am a glass half full kind of guy but I saw lots to be positive about in Fowler’s play ahead of his defence of the Deutsche Bank at TPC Boston this week.
2342	2342	20	21	target: Daniel Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
627	627	26	27	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas. 2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose.
4330	4330	0	1	target: Shane Lowry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry … Let's try this again. His last appearance on this page was for the Masters but his putter didn't cooperate as was the need. Four weeks later, strong putting is neutralized in the context of unfamiliar surfaces.
8491	8491	22	22	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He gained 1.37 and 3.22 strokes respectively on the field in those two tournaments so there are only positives to be taken. Reed plays this year's FedEx Cup opener on the back of his best ever performance in a major - tied second in the PGA Championship - so his already unwavering confidence levels will be even higher. The good thing with the American is that he's not settling for what he's got.
3026	3026	18	18	target: Alex 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The winner typically finishes in the mid to upper teens under par in ideal conditions. Back in 2015 Alex Cejka finished -7 when the wind was howling as compared to Chesson Hadley coming in at -21 back in 2014. Since the tournament usually features plenty of scoring, we are going to target players with a strong Birdie or Better %.
8214	8214	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone? Jamie Lovemark (150-1): Seems to be made for majors this season – T-27 at U.S. Open and T-22 at British Open this year.
1151	1151	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY PICK : Henrik Stenson ($9,400)  It’s hard to pick one player to stand out from what is basically an all star field of golfers this week. Still, I do see this as an opportunity for Henrik Stenson to end his already amazing 2016 with a bang. Stenson won the Open Championship in maybe the most brilliant display of golf in a major ever, nearly won the Olympic gold and was just his usual cool self all year.
11191	11191	27	28	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key stats follow in importance. • Driving accuracy  • Greens in regulation/strokes gained approach  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Bogey avoidance      Past Champions    2017 – Rickie Fowler  2016 - Adam Scott  2015 – Padraig Harrington  2014 – Russell Henley  2013 – Michael Thompson  2012 – Rory McIlroy  2011 – Rory Sabbatini  2010 – Camilo Villegas  2009 – Y.E. Yang  2008 – Ernie Els    Champion's Profile    Looking at last year's leaderboard, most guys in the top-10 had at least one double-bogey or even a triple-bogey.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!
3874	3874	9	10	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Brendan Steele & Branden Grace – On the heels of an impressive Sunday at The Heritage, Grace seems to have finally righted his game. As will be the theme with many of the picks this week, the South African dominates off the tee and with his irons, but is lost on the greens.
10090	10090	45	45	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Martin is swinging the hot stick right now and could be just what you need to round out your roster this week. In his last two events (Sony Open, RSM Classic), he’s finished T 7 and T 22 with 20 total birdies in each event. Martin has shot in the 60s for seven straight competitive rounds; nothing to sneeze at regardless of the course difficulty.
828	828	14	14	target: WEBB 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
5459	5459	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
8986	8986	23	24	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We head overseas for a smaller field event in the CIMB Classic. This event has been dominated by two men in recent years, Justin Thomas and Ryan Moore. With the shortened field, cash is not recommended, but it is certainly still an option, especially if there’s overlay.
3247	3247	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose’s driving accuracy may be down in 2017, but his combination of precision and power should play well on a long track in Texas. Also like: Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. Both of these guys are in great form and play well at this course.
3829	3829	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Brit returns to action at arguably his best course. Donald has never won at Harbour Town, but he has four runner-ups and two thirds. Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well.
1522	1522	0	0	target: CHOI 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CHOI has an impeccable record at Riviera. https://t.co/iNGBsDFpIs
5736	5736	1	1	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose - $16,600    The 2016 Masters runner-up has been a world-class ball striker for years, but a below-average putter has limited Rose to just one career major victory. With rain in the forecast throughout the week, Erin Hills’ greens are projected to soften up a bit, lessening the margin between Rose and those who usually maintain a putting advantage. He’s top 10 on Tour in SG: off-the-tee and fifth in par-four scoring, and is priced a whole $1,300 cheaper than Jason Day.
5184	5184	17	17	target: Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can avoid the bunkers this week, a top-20 from the Canadian is in the picture. Streelman missed the cut three years in a row from 2012-2014 at the Memorial, but he has since finished T18-T8. He’s top-50 on Tour in driving accuracy, and recently ranked fourth among the field in terms of SG: approach-the-green at the DEAN & DELUCA Invitational, where he finished T18.
1062	1062	6	6	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First @SonyOpenHawaii bet is Si Woo Kim at 66/1. Kim finished fourth on sole course start in 2016 and could benefit… https://t.co/2vHlNe7IgC
2357	2357	1	1	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays. Grace is also 37th in greens in regulation percentage. There’s also the fact seven of the last nine winners of the Honda Classic weren’t from the United States.
9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.
5233	5233	7	7	target: Perez’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The last couple of events he saw Perez’s price tag creep a little high for my liking, even though he was still playing well and the course fit his game. Now we can roster Perez without the expectation of a T15 and be pleasantly surprised when it happens. Perez is flying under the radar this week after multiple weeks being hyped up.
731	731	6	6	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
570	570	5	6	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5. Emiliano Grillo - $6,900  6.
11241	11241	28	28	target: "Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking to back outsiders in this week's golf tournaments? Paul Krishnamurty has scoured the list of players available at 99-1 or more, recommending three picks and some alternatives...  "Poulter is always worth considering when in Florida, where he has a home. His record on Bermuda greens is excellent and he's contended strongly for most of the Florida Swing events.
6979	6979	17	17	target: Hoffman’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With only 15 tags on FanShareSports, he has the third fewest out of anyone priced above $9K. Hoffman’s recent form is incredible, with an 8th place finish at the U.S. Open followed by a T3 at the Travelers. Maybe it only took a couple weeks off to forget what Charley has been up to?
567	567	1	2	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Paul Casey -- Casey has been in position to win each of the last two playoff events, and that's probably a safe bet to continue here at East Lake. 5.
5318	5318	3	3	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like Gomez though, Brown shares an affinity with Coco Beach G&CC in Puerto Rico and the Georgian also has lots of linkable form across PGA National (10th 2016), Copperhead (7th 2016), Harbour Town (5th 2014), Sedgefield (3rd 2015), Annandale (5th 2012), El Camaleon (5th 2015) and Sea Island (4th (2013). He clearly loves Bermudagrass greens, warmer climes and with best mate on Tour Kevin Kisner winning 2 weeks ago at Colonial, Brown is likely to take inspiration from that this week.

2603	2603	27	27	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
856	856	19	19	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - @THEPLAYERSChamp 2.5ew Garcia 18-1; 1ew Thomas 35-1, Matsuyama 25-1; 0.5ew Chappell 60-1, Fowler 22-1, Scott 45-1
4739	4739	1	1	target: Kang 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sung Kang – $7,400  Why not make it two consecutive wins for South Koreans? Even without the Si Woo Kim bump, Sung Kang would have been a fantastic play this week, as he enters the Byron Nelson with second best recent form other than DJ. Kang has quietly recorded four top 11 finishes in his last five events.
5551	5551	7	8	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, we're left with just two players. Justin Rose and Kevin Kisner. Four of the last six US Open winners had made the top 10 at Memorial a few weeks earlier so that event really does seem an ideal prep.
12704	12704	54	55	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is also live coverage on BBC2 on Saturday and Sunday, and they also have Red Button coverage from mid-afternoon over the weekend, showing featured groups, Amen Corner, and holes 15 and 16. Last Ten Winners  2017 - Sergio Garcia -9 (playoff)  2016 - Danny Willett -5  2015 - Jordan Spieth -18  2014 - Bubba Watson -8  2013 - Adam Scott -9 (playoff)  2012 - Bubba Watson -10 (playoff)  2011 - Charl Schwartzel -14  2010 - Phil Mickelson -16  2009 - Angel Cabrera -12 (playoff)  2008 - Trevor Immelman -8  What Will it Take to Win the US Masters? Sergio Garcia's stats were incredible last year and it's hardly surprising he won.
1003	1003	7	8	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 RSM Classic top 10 picks  1. Chris Kirk - He won on Sea Island in 2013, and he's been brilliant through this six-event run of the season. 2.
13188	13188	23	23	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out.
4041	4041	16	17	target: Rafael Campos 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			GPP ONLY. Prairie Dogs  Cameron Percy $6,800  Luke List $7,600  Xander Schauffele $6,500  JT Poston $6,900  Rafael Campos $6,200  Jamie Lovemark $7,200  We have a standard field of 156 and a standard cut of Top 70 and ties so I’ll be playing all game types. This field is weak comparatively speaking so I’m going to scale back some and probably go after the weekend slate again.
6115	6115	1	1	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wes Bryan has been particularly bad over the course of the last month following his first win on tour having missed three of his last four cuts and finishing no better than 45th place. At some point I expect Wes Bryan to bounce back, and why not this week on a course that plays to Bryan’s strengths? Wes Bryan has the game to win an event like this and is going to be my super sleeper to win here  Click To Enlarge!
11904	11904	19	20	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is quite a specialised event so strong results on Florida-type courses are essential. My selections are as follows:  Tiger Woods 4pts Win 7/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim here:  Tiger Woods with Florida form of 12/2 just has to be backed for his first PGA Tour win since 2013 here at Bay Hill where he's won the title across 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013.
10937	10937	25	25	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now add in the fact that he’s finished second-first-second his last three PGA Tour starts, he’s a no brainer worth every penny of admission. Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months.
550	550	14	14	target: Henley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Houston - 2ew Reed 45/1, 2ew Finau 45/1, Henley 2ew 35/1; 1ew Hoffman 55/1; 0.5ew List 100/1
27	27	13	13	target: Huh 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WyndhamChampionship Long Shot Bets = Si Woo Kim 150/1, Reavie 175/1, Weekley 215/1, Huh 350/1
9643	9643	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A win looks imminent and the 40/1 looks well worth a play. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 22/1  There's no shortage of players who could be considered as legitimate bets this week.
8013	8013	7	7	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s had some close calls this season. Holmes was third at Royal Troon and fourth at Muirfield Village in the Memorial, the event hosted by Jack Nicklaus in June. Holmes has the distance to shorten this course and distance can help hide other errors on this long track.
6334	6334	1	1	target: DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet - $15,300    The Canadian continues to be held back by his brutal wedge play around the greens, but he otherwise excels tee-to-green and has finished T26-T10 in his past two starts. DeLaet ranks 15th on Tour in proximity from over 200 yards and 20th in GIR percentage. Mid-Tier Glue Guys    Kevin Streelman - $14,900    Streelman, coming off a final-round 64 at the Travelers Championship, has placed top-20 at three straight events.
13308	13308	8	8	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After this unfortunately things went horribly wrong for Martin and he failed to make another cut all season before losing his card and having to return to the Web.com tour last year. The good news was though that Piller bounced back well last year notching a win on the Web.com to regain his card. Since returning to the big league Martin has notched two more top 5 finishes including one at the Greg Norman designed course used for the OHL Mayakoba.
10717	10717	22	22	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why top-25s are good -- he's got four of them here in the past five years, two of them being top-10s. Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home.
7520	7520	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9500 FD: $9200  He’s got to win eventually right? Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics. Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts.
617	617	6	6	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Main targets Kisner +25 Fitzpatrick +28 Horschel +35 Knox +40 Bryan +60 Wasting $$$ on B.A.D. +40 Willett +66 Bello +66 Lee +100 CAM +125
13360	13360	2	3	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T11  Xander Schauffele 2pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€10 get £/€30 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply*. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I have had Xander Schauffele in mind for this for a while as TPC San Antonio - unlike Harbour Town last week - will be right up his street. The 2017 Greenbrier Classic and Tour Championship champion, Schauffele has been inevitably quieter in 2018 but he's still playing some excellent golf.
333	333	1	2	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Jordan Spieth — Something is just a little off about Spieth’s game right now, but it’s still good enough to finish in the top 15 most weeks. 5.
13375	13375	45	45	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Over on the Euro Tour, he’s missed two out of four cuts, but also picked up at T2 at the Hong Kong Open. Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play.
4134	4134	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau – $8,400  It’s a bombers week, so Tony Finau has to be considered especially at his reasonable $8,400 price tag. Finau has been playing solid this season with two top 5s in his last seven events. His stats line up perfectly for this course, ranking 2nd in strokes gained off the tee plus strokes gained approach.
12014	12014	1	1	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
5160	5160	28	28	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Matt Kuchar  Kuchar has played the event 11 times and his average in relation to par over four rounds is -8.1. That might not seem great, but because of that average he ranks fourth on the tournament's all-time money list.
4658	4658	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I guess it is suitable for Finau as he has finished 10th and 12th in his only attempts at this course. Finau ranks 4th in GIR%, 6th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 17th in BoB%. I will only be using Finau in GPPs as he is volatile in nature and can finish T10 or miss cut.
8742	8742	35	36	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			East Lake is always a test where tee-to-green prowess prevails and with potentially soft conditions in play for a segment of the tournament, I will happily take Rose who's certainly on a roll. RESULT: T10  Webb Simpson 1pt EW 50/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 using code SPORTS60 , T&Cs apply (4 places, 1/4 odds):  I will finish the 2016/17 PGA Tour season with Webb Simpson. Always the sort who's a true "horse for the course", it's noticeable that the Tour Championship is often contended for by players ranked in the mid-teens when it comes to FEC standing.
2968	2968	6	6	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Among other usual suspects are Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Brandt Snedeker and defending champion Jason Day. Rose sets up similarly to Stenson and would be my pick if Molinari wasn't available. I'd go on to gush more, but the reasoning would only further push you into plugging in the Englishman.
3348	3348	38	38	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This article is one in a series that uses the FantasyLabs Tools to build daily fantasy Masters scouting reports for golf’s brightest stars. UPDATE    PGA note: Dustin Johnson injures lower back after taking fall on stairs. Manager says DJ “hopes” to play tomorrow – per @AP — FantasyLabs GOLF (@FantasyLabsGOLF) April 5, 2017  In the last 12 months and over the course of 25 starts, Dustin Johnson has recorded 19 top-10 and 12 top-three finishes.
10732	10732	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
8264	8264	10	11	target: Matt Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			£100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds):  Matt Every 0.5pt EW FRL 200/1 with New! £50 welcome offer via this link:  Matt Every is showing definite signs of improvement of late and we know that he simply thrives on Bermudagrass greens. First signs of new growth came at TPC Southwind where he shot -6/64 to be first round leader, before finishing 27th.
3852	3852	15	15	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley is on a roll after a win in Houston and T-11 at Augusta National. Perez looked good at Augusta and has a good track record at Harbour Town. Russell Henley and Pat Perez.
4993	4993	11	11	target: Kirk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer is 10th in SGT2G. Emiliano Grillo - $7,800    As with Kirk, this is not a pick we would've made two weeks ago, but Grillo is coming off a solo 11th at The Players. He's a solid 22nd in ball striking, 24th in SGT2G, 46th in P4P and T56 in proximity.
13621	13621	64	65	target: Tommy Fleetwood; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) John Senden; 3) Emiliano Grillo / Kyle Stanley; 5) Keegan Bradley; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Daniel Berger; 8) Ryan Blaum; 9) Adam Hadwin / Brian Harman; 11) Alex Cejka / Tommy Fleetwood; 13) Jonathan Randolph; 14) Andrew Landry; 15) Kevin Kisner; 16) Vaughn Taylor; 17) Fabian Gomez / Alex Noren / Ted Potter Jnr / Webb Simpson / Kevin Streelman. Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Hadwin; 2) Justin Thomas; 3) Adam Scott; 4) Kyle Stanley; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Tommy Fleetwood / Francesco Molinari; 8) Ryan Moore / Trey Mullinax; 10) Jason Day; 11) Keegan Bradley / Tiger Woods; 13) Tony Finau / Russell Henley; 15) Ross Fisher; 16) Alex Noren / J.T. Poston; 18) Charles Howell III / Adam Schenk; 20) Stewart Cink / Emiliano Grillo.
11832	11832	46	47	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a risky play but at a triple-figure price he's well worth the risk and last but not least, I've thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned John Deere Classic winner, Bryson DeChambeau. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [25.0]  Jason Dufner @ [85.0]  Ollie Schniederjans @ [95.0]  Zach Johnson @ [110.0]  Bryson DeChambeau @ [130.0]  I'll be back later with the Hero Indian Open preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
621	621	3	4	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@gfienberg17 JJ Spaun, Luke Donald, Jason Kokrak
8192	8192	10	11	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s another GPP and Cash staple for us this week. Tony Finau $7,000 – Like Berger, Finau has played Quail Hollow twice without missing a cut and landing one T25. He’s another big hitter that has played quite well in major championships including a Top-10 in the 2015 PGA Championship.
12201	12201	24	24	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s ranked 18th or better on Tour in both GIR percentage and SG: Putting, which is a formula that works just about anywhere. Francesco Molinari - $13,800    Since 2010, Molinari is second to only Henrik Stenson in terms of overall scoring in relation to par at Bay Hill. The Italian is 35-under-par in his last 20 rounds at the API, including three top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the event.
3663	3663	23	23	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fitzpatrick currently ranks T4 in Strokes-Gained: Putting, slightly ahead of Donald in 8th. I mention Donald because he graduated from Northwestern University, where Fitzpatrick enrolled for just one semester, and many have drawn comparisons between the two since the start of Fitzpatrick’s career. Donald has forged a mighty fine career for himself, reaching World No.1 in 2011 and winning 16 times as a professional.
2119	2119	120	121	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan / Kevin Streelman; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Daniel Berger; 6) Martin Kaymer / Francesco Molinari; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Charl Schwartzel; 10) Keegan Bradley; 11) Patrick Cantlay / Peter Uihlein; 13) Billy Horschel; 14) Branden Grace; 15) Dustin Johnson / Pat Perez / J.J. Spaun; 18) Brendan Steele; 19) Kyle Stanley; 20) Justin Thomas. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Justin Thomas; 3) Daniel Berger; 4) Matt Kuchar / Phil Mickelson; 6) James Hahn; 7) Padraig Harrington; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Chris Stroud; 10) Brian Gay; 11) Tommy Fleetwood; 12) Cameron Smith; 13) Alex Noren; 14) Dominic Bozzelli / Si Woo Kim; 16) Retief Goosen; 17) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Peter Malnati; 19) Wesley Bryan / J.B. Holmes. Winners & Prices : 2017: Johnson 9/ 1; 2016: Watson 25/1 ; 2015: Hahn 200/ 1; 2014: Watson 33/1 ; 2013: Merrick 250 /1; 2012: Haas 50/1 ; 2011: Baddeley 100/1 ; 2010: Stricker 16/1 ; Average: 85/1.
515	515	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Doubling down on Fowler - 16/1 to win in Houston &amp; 28/1 to win The Masters. His game is without flaws right now.
3320	3320	14	14	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you really are looking for some marginal ownership spots you can expect Henrik Stenson to be lower owned than he should be as a result of his rocky play recently and WD mid round a month or so ago. With 5/5 made cuts at this event, two runner ups, and a third place finish here I plan on exploiting Stenson’s downward trend in ownership. Click To Enlarge!
12599	12599	20	20	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He recorded a T8 there in his debut in 2012, and then validated with a T16 the following year. James Hahn  Hahn is perfect in 13 starts dating back to the 2017 FedExCup Playoffs. That is a reflection of his balance both in the short- and long-term.
5669	5669	0	0	target: Justin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin won the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen in 2014. I could have easily plumped for Rose in the outright market but overcoming that defeat at Augusta won't be easy and there's always a constant worry about his ongoing back issues. As highlighted in the preview, I'm going to be concentrating on the leaders from very early on and if Rose, a notoriously slow starter, begins well, I'll be looking to get him onside but he looks a risky play before the off and he makes little appeal in this very competitive market.
6246	6246	23	23	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, in a weak field like this, you are forced to roster golfers in cash that you wouldn’t necessarily do in stronger fields. Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring.
9584	9584	13	14	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Few in the field will be playing with as much confidence. Also like: Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us.
13525	13525	8	9	target: Abraham Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List). His form is outstanding and he’s gaining a lot of his strokes with impeccable ball striking from tee to green.
10117	10117	58	59	target: Webb Simpson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			About half the field from the season-opening Tournament of Champions took a pass on the Sony a week ago, but Kevin Chappell, Jhonny Vegas, Brendan Steele, Grayson Murray and Adam Hadwin (site of his 59 last year) are all back on the links this time. The mid card is propped up by Sony holdovers Bill Haas, J.J. Spaun, Webb Simpson, Chez Reavie, Jason Dufner, Jimmy Walker, Charles Howell III, Peter Uihlein and Zach Johnson. However, we will have some star power with our first look at Patrick Reed, Phil Mickelson, Brandt Snedeker and Bubba Watson in 2018 — four of the biggest draws in the field.
10563	10563	16	16	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh. Webb Simpson, Brendan Steele and Ryan Moore line up as safety nets if you're in the same position as our resident Aussie.
2615	2615	33	33	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000. Generally, I’d go a little further down the favorites list for this pick but I think Rahm has a legitimate chance to win this week.
4150	4150	22	22	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
1217	1217	22	22	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was 10th after a slow start last year. Reed is 12/1 on the outrights and that's actually okay but removing Matsuyama, Spieth, Day and Johnson makes the task we ask of him so much simpler. He's 11/2 with the top four taken out and I'm confident this is a market he can win.
10732	10732	27	27	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
3728	3728	12	12	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a significantly better putter than the two ahead of him. When Kisner was second to Furyk here, he put on a ball-striking clinic and a similar display should see him go close once more, his focus no doubt fixed on atoning for Bay Hill and winning on what's home soil for the South Carolina man, who practices nearby at Kiawah Island. As for going win-only, again that's largely so he can share the load with Snedeker, but I'm a big believer in Kisner's ability to get it done.
12695	12695	56	56	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore has missed two cuts in only five events (WMPO and Valspar), and is a pick that doesn’t exactly fit the “bomber” prototype that tends to succeed here: he’s 182nd in Driving Distance (286.6 yards), but he didn’t play in Mexico or Hawaii which has inflated a lot of his competition’s averages. All that being said, Moore is very accurate and consistently puts himself in great spots for second shots, which will help make up for the lack of distance off the tee – he sits 16th in Distance from the Edge of the Fairway, which is a stronger statistic to look at for accuracy purposes. Moore is a very steady player on the par-4s, but he’ll need to improve on the par-5s to really have a chance to finish near the top this week; he averages 4.01 on par-4s (21 measured rounds), but 4.62 on par-5s.
439	439	4	4	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
890	890	0	0	target: Lovemark 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lovemark an obvious one at a decent price. Aron wise will always get my attention at 3 figs - stretch of 3 birds and 2 eagles in 7 holes '16
6042	6042	45	46	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We saw Kevin Streelman win here by shooting 64-64 on the weekend, including a finish of seven consecutive birdies. Relying on recent stats, the field leaders in SGP are Steve Wheatcroft, Justin Thomas, Jim Herman, Julian Etulain, Jason Day, Greg Chalmers, Kevin Streelman, Whee Kim, Brandt Snedeker, and Bubba Watson. Birdie or Better % (BoB%): There are not many weeks where we aren’t going to target birdie or better percentage because that’s what fantasy golf scoring is all about.
9710	9710	17	17	target: Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
3618	3618	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
7890	7890	10	11	target: Charl Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			These are the type of events where he shines brightest. Charl Schwartzel $7,200 – Schwartzel is coming off a T12 at the Porsche European Open last week where he racked up 15 birdies and two eagles. He’s recorded two T10’s at Firestone Country Club in the last five years The South African ranks high in the field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach the Green and DraftKings Scoring.
13264	13264	12	13	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully he’s not too burned out from playing the weekend at Augusta. Webb Simpson  Webb has contended in this event (seven straight cuts made) for years, and that’s when he couldn’t putt. Still excellent with his irons, Simpson sits second in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting over his past 24 rounds.
5820	5820	6	6	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong. But the clincher with Rose this week is how he has played on courses similar to Erin Hills. Rose was 4th at Whistling Straits, 12th at Pinehurst No.2 but the most interesting one is his Scottish Open win.
3370	3370	15	15	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although these numbers are more than likely unsustainable, it’s not out of the question that Spieth could improve upon his averages from his 2014-15 season, since he is still approaching his prime. In 70 tournaments since 2014, Spieth has produced a +3.67 Plus/Minus with 55.7 percent Consistency. His average ownership has been close to 25 percent in large-field DraftKings tournaments.
6525	6525	11	12	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kokrak could be dangerous if he gets the flat stick rolling. Stewart Cink - $14,100    The 44-year-old veteran just continues to be under-priced, despite climbing to 53rd in the FedExCup standings with 13 top-30s in 20 events this season. Over his past 12 rounds, he’s 12th among the field in SG: T2G, 11th in SG: Approach and 14th in SG: Putting.
8323	8323	11	12	target: Robert Streb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's registered two top 15s and a scoring average of 68.04. Robert Streb … The 30-year-old was in danger of losing his card until a runner-up finish at The Greenbrier Classic in early July. He added a T22 at the PGA Championship where his greenside touch was on display.
483	483	16	17	target: Shawn Stefani, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
10256	10256	30	30	target: Steele, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Embed from Getty Images  Jhonattan Vegas $7,700 – Jhonny V is in tremendous form coming off a solid week at the CareerBuilder where he continued making birdies in bunches. Like Steele, he’s gained 19 strokes on the field in the last five years at Torrey Pines. He’s another West Coast guy familiar with these green surfaces.
89	89	25	26	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our Golfweek experts are here to help, providing their picks to win, sleeper players, DraftKings bargains and more. • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Bill Haas. He’s got a nice record at the Wyndham, with finishes of T-7 or better in three of his last four years (other finish was a T-20).
1196	1196	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 - Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth. 2 - Jason Dufner, Fabian Gomez, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Aaron Baddeley, Daniel Berger, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, James Hahn, Charley Hoffman, Si Woo Kim, Pat Perez, Brian Stuard, Jhonattan Vegas, Bubba Watson.
2751	2751	27	27	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Australian finished T4 at the 2015 US Open when just 21 and although the spotlight has moved away he’s been playing some excellent golf of late. Smith finished last season with a second place at the Nationwide Childern’s Hospital Championship on the Web.com Final Series, a result good enough to regain his playing rights. That provided a springboard to the new season and Smith has capitalised with 8/10 cuts made and over $400,000 in earnings.
2457	2457	14	15	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said the Salary Vs. Vegas Odds chart brings us the likes of Jimmy Walker who at roughly 60:1 odds is only $7,000 and on the surface seems underpriced. I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different. My only concern with Walker is whether or not he can stay out of trouble on what seems to be a course that requires some level of accuracy.
10351	10351	24	24	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given his comfort in the area, I wouldn't be worried about any fatigue issues. I am considering him the man to beat this week.While Rahm brings form and area knowledge, Matsuyama is the man to beat when it comes to course history at TPC Scottsdale. In four trips, he's rattled off finishes of T4, T2, WIN, WIN!
6267	6267	19	19	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He strung together four top-10 finishes last month but struggled to maintain that form. The thing I love about Cauley is he’s gaining a lot of strokes off-the-tee and on approach shots. This means that one hot week with the putter could secure his first PGA Tour win.
10224	10224	127	128	target: Jon Rahm; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation: 1) Billy Horschel; 2) Kevin Streelman; 3) Justin Rose; 4) Francesco Molinari; 5) Rickie Fowler; 6) Kyle Stanley; 7) Hideki Matsuyama; 8) Brendan Steele; 9) Lucas Glover; 10) Keegan Bradley / Patrick Cantlay / Brian Harman / Gary Woodland; 14) Charley Hoffman / J.J. Spaun; 16) Tony Finau / Shane Lowry; 18) Alex Cejka / Luke Donald / Charles Howell III / Peter Uihlein. Putting Average (Putts per GIR): 1) Rickie Fowler; 2) Shane Lowry; 3) Jason Day; 4) Phil Mickelson; 5) Ollie Schniederjans; 6) Patrick Cantlay; 7) Maverick McNealy / Cameron Smith; 9) Grayson Murray; 10) Marc Leishman; 11) Adam Hadwin / Anirban Lahiri; 13) Kyle Stanley; 14) Hideki Matsuyama; 15) Padraig Harrington; 16) Billy Horschel; 17) Alex Noren; 18) Peter Uihlein; 19) Jon Rahm; 20) Brian Harman. Winners & Prices : 2017: Jon Rahm 55/1 ; 2016: Snedeker 18/1 ; 2015: Day 14/1 ; 2014: Stallings 250/1 ; 2013: Woods 15/2 ; 2012: Snedeker 22/1 ; 2011: Watson 66/1 ; 2010: Crane 80/1 ; Average: 64/1.
12454	12454	18	18	target: Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In reality, I think it's a mistake if he falls outside the top 6 drafted golfers this week. Rodgers has posted birdie rates better than the field in four of his last five starts and also avoided bogeys at a higher rate than the field in six straight starts. He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle.
4730	4730	30	30	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament. Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him.
9560	9560	48	49	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
1801	1801	1	2	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Jon Rahm -- An Arizona State guy, Rahm was top five here last year as an amateur. He's learned a lot about winning and contending since then, including actually doing it last weekend.
1045	1045	21	21	target: Kirk's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
320	320	2	2	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @Thomas_Pieters at 80/1 in the @WGCMexico. Pieters was second at Riviera recently and this course may share some similarities
7567	7567	35	35	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We won’t have too much exposure in GPPs just due to our more balanced approach this week, but he’s as much a lock to finish well as any player in the field. Value Plays:  Patrick Cantlay $8,100 – Cantlay may still be relatively unknown to those that don’t keep up with the PGA Tour as much as those likely reading this article. However, he’s a stud.
6004	6004	1	2	target: Jamie Lovemark, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Jamie Lovemark, $7,700  A long-hitting, volatile player with upside, Lovemark has strung together some nice rounds lately. It included back-to-back 69s on Thursday-Friday at the U.S. Open, a 10th-place finish at Memorial and an 18th at Byron Nelson.
5706	5706	14	14	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s another lock in cash or GPP contests on DraftKings. Best bargain basement option:  Jimmy Walker $6,500 – We’re going out on a limb a little bit with Jimmy here, but we like the value and likely the low ownership in DraftKings GPPs. Jimmy has already shown he can perform in majors with three tops 10’s and a victory at the PGA Championship just last year.
6620	6620	36	37	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For that reason, it’s probably wise to ignore ownership for players above $8,500: Simply take the best golfers and find contrarian plays with cheaper salaries. Some intriguing golfers at the top of the salary range are Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, and Tony Finau. Haas has been on an impressive streak of late, posting four straight top-25 finishes; his 67.5 Recent Adj Rd is the second-best mark in the field only behind Howell’s 66.8.
6588	6588	25	25	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
13666	13666	63	64	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Ryan Palmer, Scott Piercy, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Keegan Bradley, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, J.B. Holmes, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Satoshi Kodaira, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Jon Rahm, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Steve Stricker, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Jhonattan Vegas, Johnson Wagner, Nick Watney, Bubba Watson, Gary Woodland. Trends in terms of recent winners are interesting to say the very least and that's hardly surprising at a tournament where the average odds of the winner since 2010 sits at 109/1 and across the last 4 years at a staggering 167/1.
2328	2328	27	29	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The elite putting (6th), short (35th), and sand (5th) game has returned, and he’s cleaning up on Par 3s (21st) at the moment. Justin Thomas, Russell Knox, Charles Howell III & Kevin Kisner – Thomas has won two of his last four starts and almost broke through at this site last season (T3)… Knox enters with four T20s in his past five tournaments, with just a lone result outside the Top 3 in three appearances at the Honda Classic (T23 in 2016). The Scot is also seventh in Ball Striking, fifth in birdie average, and Top 25 in Par 3, 4 & 5 scoring… After being the chalk play through the West Coast Swing, many are ready to dump CH3 due to his newfound proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
10403	10403	79	80	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
6463	6463	20	20	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since then, Scott Stallings, Ted Potter Jr, Jonas Blixt and Angel Cabrera have been winners. Last season, New Zealand’s Danny Lee won a four-man playoff over David Hearn, Kevin Kisner and Robert Streb. The win also earned Lee a place in the field for The Open Championship.
2074	2074	4	5	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Do not fade them. Sergio Garcia ($9,300) – Outside of a missed cut here last year, few players have embraced the challenge of Riviera like Sergio. He is one of the absolute best ball strikers on the planet with surgical precision when he’s locked into his game, and based on the fact he just shipped the Dubai Desert a few weeks back, I would say that he’s feeling pretty good.
9093	9093	6	6	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In ten starts at this course, Casey has never finished worse than 23rd (2015) and he has posted eight top-10 finishes in that span, including a 4th in 2011. You have to go back to the Sony Open in January for Casey’s last missed cut and he has finished in the top-5 on five separate occasions since. Three of those five top-5’s came during the FedEx Cup play-offs with a T33 finish at the BMW Championship the only result dampening such an excellent run of form.
11788	11788	27	28	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Spieth sets goals, he generally achieves them. As a past champ here (2015), this is as good of spot as any to pick up that W.  Henrik Stenson ($11,600): It's been love at first sight for the Swede and Copperhead. He posted a solo fourth in his 2015 debut and has since returned to collect two more finishes of T11 or better.
13504	13504	8	8	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			More specifically, he can hack it in Texas. Suri nearly won his group in the WGC-Matchplay at Austin Country Club, but he finished behind eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Suri was the only one of seven opponents that Bubba didn’t destroy, as he was able to halve his match.
6582	6582	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has gained strokes on approach shots in six of his last seven events. There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it.
3393	3393	12	13	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts.
196	196	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bethpage is a lengthy 7,468-yard par 71 and although we have scant evidence to go on - the 2002 and 2009 US Opens along with this event in 2012 - it's easy to spot plenty of big hitters amongst the respective top 10s. Reed biffs it just a few yards short of 300 off the tee and that puts him in the top 50 in Driving Distance. He's about much more than that though as shown by his ninth spot in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green.
327	327	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
10794	10794	33	34	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Definitely two youngsters to consider strongly this week.

7160	7160	47	47	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Half a career grand slam and more than one near-miss is some return for a 23-year-old who hasn't yet played in 20 majors, so it's hard to argue with his price - especially considering the problems facing various potential dangers. Sky Bet special: Any of Spieth/Harman/Ellis/Matsuyama/Grace or Leishman to win - 6/1! Fowler, for instance, still has to show that he can put the pieces together on Sunday.
913	913	9	11	target: Si WOO Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current PGA Card: ZJ 25/1 Kokrak 35/1 Cook 66/1 Si WOO Kim 100/1
1910	1910	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 3: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m); 4: Jason Day ($11.6m); 5: Justin Rose ($9.2m); 6: Brandt Snedeker ($10.0m); 7: Pat Perez ($7.3m); 8: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 9: Jimmy Walker ($8.8m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.5m). Predictor Positives : With bad weather forecast for the opening 36 holes, you'd like the chances of U.S. Open, Open Championship and Pebble Beach specialist Dustin Johnson at $11.8 million.
12241	12241	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
1400	1400	16	17	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
12384	12384	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
5208	5208	4	4	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Picks and Sleepers  Rickie Fowler ($8,900)  Rickie Fowler is $8,900. For comparison, Patrick Reed is $9,200 and Brooks Koepka is $9,700 and are both ranked below Fowler in the OWGR. Rickie is a tough book to read.
2611	2611	47	48	target: Jason Dufner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
7520	7520	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9500 FD: $9200  He’s got to win eventually right? Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics. Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
8886	8886	12	13	target: Bronson Burgoon 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His balanced attack isn't sexy, but it and his grit have soul. Bronson Burgoon … Rest and recovery from wrist surgery sidelined him for nearly 10 months, but when he returned to action early this summer, it proved to be worth the wait. He recorded a pair of top 25s among six cuts made in eight starts in advance of the Web.com Tour Finals during which he competed on a special medical exemption.
9017	9017	29	29	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is one of the best birdie makers in the field and giving the fact that he is guaranteed 72 holes, He is a must play in all formats. Woodland turned his 2017 season around at the end of the year and will look to keep the momentum going into the 2018 season. It’s been a few years since Woodland has found success in Malaysia, but he had a runner up finish in 2014 and 2013.
11703	11703	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In three starts at this course, Finau missed his first two cuts, before finishing 5th here last season, largely thanks to a final round 64. Finau will be looking to join Woodland as a bomber to break the mould here at Copperhead and buck the trend of shorter winners getting their name on the trophy here. His missed cut at the Phoenix Open was his first of the season and his only one so far, and he bounced back with a T2 finish at the Genesis Open on his next start.
9742	9742	27	27	target: Henley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given his ranking of 16th in Strokes Gained: Putting in the early going this year, he’s a good bet to be in the mix Sunday afternoon. Russell Henley, $9,800 – Henley out-birdied Tim Clark for his first PGA Tour win at Waialae back in 2013, and since has notched a couple more top-17s, proving his win wasn’t a fluke. Henley is a strong fit for this venue given his strong balance of distance and accuracy off the tee combined with solid putting.
7803	7803	9	10	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of my lineups will have Casey on them. Adam Scott ($8,800) – Seriously, why is Adam Scott priced in the 8k range whenever there is a strong field. Scott has 3 top 15’s in his last 4 tries here to go with a win back in 2011.
10194	10194	20	20	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s accurate off-the-tee, a fantastic iron player, and one of the best putters on Tour. Although we target bombers here, Harman seemed to solve the riddle of Torrey Pines last year, posting a 9th place finish. He’s playing the best golf of his career, and I’m a believer in his talent and grit.
11433	11433	20	20	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a much deserved week off, Rahm is back and priced as the third highest golfer. WIth DJ, JT and Fleetwood creating all the buzz at the top, Rahm is getting overlooked. He only has seven tags on FanShareSports, despite his T3 finish here last year.
8492	8492	8	8	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm sitting here disappointed." Before his second place, Reed had banked a top five in the Travelers Championship in Connecticut (another course in the northeast of the U.S.) and even made an albatross when posting a top 20 in the European Open in Germany at the end of July. You get the feeling another win is around the corner and the return to New York - Reed's kind of town - could just get him over the line.
1651	1651	17	17	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA DFS T10 Model 1. Fleets 2. Hatton 3. JT 4. Noren 5. Rory 6. CH3 7. Sergio 8. Woodland 9. Hadley 10. Kaymer
807	807	3	3	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Anyone else feeling Grillo this week? I think this might be the big boys man party ive been predicting hes gonna crash very soon #ThePlayers
3849	3849	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Six starts, never has finished better than T-46. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Kevin Kisner. Runner-up here in 2015 and his game is such a good fit for Harbour Town.
1501	1501	42	42	target: Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I was counting all my money on Thursday and figuring out how it would be spent, only to watch in horror as guys went over par on Friday afternoon to completely ruin the week. I myself put way too much stock in Casey, who lost his putter Thursday going -4 SG: Putting, which is historically awful. Anyway, like I said last week it is early and we don’t know exactly how these guys are playing so I hope you went light.
3834	3834	24	25	target: Russell Henley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
13570	13570	5	5	target: Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But wait a minute. Is Hoffman the prohibitive favorite in our format? In one sense, very much so.
720	720	17	17	target: Kim. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Better than feeling bad... All the An and Kang this week with a sprinkle of Lee and Kim. #TeamKorea https://t.co/TCc8MHOJgR
11811	11811	22	22	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dufner's game fits nicely, and he has shown that with his success here over the years. In his past nine appearances here, Dufner has not finished outside the top 30 once, and during that time, he has posted four top-20s. In his past five tournaments this year, Dufner has made every cut and posted three top-20s.
3089	3089	29	30	target: Ben Crane 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week. Jeff Bergerson: Ben Crane ($6,500) on DraftKings  In weaker fields like this week's Puerto Rico Open, I love looking at our Sportsbook Odds vs. Daily Pricing Tool on our site to help me find the best value plays. One of those great values that is revealed is Ben Crane at $6,800.
5266	5266	15	15	target: Finau: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully, an off week at The Players will drive Dick Fowler, P.I.’s ownership down. Tony Finau: $7,900  Finau has played the Memorial twice and hasn’t finished worse than 11th. He arrives having finished 30th-or-better in five of his last seven starts.
12268	12268	38	39	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whether it be in the Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, EurAsia Cup or this event itself, match-play form is match-play form and needs to be taken into account. Market Leaders  Rory McIlroy (8/1)  Dustin Johnson (9/1)  Justin Thomas (12/1)  Jason Day (14/1)  Jon Rahm (14/1)  No prizes for working out the favourites this week, as they wrote themselves before the prices came out. Rory edges Johnson for favouritism thanks to his heroics at Bay Hill this past Sunday, whilst fellow former winner, Jason Day also features in the top-5.
3390	3390	18	18	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As long as he can steer clear of Rae’s Creek and any lingering demons from last year’s collapse, Spieth will make an excellent play in guaranteed prize pools this year, even as one of the highest-salaried golfers in the field. With his history at Augusta and current form, Spieth seems poised to make another run at a green jacket this year. He is off to a great start this year and is poised to eclipse the massive numbers he posted in the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.
7287	7287	36	36	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After his brilliance at the US Open, where he finished fourth, a respectable sixth in Germany just seven days later, victory in the Open de France and a very fair 10th in Ireland two weeks ago, Fleetwood is one of the hottest golfers in the field. It's hard to envisage Fleetwood not contending but I just wonder whether strong home expectations might pile on a bit too much pressure. This is a very competitive market but with five places on offer, one player that it might pay to follow at a huge price is 66/1 chance, David Horsey.
7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
12860	12860	1	1	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that. The Brit has a lethal combination of recent form and course form, and he brings an exceptionally good value.
7767	7767	46	47	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley really succeeds on the so-important par-4s both in avoiding bogeys but he’s also been excellent at scoring on them (17.93% BoB on par-4s) and hits it long enough off the tee his struggles on long approaches (above 200) won’t be that much of a factor. Thomas Pieters ($7300): Pieters has had an excellent track record at WGCs, finishing 23rd/14th/5th in his only attempts, and absolutely stripes the ball. That distance will help him make up the few times where he can get wild off the tee, and it’s really on approach where Pieters’ true talents show out.
7096	7096	38	39	target: Louis Oosthuizen, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some lists…. Top five finishers in last 6 Opens  2016 (Royal Troon): 1 Henrik Stenson, 2 Phil Mickelson, T3 J.B. Holmes, 4 Steve Stricker, T5 Sergio Garcia, Rory McIlroy, Tyrrell Hatton  2015 (St. Andrews): 1 Zach Johnson, T2 Louis Oosthuizen, Marc Leishman, T5 Jason Day, Jordan Spieth  2014 (Hoylake): 1 Rory McIlroy, T2 Sergio Garcia, Rickie Fowler, 4 Jim Furyk, T5 Adam Scott, Marc Leishman  2013 (Muirfield): 1 Phil Mickelson, 2 Henrik Stenson, T3 Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Adam Scott  2012 (Royal Lytham): 1 Ernie Els, 2 Adam Scott, T3 Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker, T5 Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald  2011 (Royal St. George’s): 1 Darren Clarke, T2 Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, 4 Thomas Bjorn, 5 Chad Campbell, Anthony Kim, Rickie Fowler  That’s 36 players if you’re counting. By region?
8830	8830	6	6	target: Garcia. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top of my list is Sergio Garcia. You may recall that Garcia won the Masters in the spring, and this will be his first subsequent visit to Georgia. That alone puts him on the shortlist as he bids to cap the most memorable year of his life, one which also saw him marry Angela Akins.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
3960	3960	17	17	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s. Koepka admitted he lost his game for a while this season but the 27-year-old came back to form by making the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play. The next test of his well-being was the Masters and Koepka proved he really was on the right track again by finishing T11, his best ever finish there.
9636	9636	20	20	target: Kisner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All three courses - Harbour Town, Sea Island and Colonial - represent good form pointers for the Sony Open. Kevin Kisner: Worth backing in Hawaii  Kisner's record here reflects his career trajectory. For years he struggled, and then something clicked as he opened with a round of 63 en route to fifth in 2016, before going one place better after a closing 65 last year.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
10777	10777	3	3	target: Griffin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt e/w Lanto Griffin at 400/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) There have been surprise winners of this event before, so why not Griffin. This is obviously a massive step-up in class but his win last year at the Nashville Open kicked off a run of good form and two weeks ago he impressed with a T12 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
1665	1665	0	1	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kevin Kisner could threaten a third @PGATOUR title at 59/1 in the #HondaClassic. Kisner is much more comfortable pu… https://t.co/QRBXPcsafI
12798	12798	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting fairways and greens right now and with an average 312 yards per drive that's the green light for me to include him this week. Day rates 2nd in my classical golf course ratings (behind only Dustin Johnson) and 11th for Scoring Average, 6th for Birdie or Better Conversion and 3rd for par-4 Birdie or Better Conversion are also key stats I like this week. Has masses of correlating course form across the likes of Kapalua, Bay Hill, Houston, Quail Hollow, TPC Four Seasons, Congressional, Firestone, Bethpage Black, TPC Boston as well as East Lake and we also know that Day has the experience to handle changing conditions this week.
124	124	2	3	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Bubba Watson 1pt EW 45/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  So the blueprint for Bethpage Black is for longer hitters who are hitting plenty of greens and who like Poa Annua. Step forward Bubba Watson whose career results look very similar to 2012 victor Nick Watney. Yes, Watson has had his troubles in 2016 (he's only 24th in the FEC standings) and after a blistering February where he won at Riviera and was 2nd at Doral, he's been very quiet.
748	748	4	5	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Kevin Na ($9,500) – If you can believe it, this is actually an event Kevin Na won back in 2011 with a ridiculous score of -23, and it’s easy to see why. If length is taken out of the equation, Na has one of the best combinations of iron play and putting in the game. He’s a great value at this price.
4040	4040	26	26	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has had a slow start to the 2017 season but I think his performance at the Masters gets him going the rest of the way. Chappell is a capable Par 5 scorer and has shown upside at the Valero Texas Open by finishing T4 here last year. His putting can be inconsistent at times which makes him an ideal golfer for your round 1-2 lineup this week on FanDuel.
1152	1152	7	7	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First 2 bets of week Knox 40-1 Palmer 125-1 #CareerBuilderChallenge
9432	9432	15	16	target: Pat Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His game travels well and he always brings a lot of confidence in windy conditions. Pat Perez ($9,400): Speaking of wind, the ASU product has the highest differential in terms of WIND performance versus BASELINE performance, since 2014. He's more than 1/3 of a stroke better per round when the wind is 14 MPH or stronger.
7822	7822	22	22	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years.
8954	8954	35	36	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The weather forecast for KL looks mixed with rain and thunderstorms a distinct possibility. Venue: TPC Kuala Lumpur (West), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Date: Oct 12-15  Course stats: par 72, 7,005 yards  Purse: $7,000,000  Defending champion: Justin Thomas (-23)  TV Coverage:  Thursday 12 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Friday 13 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Saturday 14 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Sunday 15 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Player Watch:  Justin Thomas is obviously going to be heavy favourite but he will face strong competition. There are a number of European players who might threaten, three of those are:  Paul Casey – He was on brilliant form in the second half of the season but was unable to convert and secure a victory.
2125	2125	22	23	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth, Chez Reavie, Brendan Steele, Kevin Streelman, Brandon Harkins, Rory McIlroy, Paul Casey and Jason Kokrak. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the OHL Classic / Nedbank Challenge and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events, plus the Hero World Challenge.
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
1100	1100	3	3	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: B Gay 125/1, B Stuard 125/1, W Kim 250/1, C Campbell 250/1, M Hoffmann 250/1, C Conners 300/1
4734	4734	7	7	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about his stats? In this field, Finau ranks 3rd in SG-T2G, 9th in SG-App, 5th in driving distance, 4th in Par 4 scoring, 8th in Bob% and 9th in Bogey Avoidance. Shall I go on?
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
4433	4433	22	22	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I would expect more of the same from him this week as he’s playing the best golf of his entire career. Matt Kuchar ($7,900) – Kuchar has been a little on the pricey side for his past couple events, but we now get him at a very reasonable price tag on a track that he has handled beautifully, including with a win in 2012. He makes few mistakes and like Fowler, has the right demeanor to not allow many of Sawgrass’ pitfalls to rattle him.
1234	1234	18	18	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He then had a win at The Barclays and followed that with a T5 at The Deutsche Bank. Reed also had a superb Ryder Cup for team USA winning a total of three and a half points out of five. He didn’t have the best start to the new season finishing outside the top 50 at The CIMB and WGC in China but he did bounce back with a T10 at The Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas.
396	396	14	14	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Palmer - Valspar Championship - 3ew Moore 28-1, Stenson 11-1, 1ew Horschel 50-1
5675	5675	49	49	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Knox, the 39th best player in the world according to official figures, isn't exactly setting the world alight either but his 67 in Memphis on Sunday, which saw him climb from 68th to 37th, was encouraging enough and he has the best US Open record too. In two starts, Knox has finished 45th and 23rd. Laird has four missed cuts and a 21st to his name and Ramsay missed the cut ten years ago on his only previous attempt.
2927	2927	50	50	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course has undergone regular changes in recent times and Palmer's aim was for it to play like a US Open course from the tee but like a Masters on and around the greens. As a US Open winner with a superb record at Augusta National, it's fairly logical while Rose should enjoy it so much. Speaking last year, Rose said: "It reminds me of the Memorial which happens to be Jack's tournament.
8126	8126	23	23	target: Hideki. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama ($8,800 | 11) - Sure, recommending last week's winner is dumb, but if you're playing cash games, it's hard to ignore Hideki. Matsuyama has one missed cut in 17 events on the season and ranks seventh in strokes gained: approach in his past 24 rounds. Hideki has finished 38th, 20th, and 11th since 2014 at Quail Hollow.
3631	3631	14	15	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s in nice form coming in without being too spectacular for extremely high ownership. Bill Haas 100% – We took him 100% a couple of years ago and he rewarded us with a 12th place finish. He’s never missed a cut at this event and he’s coming in playing terrific golf.
98	98	3	3	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1

193	193	63	64	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dave Tindall brings us his analysis and tips for this week's FedEx Cup opener - The Barclays at Bethpage State Park...  "As if revealing a window to his thoughts, he turned up at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday dressed like an American Ryder Cup player and his focus this week is likely to be intense." Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Patrick Reed gave the 2014 US Ryder Cup team a much-needed injection of spirit and chutzpah at Gleneagles and there's simply no way the brash American will want to miss out on this year's renewal. He heads into this week's FedEx Cup opener - The Barclays - as a bubble boy.
10598	10598	53	54	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2018 Waste Management Open field is loaded. Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley.
9520	9520	31	31	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
11998	11998	21	21	target: Grillo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils. Whilst Grillo’s form last year wasn’t great coming in to the week as a really strong iron player I had felt this was a good track for him and this was something that had was backed up by his eye catching debut finish of 17th in 2016. It was therefore gratifying to see this theory rewarded by his solid play to finish 7th.
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
10976	10976	22	23	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
8889	8889	25	26	target: Rob Oppenheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his only previous start on the PGA TOUR, he tied for 11th place as an open qualifier at the Valspar Championship earlier this year. Rob Oppenheim ... It was just two years ago when he finished 26th on the Web.com Tour money list for the regular season.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
5969	5969	43	43	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut at Erin Hills and doesn't have the look of a top-5 player at the moment, but he showed promise at the Memorial and turned in a runner-up at the Nelson. If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open.
11545	11545	59	60	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
3146	3146	12	13	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I know exactly where they are.” Jesus, Phil, calm down. Let’s give Jordan Spieth a shot to fill us in, “The grass type, the shots you’re hitting off the fairways are very similar. Lot of kind-of-slightly-into-the-grain, overseeded-type grass.
2301	2301	0	1	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Luke Donald to finish in the top-10 7/1 (BetVictor) 2pts  Donald was 200/1 to win last week at the Genesis Open, so despite his good week I am not that inclined to take him at 70/1 this week. It is important to remember that Donald has not won anywhere since 2013 (Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan) and not won in America since the Transitions Championship (now Valspar Championship) in 2012. Whilst there is no doubting Donald’s ability, he is still an excellent golfer I would still like to see more from him before backing him to win when he’s less than triple-figure odds.
12495	12495	40	41	target: Phil Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another event that may be worth looking at closely, and another event that Fowler has traded at odds-on in before getting beat, is the Phoenix Open, staged at TPC Scottsdale. Holmes is a two-time winner there, the 2011 Houston winner, Phil Mickelson, has won there three times, and Hunter Mahan has also taken both titles in the last eight years. Huge outsider, Mark Wilson, the Phoenix Open winner in 2011, was in-the-mix at halfway here three years ago and so was Graham DeLaet, who traded at odds-on in Phoenix four years ago.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
11933	11933	32	33	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 75/1, he is clearly overpriced and any sort of improvement on and around the greens could well see him replicate his performance of two years ago and hopefully go one better. Patton Kizzire 100/1 (Betfred) 0.5pt e/w:  Patton Kizzire started the season with a bang, finishing 10th, 4th and 1st in his first three events, before winning again in Hawaii at the Sony Open. Two wins already this season, Kizzire should always be looked at when a big price as he is this week.
11432	11432	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood – $10,000  All aboard the Fleetwood train…once again. Make it three straight weeks of being in on Fleetwood and I apologize for being repetitive, but when a world class ball striker is affordable and a good course fit, he becomes a “jam him in” play. Fleetwood gained 6.1 strokes on approach shots at the Honda Classic last week, something we should start getting use to.
4368	4368	11	12	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings: Wells Fargo Championship  Lock of the week:  Paul Casey $9,900 – Casey hasn’t missed a cut since January and he’s coming off a 6th place finish at The Masters. We’re targeting ball strikers this week for many reasons that you can catch by listening to Paul Tesori discuss Eagle Point on our podcast this week. Paul has been in the “ball striker” category for 10 years.
4052	4052	18	19	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he keeps up his good run of form this week he could be right in the mix. Luke List 50/1  The American has been playing well lately and comes to Texas with a decent bank of form. He had a good week at the Valspar finishing a respectable T27 on two under par for the week.
7155	7155	25	25	target: Harman's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, come the weekend he was able to match champion Rory McIlroy on both days which bodes well for his third try in the event. Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major.
8534	8534	24	24	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Making 10/10 straight cuts Brooks is a great cash play given his price and has shown the upside to win against any field. Tony Finau – DraftKings all formats – DK: $7300 FD: $8300  The price discrepancy is too much to avoid Finau on DraftKings this week. Finau has mad nine straight cuts, finishing inside of the top 50 all nine starts making him extremely viable in cash games at this price.
11789	11789	22	23	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Showing signs of life recently, I'm going to try to jump aboard before the masses jump back on the Texan. DraftKings Picks:    Henrik Stenson ($10,200): Don't have to pay a premium for the Orlando resident that has finished T11 or better in all three visits to the Valspar. Matt Kuchar ($8,200): Should see his ownership plummet after a poor putting performance in Mexico.
8187	8187	19	19	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you get a nice saving with his price falling near the average mark on DraftKings. We’ll be playing Scott in GPP and Cash contests confidently. Daniel Berger $7,700 – Berger is a bomber and is playing some great golf right now.
5759	5759	29	30	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory McIlroy (8): Starts in the opposite wave as DJ, and there is no concerns with wasting starts since Rory has been sidelined for so long. =SUPER SUBS =  Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott      Group B    Jordan Spieth (3): Has won a U.S. Open already and has some experience at Erin Hills (2011 U.S. Amateur).
13189	13189	1	1	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out. That effort at Bay Hill though was his sixth top-25 finish of the season, performing well at some correlating events.
5370	5370	30	31	target: Brooks Koepka(2nd, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is not the safe pick I would use in cash games but makes a high upside GPP play with lower ownership(4.7% average since ToC). Other notable Course History plays: Brooks Koepka(2nd, 3rd, 19th last 3 years), Chez Reavie(12th in 2015, 27th in 2013)  Top Current Form Targets  Francesco Molinari  World Golf Ranking (#16)  Vegas Odds (16/1)  Draftkings ($10,500)  FanDuel ($8,700)    He has been running hot all year and has shown winnign upside in both weak and strong field events. He started off the year with back to back Top 10's at the WGC-HSBC Champions and Shriners Open, has missed just one cut all year and is coming off a very impressive T6 at the PLAYERS Championship a few weeks ago.
1510	1510	5	5	target: Kang 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Added another in #GenesisOpen: Sung Kang @250s - 0.40pts e/w Decent record here and has popped up on a few leader… https://t.co/gOU0ieucPe
4983	4983	37	38	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
10974	10974	35	35	target: Bae 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Boasting some of the best strokes gained splits on Poa greens on tour, he arrives off a 15th last week where he gained almost all of his strokes through his approach. A previous tour winner, Bae is very capable. If he’s showing signs of getting his game back, this is one of the courses on which I’ll roster him.
742	742	11	12	target: Ben Martin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smylie Kaufman: 10th Fry's Open/MC web.com TC/MC Nationwide Children's/43rd Small Bus. Ben Martin: MC Fry's Open/MC Deutsche/46th Barclays/MC PGA. Webb Simpson: 4th Tour/24th BMW/53rd Deutsche/15th Barclays.
12822	12822	20	20	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Spieth won his first major here at the Masters, he added the US Open on his next major start. Thomas seems certain to kick on from his own first major and it would surely surprise no one were he to add a second at the very first opportunity having prepared so well for this. And now to the negative: Augusta National.
8801	8801	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!
1965	1965	13	13	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His game is solid and well suited for Pebble. My only concern with Rose is his putter, that is the main reason he isn't a cash play for me. The greens are pretty difficult on Spyglass and Pebble if you are on the wrong side of hole a 3 putt is on the table.
8415	8415	65	65	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 4) Matt Kuchar; 5) Paul Casey / Xander Schauffele; 7) Rickie Fowler; 8) Justin Thomas; 9) Sung Kang / Grayson Murray; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Daniel Berger / Jordan Spieth; 14) Jonas Blixt / Robert Streb; 15) D.A. Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 .
11172	11172	17	18	target: Scott Stallings, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His combination of strong driving accuracy and par-4 scoring making him a great value pick at $9400. Scott Stallings, $8700 – Stallings doesn’t necessarily pop as a player who fits the course perfectly, but his recent trend of three straight top-25s including a fourth last week at Riviera trump his lackluster course fit. In the last three weeks driving accuracy, greens in regulation, and putting has all drastically improved, and all these are key elements to scoring at PGA National.

3113	3113	19	20	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T15 here last year and he’s made three straight cuts coming in, including a T17 last weekend. Scott Brown ($9,800) – It’s tough for me to go against Scott Brown at this tournament. He has a win here, two T5s and a T10 in five tries (with no missed cuts).
8404	8404	32	32	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A final-round 75 at the 2012 Barclays cost him the chance to contend at Bethpage, and a level-par round would have seen him finish in a tie for 5th. Four years later, Moore returned to Bethpage and finished T7 and just three shots shy of winner, Patrick Reed. Not only does Moore have form at Bethpage, he has also shown a liking for Augusta National in the past.
10065	10065	22	23	target: Jon Rahm. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, the cut occurring after Rd 3 will mean birdies and eagles are even more valuable to take down a contest. Enter Jon Rahm. Don’t get cute.
937	937	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6. Alex Cejka - $7,300  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
9275	9275	13	14	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Hero World Challenge 2017  Lock of the week:  Embed from Getty Images  Justin Rose – $8,600 – It would be wise of you to lock in the only guy in the field with his primary residence being in the Bahamas. Insert Justin Rose. Rose has two wins, a T4, and a T10 in his last four starts since late October.
608	608	2	2	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
412	412	18	19	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Related: 2016 European Ryder Cup team  This week it’s the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston in Massachusetts. Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done.
2214	2214	2	2	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
2576	2576	13	14	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be popular, but hard to pass on his form. Tier 2  Justin Rose $9,600 – His recent form is very good. Can bomb it when needed but precise enough to contend this week.
4879	4879	46	47	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson are both two-time winners, Jordan Spieth was runner-up in 2015 before winning last year and 2015 champ Chris Kirk had a previous top five as well as making the top 15 the year before his win. So I'm naturally drawn to Kevin Kisner, who has a T10 and a T5 in the last two years. Kisner recovered from an over-par opener with 66-69-66 to sneak into the top 10 last year and in 2015 he posted three 67s and a 69 to finish just two shots behind winner Kirk.
1403	1403	5	5	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyJesusDFS Did u factor in Noren hangover?

With 18 players, you have to nail an almost perfect lineup to get a W, or even a top 10 in this week’s GPP. In an 18-player event, and his first tournament in over 13 months, how high will Tiger’s ownership be?
3973	3973	31	32	target: John Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hadwin rarely has a bad week and did shoot a second-round 69 here in his lone appearance in 2015 despite missing the cut. Finally, I'm going to throw a dart at John Peterson at 200/1. He's a born-and-bred Texan, who sits 14th in greens in regulation and 32nd for Strokes Gained: Off The Tee.
8482	8482	23	23	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That makes in-form Matt Kuchar interesting in an event he's won before, but at a bigger price I prefer the claims of Louis Oosthuizen given the potential for this event to favour big-hitters. Oosthuizen completed a career grand slam of runner-up finishes in the majors as he shared second with Reed at Quail Hollow, and that's further proof of how big-time he is despite so often proving frustrating. Indeed, his other runner-up finish this year came at the PLAYERS Championship, so while it's 18 months since he last won and seven years since his sole success at the very highest level, Oosthuizen has continued to be a factor in elite company.
1746	1746	35	35	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically he ranks 11th in SG Approaches to the green, 10th in SGP, 34th in driving accuracy and 26th in par 4 scoring. After a good start to the season and a decent record here Moore could be a big danger man this week. Brendan Steele 40/1  After winning the Safeway Open at the start of the season Brendan Steele hasn’t let up and has continued his good run of form and hasn’t finished worse than T31st in his last six tournaments.
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
4291	4291	23	24	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s risky but brings elite Tee to Green stats and should be relatively lower owned in large gpps on DraftKings given the layoff. Bill Haas ($9,500): Haas is coming in off a two-week rest and he needed it apparently as he missed the cut by a mile his last time out at the Heritage. Still, Haas has been consistent most of the season, with the RBC being his only missed cut over seven starts.
5626	5626	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’.
12736	12736	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Many will expect him to struggle overcoming the dissapointment of last year, but given his excellent mental strength, I have no doubts he can pick himself up and have a chance for the third time in four years. In an interview with The Telegraph, Rose was quoted saying “It definitely makes me more likely to win, not less likely,” Rose said. “Look at how the runners-up have done in recent years.
8367	8367	11	12	target: Robert Streb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's registered two top 15s and a scoring average of 68.04. Robert Streb … The 30-year-old was in danger of losing his card until a runner-up finish at The Greenbrier Classic in early July. He added a T22 at the PGA Championship where his greenside touch was on display.
2536	2536	5	5	target: Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			These events have all allowed Na to flourish with a game based around accuracy, and having looked in really good shape last time I can see him carrying that momentum to his best WGC finish, having done really well to share ninth at Doral a couple of years ago. Na is 25/1 for a top-five finish and 10s for a top-10, both of which look good business and the right way to go given that he has just one win to his name from over 300 starts. Posted at 1230 GMT on 28/02/17.
13201	13201	7	7	target: Cook, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This experience may well be invaluable to Cook, who will be looking for his second win of the season. At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players.
9281	9281	11	11	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is making his debut at this event this week. Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month.
12070	12070	23	24	target: Bradley/Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
8825	8825	5	5	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'll stay in the 'without Spieth' market and finish off with a punt on Webb Simpson at 33s (he's 40s with). As the each-way terms are still 1/5 1,2,3,4,5 with Spieth taken out, a top six finish for Simpson gets us in the money. From both a course and current point of view, that seems a very attainable goal.
12109	12109	8	8	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That is the obvious risk you take whenever Scott finds his way onto your roster. However, if his ball striking is back to a place where we expect Scott to be, the putter will show up on occasion and you have to take your shots with him. Scott has three made cuts at Arnie’s tournament, including a 3rd place finish in 2014.
8007	8007	14	14	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also, we have golf previews for the PGA event each week. Value Picks  JB Holmes ($7,400) – Grip it and rip it off the tee this week at Quail Hollow. With some of the renovations and re-designs, this course is going to play as a par 71 of 7,600 yards this weekend.
8679	8679	104	105	target: Kevin Na; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Paul Casey / Henrik Stenson; 3) Jordan Spieth; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Marc Leishman; 6) Gary Woodland; 7) Rickie Fowler / Zach Johnson; 9) Sergio Garcia; 10) Charley Hoffman; 11) Lucas Glover; 12) Patrick Cantlay; 13) Russell Henley; 14) Jason Day / Luke List; 16) Hudson Swafford; 17) Jason Dufner / Dustin Johnson / Brendan Steele; 20) Francesco Molinari / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka / Justin Thomas; 3) Jason Day; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Dustin Johnson; 6) Xander Schauffele; 7) Grayson Murray; 8) Rickie Fowler; 9) Jon Rahm; 10) Paul Casey / Kevin Na; 12) Webb Simpson / Robert Streb; 14) Henrik Stenson; 15) Hideki Matsuyama; 16) Matt Kuchar; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Zach Johnson; 19) Patrick Reed; 20) Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices : 2016: D Johnson 10/1 ; 2015: Day 15/2 ; 2014: Horschel 66/1 ; 2013: Z Johnson 40/1 ; 2012: McIlroy 7/1 ; 2011: Rose 66/1 ; 2010: D Johnson 33/1 ; Average: 33/1.
3453	3453	10	10	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be a great target in gpps this week. Bill Haas ($7,200): Haas is a player I’m very high on this week. He’s made seven straight cuts at Augusta and hasn’t finished worse than 24th here over the last four years.
2788	2788	16	16	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week. Ryan Moore - Ryan Moore had a top-30 finish last week in Mexico and should be able to build on that performance at Innisbrook where he’s produced top-five finishes each of the last two years. Moore has been really consistent with four top-25 finishes and missing the cut just once in seven events.
13505	13505	20	20	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Suri nearly won his group in the WGC-Matchplay at Austin Country Club, but he finished behind eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Suri was the only one of seven opponents that Bubba didn’t destroy, as he was able to halve his match. A week later, Suri entered the Houston Open and finished eighth with three rounds in the 60s.
10541	10541	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate teams are no fun and don't help anyone. FanDuel Picks:    Zach Johnson ($10,600): He's fully synced up with his latest equipment from PXG. Typically runs hot or cold, so I will keep riding the hot streak while it's here.
10724	10724	21	21	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home. He's finished top-25 here the last three years, and all that's gotten him is a $1,000 drop in price over last year.
906	906	37	38	target: Russell Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Last week I went with Jon Rahm who secured a T15 by week's end.
175	175	27	28	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Using Palmer as a cut maker with upside gives us a lot of room to work with when building the rest of our roster. Taras Pitra -- Jim Furyk ($8,600)  If you missed it on Sunday, Justin Ray of the Golf Channel put out a tweet stating "In Jim Furyk's last 95 holes, he has hit 86 greens in regulation" which equals 90.5 percent. That's an absurd amount of greens hit, especially for Mr. 58.
13519	13519	4	4	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Avoid him in cash. Grayson Murray $7,300 – If you’re looking for a bomber who can score and look like an idiot on social media, Grayson is your guy! The form is ok, but the scoring potential and length will be an asset at TPC San Antonio.
387	387	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has now finished inside the Top 15 in three of his last four tournaments including two Top 10's and a Top 5 at the Bridgestone. Like Day he was a little wild off the tee hitting under 50% fairways last week but nailed the greens at a 72% clip which ranked T6 for the week. Had his putter not failed him on the weekend(lost SG to the field on Sat and Sun) he would have been in contention on Sunday.
3853	3853	17	18	target: Pat Perez. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perez looked good at Augusta and has a good track record at Harbour Town. Russell Henley and Pat Perez. Henley is on a roll after a win in Houston and T-11 at Augusta National.
82	82	81	82	target: Seung-Yul Noh 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH OUT!!!! 2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Ryan Moore $10,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Brandt Snedeker $9,800  Kevin Na $9,100  2016 John Deere Classic DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Rafa Cabrera-Bello $8,900  William McGirt $8,700  Scott Piercy $8,500  Kevin Kisner $8,300  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Ben Martin $8,000  Jason Dufner $7,900  Billy Horschel $7,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Luke Donald $7,000  Camilo Villegas $6,400  Roberto Castro $6,000  Seung-Yul Noh $5,600  Rickie Fowler $11,700  Webb Simpson $10,200  Russell Henley $9,000  JB Holmes $8,100  Shane Lowry $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between. You can watch the Pat Mayo Hour every weekday at 3:00pm EST, 8:00pm EST and Midnight on the FNTSY Sports Network Television channel or on your Apple TV, Xbox, Roku or Amazon Fire Stick.
137	137	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes. He deservedly won Gold, but what makes me think he will continue to play well this week at Bethpage?
6965	6965	76	77	target: Rory Sabbatini; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
1865	1865	12	12	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back. Jones played in his first event of 2017 last week in Phoenix, saving his best round until last. A final-round 66 saw Jones climb the leaderboard, finishing T36.
715	715	17	17	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Valero Texas Open - 2ew Chappell 33/1, 2ew Koepka 25/1; 1ew List 50/1
3881	3881	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Horschel clearly loves this course and he’s kind of due for a victory since his last one coming in the 2014 Tour Championship. Horschel is another solid play with a chance to make 35 times your money.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
11764	11764	12	13	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Army Pricing – Use code PGA for 10% off membership! Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since.
8862	8862	64	64	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has been playing some good golf lately and I look forward to seeing him play this week. He is a guy that has burned me more times than he has helped me out in Draftkings, but I have a feeling that a lot of other people will feel the same way and hopefully pivot to someone else in his price range like Kuchar, Garcia, Simpson, Reed, Hoffman, or Finau. I wouldn't call him a "core" player but he's the kind of guy you could see at the top of the leaderboard on Thursday and beat yourself up all weekend for not playing him.
12907	12907	1	2	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			31. Xander Schauffele (+8000). The Rodney Dangerfield of the PGA Tour.
9795	9795	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s horrible, even by his standards. However, even after conceding eight strokes to the field with his putter, Finau still managed to churn out a tied-for-16th finish — his fifth top 20 in his last six starts. Finau’s flat stick has been historically worse on Bermuda than any other grass type, but he has improved on this surface each year on tour.
3326	3326	18	18	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bonus statistics: Rickie is 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 1st in Scrambling. We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice.
5385	5385	14	14	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We love the value the $7,500 price tag brings in this weak field. Peter Uihlein $7,200 – Uihlein is a total stud! He’s a bomber that excels in SG: Off the Tee and scores birdies and eagles in bunches.
4158	4158	10	11	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year.
4426	4426	43	44	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Ryan Palmer, Scott Piercy, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Keegan Bradley, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, J.B. Holmes, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Satoshi Kodaira, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Jon Rahm, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Steve Stricker, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Jhonattan Vegas, Johnson Wagner, Nick Watney, Bubba Watson, Gary Woodland. Trends in terms of recent winners are interesting to say the very least and that's hardly surprising at a tournament where the average odds of the winner since 2010 sits at 109/1 and across the last 4 years at a staggering 167/1.
6043	6043	6	7	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
9521	9521	42	43	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2018 Sentry Tournament of Champions DFS Picks & Preview  Course: Kapalua Resort- The Plantation Course  Yardage: 7,379 – Par 72  Purse: $6.3 M  Field: 34 players  Recent Sentry Tournament of Champions Winners  2013 Dustin Johnson 2014 Zach Johnson 2015 Patrick Reed 2016 Jordan Spieth 2017 Justin Thomas  Welcome back DFS golf junkies, fans, and newbies alike! I hope all of you had a happy, fun, and safe holiday season. New Years was on a Monday this year, so you all have enough time to shake off the hangover and start gearing up for the start of the 2018 PGA Tour season.
3628	3628	25	26	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cold weather means shorter shots, which seem to help level the playing field. Also, we’ve done a lot of digging, especially looking at players like Bill Haas and Ryan Moore. Players who make a lot of cuts here.
13535	13535	28	28	target: Champ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a long shot, but we are certainly willing to take a shot at this low price. Analysis: Taking a Stars and Scrubs approach with flyers on Champ and Niemann. Both youngsters that can mash it and bring loads of upside for their salary.
2189	2189	18	18	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
385	385	17	17	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here. Everything is trending in the right direction for Day.
6982	6982	24	25	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His success was built around impressive iron play and that will mean success this week – oh and he was 8th here last season. Scott Brown 1 point each way at 80/1 with Bet On Brazil – The American has had an odd year, with two runner-up finishes and another top 10 but has also missed the cut on eight occasions. Has finished 5th and 16th here in the past – like his chances this week.
10937	10937	24	25	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now add in the fact that he’s finished second-first-second his last three PGA Tour starts, he’s a no brainer worth every penny of admission. Jordan Spieth, $12000 – Though Spieth has been a bit off lately, his ability to hit greens and putt well make him a pick for almost every tournament. Spieth ranked second in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season and he’s overdue to provide a signature performance that has been missing in recent months.
11537	11537	59	60	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get much out of Sergio last week so I'm hoping I can collect a big paycheck at this week's big pursed WGC event. Let's start this week with the top 15 performers from last year's inaugural WGC-Mexico at Chapultepec GC:    Dustin Johnson  Tommy Fleetwood  Ross Fisher  Jon Rahm  Justin Thomas  Thomas Pieters  Phil Mickelson  Tyrrell Hatton  Kevin Kisner  Jordan Spieth  Sergio Garcia  Daniel Berger  Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Matthew Fitzpatrick    After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Justin Rose  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Justin Thomas  Marc Leishman  Tyrrell Hatton  Louis Oosthuizen  Francesco Molinari    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Phil Mickelson, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, and Rickie Fowler.
8524	8524	20	21	target: Chad Campbell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He may get talked up as the week goes on, that is for you to decide on where ownership lies. Chad Campbell ($6,900): I always go to Chad Campbell for salary relief and there is no reason to shy away this week. In his last 5 events he has 3 top 20’s and made the cut in each of those 5 showings.
7448	7448	64	64	target: Chez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie is consistently deadly accurate off the tee, an above average putter, and he crushes the world with a short iron in his hands (4 th from 125-150, 30 th from 100-125). He’s more known as a par-4 scorer, but Reavie is also demolishing par-3s this year (2.98 scoring average, 6 th ) and with four tough par-3s that will be crucial. Long a Chez apologist, this course always sets up well for the 2008 winner in a lot of ways – the one downside from him is his par-5 scoring (153 in P5BoB% this year).
2506	2506	37	37	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has had success in past WGC events as well as he was runner-up to Rory McIlory in the match-play event in 2015. Other: Paul Casey (first in strokes gained: tee to green last week)  Value Picks  Martin Kaymer ($7,500): Kaymer was great last week and now his price has come down past some people he was priced in front of last week in a weaker field. He hasn’t missed a cut in over a year which may not matter much since there’s no cut this week, but it speaks to his consistency which is unmatched at the moment.
10881	10881	34	35	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas hasn't produced his best stuff consistently this season despite flashes of brilliance and course form of 39-54-41 suggests there will be better opportunities down the line to play him. Main Bet: Back Martin Laird EW @ 100/1  After landing a big-each way return with 200/1 Scott Stallings last week, I did think about leaving some chips on the table and backing him again here at 100s. It's another California event with Poa Annua greens but course form of MC-66-45 isn't too sharp.
7092	7092	0	1	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4. Not that we needed it, but that was a timely reminder of how good the two-time Open champ can be on links courses and T17 in the Travelers adds to the feeling that he’s in a good place again.
1810	1810	9	10	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Brooks Koepka – $9,100  Last week at Torrey Pines, people piled up on the bombers with Brooks Koepka being one of them. He disappointed a lot of DFSers with a missed cut and now finds himself at a price with plenty of other good options right below him.
10636	10636	14	14	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With so many shiny names to pick from this week, DFS players could leave Spieth underowned. Spieth has played Pebble Beach five times, finishing 22nd, 4th, 7th, 21st, and 1st a year ago. The world's third-ranked golfer is 2nd in strokes gained: tee to green over the past 12 events but 144th with his putter.
4967	4967	11	12	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Paul Casey: One of the top golfers in the CSURAM88 Model, Casey is second and fourth with a 63.3 percent LT SC mark and 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score.
5942	5942	36	37	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To make things even more appetizing, Thomas tied for third at last year’s Travelers and will look to break through for his fifth career win, and first on the U.S. mainland. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts.
4903	4903	7	7	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a frustrating first round last week, Finau rebounded strong after giving me high blood pressure for a few hours watching him hack away on shot tracker. Finau ranks 4th in GIR% and SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 16th in BoB%. Keep loading up on Finau as he is striking the ball well as of late.
11892	11892	33	33	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The World Number 5 is in a rich vein of form and he continued that last week with 5th place at Copperhead. Despite grabbing the lead at the start of the final round, Rose struggled on Sunday, but if there's one thing we have learnt about the Englishman, it's to keep faith with him when he's playing well. Going back to 2012, here are Rose's performances in the tournament prior to the win: 5th, 8th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 22nd, 10th, 1st, 10th.
9983	9983	25	25	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's jump in and take a look at this weeks tag counts. $10K Range  The top tier is small with just five golfers but Rahm, Harman, and Mickelson lead the way in the tag count with Rahm sitting with a commanding lead in start recommendations. I will have the most exposure to Mickelson in this tier but think there is a nice pivot opportunity with Patrick Reed.
8086	8086	15	15	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kim, who even wears a Beatles badge on her golf cap, is a 29-year-old Korean. Matsuyama is a 25-year-old Japanese. So I’m not having it that he’s too young to have the most very basic grasp of pop culture.
10684	10684	43	44	target: Pat Perez; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ken Duke; 2) Ryan Armour; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) K.J. Choi; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Kevin Kisner; 7) Paul Casey; 8) Patrick Cantlay; 9) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel / Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman / Brian Stuard; 14) Brice Garnett; 15) Brian Gay; 16) David Lingmerth; 17) Jon Rahm; 18) Bryson DeChambeau; 19) Vaughn Taylor; 20) Tyler Duncan / Ben Martin. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Kevin Streelman; 3) Billy Horschel; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Chez Reavie; 6) Kevin Kisner / Shane Lowry / Pat Perez; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Scott Piercy; 11) Matt Kuchar; 12) Bryson DeChambeau / Russell Knox; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Corey Conners / Rory McIlroy; 18) Branden Grace; 19) Jason Kokrak / Andrew Putnam; 20) Austin Cook / Charley Hoffman / Sam Ryder / Gary Woodland.
13189	13189	1	1	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players. Gay has been producing some eye-catching performances this season, despite a run of three straight missed cuts, before a T22 finish at Bay Hill last time out. That effort at Bay Hill though was his sixth top-25 finish of the season, performing well at some correlating events.
10610	10610	37	38	target: Vaughn Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All the time Kirk is three-figures he is worth keeping an eye on in current form, and given his play here in 2013 I thought this could be another chance for him to finish inside the top-5. Vaughn Taylor 150/1 (StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  It isn’t just his win here two years ago that makes Vaughn Taylor an intriguing prospect but his play at this event as a whole, as well as his play so far this season. In eight starts at this event, Taylor has a win, a 10th, a 14th and a 26th place finish, against just three missed cuts.
2396	2396	11	11	target: Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus in truth, it will be an enormous shock were Martin Flores to challenge for the title, and it will be hard to get his odds to shorten up sufficiently to cash out. Though a winner on last year's Web.com Tour, Flores has rarely even contended at this level. Nevertheless, his credentials point to a respectable finish at least.
513	513	8	9	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll bet he makes it 3 for 3. Tony Finau is another big hitter whom I’d be considering for my lineup. Crooked Stick digs the long ball.
9368	9368	18	19	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Sentry Tournament of Champions (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jordan Spieth  Justin Thomas    You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Patrick Cantlay; Brooks Koepka; Jon Rahm; Cameron Smith  Driving: Patrick Cantlay; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley; Brendan Steele  Approach: Kevin Kisner; Jon Rahm; Kyle Stanley  Short: Brian Harman; Russell Henley; Kevin Kisner; Brooks Koepka; Pat Perez    Power Rankings Wild Card  16. Cameron Smith … First-timer comin' in hot.
1291	1291	4	5	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays. Scott Piercy ($8,900) – With few exceptions, Piercy has been rock solid over the past year at events far, far more challenging than the Sony Open, and I would expect his excellence to carry over well here again this year at a very reasonable price, just as he has over the past four years where he’s been inside the top 25 four out of five times, including a runner-up in 2015.
9705	9705	17	18	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As far as recent performance goes Woodland has made seven straight cuts dating back to last season. Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th.
6828	6828	25	26	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Either way his play before last week was very solid and I know he burned some people, which usually translates to low ownership. Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies.
665	665	0	0	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Billy Ho a name to watch this week at Valero: past 4 years: 4, 3, MC, 3. After MC this season: 2, 4, 13.
767	767	8	8	target: Pettersson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Have made initial bets on Webb, Haas, &amp; Pettersson due to course familiarity, but want to wait on rest w/forecast a… https://t.co/ROSZbJI7Te
8019	8019	37	37	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also, he’s played here at the Wells Fargo Championship each year since 2011 and his results have been steadily improving, finishing t-9th and t-14th the past two years. He may not seriously contend, but I like for Steele to post a sneaky top 10 finish this week. #isitThursdayyet  Joel Harrington  @joel4deepgolf
5208	5208	5	5	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Picks and Sleepers  Rickie Fowler ($8,900)  Rickie Fowler is $8,900. For comparison, Patrick Reed is $9,200 and Brooks Koepka is $9,700 and are both ranked below Fowler in the OWGR. Rickie is a tough book to read.
4652	4652	35	36	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course features plenty of sand so we don’t want our core players to be hacking away from the sand. Past Winners  2016 Sergio Garcia  2015 Steven Bowditch  2014 Brendon Todd  2013 Bae Sang-moon  2012 Jason Dufner  2011 Keegan Bradley  2010 Jason Day  Weather  The weather looks as if we could see some rain in the forecast. This will be important to monitor as a couple years ago the rain turned the course into a Par 69.
11197	11197	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is ranked 44th in driving accuracy. Stewart Cink - $6,800 (150-1)  Cink is in the odd position of going 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National but never securing a top-25 (he was T27 and T26 the past two years). So, if you are looking for a bargain-basement price with a really good chance to make the cut, Cink is your man.
5740	5740	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said, the USGA set up each year is often quite similar, so looking back at who has had success at this event over their career is at least worth reviewing. Jason Day has played in the U.S. Open six times and only finished outside of the top-10 once. He has runner-up finishes from both 2011 at Congressional and 2013 at Merion.
6292	6292	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
1682	1682	4	4	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back to the pick. Finau is another guy who really stands out in this mid-range as he checks almost every box. After an average start to the fall season(T26, T33, T41, CUT) he rebounded with a T9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions and a T20 at the Sony Open two weeks ago.
9786	9786	8	8	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside. A ball-striking and long-iron extraordinaire, Wise is better on approaches the further he is from the hole. Get him next to the green, and he’ll struggle.
7930	7930	40	40	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the European Tour he’s won three times – as recently as the Open de France earlier this summer, and has flashed the form to compete on any track in the world. Although it’s in a very small sample size, Fleetwood has been elite in terms of hitting fairways at a whopping 75.71% – but on the Euro Tour he’s been just as consistent, at 73.7% (12th). He’ll need to take that great play off the tee into Charlotte, because as great as the 26-year old has been, he still struggles with a putter in his hand.
433	433	11	11	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Arnold Palmer Invitational - 2.5ew Fowler 18-1, Stenson 9-1
7226	7226	28	29	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose. Yeah, it’s maybe too corny to happen.
11711	11711	4	4	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Next Best: Back Ryan Moore EW @ 40/1  It's been said before that Copperhead also has plenty of nods towards courses in the Carolinas. So it's perhaps no coincidence that, just like Stenson, Ryan Moore is a former winner of the Wyndham Championship and has some excellent form here. Moore has been a regular visitor since coming on tour and as well as an early T8 in 2007 and a top 20 in 2009, he's been one of the best performers in this event over the last three years with finishes of 18-3-5.
780	780	35	35	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a great record here over the last few years finishing T9 in 2013, a win in 2012, T7 in 2009 and a T24 in 2008. With home advantage and a great record here Moore could have a great week. Scott Piercy 28/1  Piercy had a bad start in China last week and found it hard to recover after an opening round 79.
3023	3023	5	5	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stay tuned! Core Players  Luke List ($9,900): List can absolutely crush the ball. The rough here isn’t as penal as we saw last weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational where the ball just stuck in the rough.
4921	4921	99	100	target: Phil Mickelson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They don't appear to correlate visually but all three venues reward excellent ball striking and short games and form at the three courses crosses over really well...  David Toms, Kenny Perry, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson and Jordan Spieth have all recently won this title and the John Deere Classic, staged at Deere Run in Illinois and Brandt Snedeker and Tim Clark have both finished runner-up at both tournaments. Johnson has won this title twice recently so of the eight men to win the last eight editions, four have also won the US Masters - Johnson, Spieth, Adam Scott and Phil Mickelson. Is There an Identikit Winner?
11138	11138	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four starts here, Scott has a win, two top-14 finishes and just one MC (on debut in 2011) so it fair to say he should be comfortable with the layout. Scott ranked 3rd for Greens in Regulation last week at Riviera, but of course did not hole the amount of putts he needs to, to go low or in fact break par. He shots rounds of 72-72-71-71 and ranked 75th out of 76 qualifying players in Strokes-Gained: Putting, which is no surprise given he ranks 203rd in that area on Tour this season.
11997	11997	37	37	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As with our first two picks this week it’s again hard not to see another big week for the Swede ahead. EMILIANO GRILLO – 66-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/5 odds 1st 7 FINISHED 26th    I backed Grillo in this event last year and he duly lead the event on day one before sitting one shot of the pace at halfway. After a disappointing Saturday the Argentinian bounced back on Sunday to deliver us a share of the e/w place spoils.
3225	3225	1	1	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Billy Horschel 50/1 (Ladbrokes) 1pt e/w  I am currently in danger of backing Horschel off a cliff this year, but such is his good play of late, I cannot ignore his chances – especially given the circumstances this week. Horschel, who never seems to lack motivation, is one of the players that has the extra incentive of a Masters place to play for this week. The 2014 FedEx Cup champion will be desperate to return to Augusta, where he posted a career-best T17 finish last year.
12498	12498	32	33	target: James Hahn. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Selections  I had a shortlist of a half a dozen or so but the only two players I'm happy to back at the prices on offer are the aforementioned Chez Reavie and James Hahn. Hahn, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, ranks highly for both Par 4 Scoring and GIR, he was 11th in Phoenix in February and he's won at Quail Hollow. He's also averaged 4.5 birdies per round over the last three months - ranking sixth for Birdie Average.
119	119	7	7	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just some sprinkles on Kizzire, Rodgers, Steele, Walker https://t.co/j6qIz4lHJy
1298	1298	30	31	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So look for players who are excellent Bermudagrass putters and who can convert birdie chances, rather than pure ball-strikers. Winners : 2017: Justin Thomas (-27); 2016: Fabian Gomez (-20); 2015: Jimmy Walker (-23); 2014: Jimmy Walker (-17); 2013: Russell Henley (-24); 2012: Johnson Wagner (-13); 2011: Mark Wilson (-16); 2010: Ryan Palmer (-15). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
11469	11469	21	21	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous. Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship to close 2017 on the Euro Tour, then opened 2018 by taking the CareerBuilder. The biggest detriment to Rahm's success is his temperament.
310	310	4	4	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
6535	6535	38	39	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also enters the week fresh off of two solid finishes in his last two starts, so it feels like just the right time to own Wagner -- especially for the bargain price of $5,300. -- Zach Turcotte  David Lingmerth  All things considered, Lingmerth might be the best overall fantasy golfer on FanDuel this week. He continues to show solid form with recent finishes of T5, T26, T21, T15 and T12, and also has a decent overall game for the Old White TPC.
1216	1216	39	40	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out. As shown above, I'm very keen on Jordan Spieth while it's hard to ignore the claims of Hideki Matsuyama. The Japanese golfer was the hottest player on the planet at the end of 2016 after finishing with four wins (Japan Open, WGC-HSBC Champions, Taiheiyo Masters and Hero World Challenge) and a second.
4077	4077	12	12	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure List make your list among value plays this week. JJ Spaun $7,800 – Spaun is a Web.com graduate, making a huge impact on the PGA Tour in his first season. He gains strokes off the tee and makes a ton of birdies.
3862	3862	7	7	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a steal at $7,200 on DraftKings. Stanley consistently proves to be low-owned as he’s not the sexiest pick around, but he has potential to land a top 10 or even win this event. Love him in cash or GPP contests.
5989	5989	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed ($9,500): Reed may not have the razor sharp approach game that Casey has but he should be a good fit this week regardless as he can make up strokes at this venue with his improving short game and putter. Reed has a boom or bust history at this event with two top-twenties and two missed cuts over his last four appearances but I’m comfortable using him here as the real American hero has only finished outside of the top 25 once in his last six starts. Kyle Stanley ($8,400): I’m not sure if Stanley necessarily has what it takes to win at this venue, but like Casey his approach game can be so good at times that a shaky putter shouldn’t matter too much.
5220	5220	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years. Haas only has seven tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to an equally priced Byeong Hun An, who has 20.
1559	1559	7	7	target: Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Genesis Fleetwood 30 Noren 40 Bradley 66 Saunders 125 Rory parlay flames out. Top 5s on the first 3. Top 20 on Saunders.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
7872	7872	33	34	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only reason I'm leaving him on the bench to begin with is because I have one start remaining. EXPERT BEN EVERILL , Staff Writer LINEUP | BENCH Jason Day  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Adam Scott  Dustin Johnson  Rory McIlroy  PROJECTED CHAMPION Adam Scott Former champion needs a kick for his season to be up to standard. Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can.
1621	1621	15	15	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In addition to last week, his form in limited starts at Torrey Pines is solid. Cauley is the only pick this week that doesn’t have a top-10 here before but he does have two top-25’s in three starts. He finished T13 on debut in 2012 but missed the cut the following year.
2108	2108	35	35	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He only finished behind winner, Bubba Watson and runner-up Dustin Johnson so he was bettered by two of the very best on the PGA Tour. In the four events leading into this event in 2014, Harman had missed his last two cuts and finished 82nd and 32nd on the two starts before that. Given the form he is in now, there is absolutely no reason why Harman can’t get his 2nd PGA Tour victory.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.
3534	3534	48	48	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ got the monkey off his back thanks to a brilliant and bold display in last year's US Open and, with the weight lifted, I expect more to follow quickly. There were 10 years between Nick Faldo's Augusta debut and his first green jacket so we can forgive Johnson for taking his time to crack the code at Augusta National. This is his eighth appearance in the year's first major and the knocks at the door are getting louder.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
1999	1999	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's showing signs of a turn-back-the-clock season with top-25 finishes in his last three starts. Patrick Reed ($8,300)  In four career starts at Pebble, Reed has finishes of T6, T7 and T13 and no missed cuts. His ability to string together flurries of birdies always makes him an intriguing fantasy option.
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!
4125	4125	68	68	target: Poston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011

6733	6733	5	7	target: Charles Howell III; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Charles Howell III; 2) J.J. Henry; 3) Ryan Armour / Ben Martin / Kyle Stanley; 6) Chad Campbell / Trey Mullinax; 8) Danny Lee; 9) Bud Cauley; 10) Steve Stricker / Nick Taylor; 12) Daniel Berger / Joel Dahmen / Charley Hoffman / Scott Stallings; 16) Luke List / Sean O'Hair / Daniel Summerhays; 19) Hunter Mahan / Nick Watney; 21) Spencer Levin. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Billy Hurley III; 2) Willy Wilcox; 3) Brian Harman; 4) Danny Lee; 5) Tag Ridings; 6) Grayson Murray; 7) Chez Reavie / Steve Stricker; 9) Daniel Berger / Wesley Bryan / Morgan Hoffmann / Jamie Lovemark; 13) Ryan Blaum / Ben Martin; 15) Charles Howell III / Smylie Kaufman; 17) Charley Hoffman / Kyle Stanley; 19) Zach Johnson; 20) Vaughn Taylor / Kevin Tway.

10425	10425	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson – $7,700  Zach Johnson has found a lot of consistency in Scottsdale. In his past three trips to the WMO, Johnson has a T10, T14 and T12. Another result like that would be perfect for a $7,700 golfer.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him.

5068	5068	20	20	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To get a golfer of that form and calibre at that price is surprising until his course history is noted: Fowler has missed three straight cuts at Memorial, but he also finished solo 2nd in 2010, and had a top-25 as well. That history may be the one thing that keeps Fowler’s ownership down, which would be an added bonus. In almost every important aspect as it relates to the course this week, Fowler is elite.
2458	2458	5	6	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different. My only concern with Walker is whether or not he can stay out of trouble on what seems to be a course that requires some level of accuracy. The other standout on this chart is Johnattan Vegas who comes in near the minimum price and is coming into the event with incredible form.
11356	11356	24	24	target: JT’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Well on this occasion I’ve decided to stick with the latter. We start therefore with an unapologetic pick of last week’s winner Justin Thomas. JT’s credentials don’t really need much explanation however there are two things to highlight that draw me to him this week rather than to say DJ the defending champion and other market leader.
2906	2906	92	93	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Sentry Tournament of Champions and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.

5805	5805	26	26	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African also has posted consecutive top-five finishes at the U.S. Open, which leads me to believe he is ready to strike again. At $7,700, Grace is a great option for a mid-priced golfer when building your FanDuel lineups this week for the season's second major. -- Erik Dantoft
2997	2997	121	122	target: Danny Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Sony Open / South African Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) John Peterson; 2) Stuart Appleby; 3) Joel Dahmen / Boo Weekley / Steve Wheatcroft; 6) Zac Blair; 7) Graeme McDowell; 8) Matt Jones; 9) Ryan Armour / Richy Werenski; 11) Andrew Johnston; 12) Hunter Mahan; 13) Ben Crane / Ken Duke; 15) Fabrizio Zanotti; 16) David Hearn; 17) Graham DeLaet; 18) Alex Cejka / Brett Drewitt / Danny Lee / Tim Wilkinson. Greens in Regulation : 1) Greg Owen; 2) Luke List; 3) Peter Uihlein; 4) D.A.
13376	13376	22	22	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play. Grayson Murray ($7300): Murray has never played this course before and on raw statistics, he looks to be a bit of a mess this week: he’s 80th in SG: OTT (compared to 40th last season), 89th in SG: APP, and 90th in SG: T2G.
1732	1732	11	11	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Football Outlook - Jeremy Chapman - Mexico 1.5ew Fleetwood 16-1, Rahm 12-1, Thomas 8-1, Johnson 13-2; 1ew Mi… https://t.co/5M5zYJSVkF
6362	6362	20	20	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has just been so damn consistent this season compared to the other options it’s pretty much a no brainer. Fowler is the clear favorite to win this week and is obviously the least likely to miss the cut. If you have to back only one golfer from +$10k, it’s 100% Fowler.
3949	3949	33	33	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s T14 in Total Driving, has been absolutely nails in finding greens (73.06%, 8th on Tour), and has an outstanding birdie average of 4.25. Given how high the ownership will be on both Finau and Steele, using Greg Owen in a stars & scrubs format will help ease the ownership burden, with lots of upside to score well on DraftKings. Owen made the cut last year and finished T65, and in 2010 finished T41.
616	616	3	3	target: Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@gfienberg17 I have Peterson circled...haven't pulled the trigger yet
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
3385	3385	26	26	target: Spieth’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2007 Masters Champion Zach Johnson, once said “You just have to be on your toes on every single putt you ever have in the Masters.” Spieth’s elite putting ability gives him an edge at Augusta. Spieth’s 17.1 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is also elite and gives him extra value, given the DraftKings scoring system. Rory McIlroy and the scorching-hot Dustin Johnson are the only golfers in the Masters field with higher LT Adjusted Birdie Averages.
938	938	1	1	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A

9590	9590	13	14	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Few in the field will be playing with as much confidence. Also like: Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us.
12707	12707	1	2	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely. I'm not sure how much credence we can give it but recent history suggests a late start on day one is beneficial as the last seven winners have all teed off late on day one.
10548	10548	19	19	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite all of the options in this deep field, what's notable is that the push is in play. Circle Matsuyama and move on. You're fine.
10810	10810	25	25	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I used this chart earlier with Reavie, but I love how it shows a golfer’s performance compared to how the field did for that round. Kuchar rarely disappoints us relative to the competition or any given round which makes him a superb building block anytime we can catch him for a fair price. Below $14,000  Rafa Cabrera Bello ($13,800)  Seems the flavor of this range is European’s lately.
8930	8930	3	4	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Knox  11. Anirban Lahiri  12. Peter Uihlein  13.
1982	1982	12	13	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
897	897	12	12	target: Sabbatini 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t believe the 250/1 on Ogilvy in Vegas is still standing. 200/1 Sabbatini very big also. Small dart at Hoge 200/1 too
8429	8429	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson: MC PGA/48th Bridgestone/6th Nordea/2nd Open. Matt Kuchar: 10th PGA/9th Bridgestone/21st Greenbrier/4th Canada  First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010. 2016 - Laird/Reed - Both AM -5/66.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
11588	11588	33	34	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finishes top five in nearly half of his starts these days. Last 4 events: 16-2-9-1  Course form: 1  WGC form: 2-17-1-1-35-1-QF-14  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 44%, Top 10: 58%    Justin Thomas  "I'm very excited and very thrilled where my game's at. I feel like I'm playing very, very well.
1629	1629	6	6	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year. This is the highest of its kind since the Tour started collecting such records in 1983.
2920	2920	34	35	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The list goes on with legitimate cases quite feasible for Paul Casey, Tyrrell Hatton and Thomas Pieters but it's G-Mac at 50s that gets my vote. I will go for an American by taking Zach Johnson and making it a hat-trick of major winners on my team this week. The former Masters and Open champ is another with some impressive history here without actually winning.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
4605	4605	31	32	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Eventually, he’s going to string it all together all four rounds, and this seems like the perfect place. If you can’t stomach those guys and still want a contrarian option, go Graham DeLaet. The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.
12886	12886	22	22	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a top 5 already, he made the cut last year shooting 2 under par rounds along the way without contending. Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance.
7023	7023	1	1	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events. There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event.
1254	1254	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And until we see otherwise, Day is still among the very best putters in the game. Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that.
11596	11596	4	4	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Mayo welcomes Deshaun Watson, Joe Theismann, Jermichael Finley, Jamie Erdahl, Greg Jennings, Matt Mitrione, Kathryn Tappen, Jamey Eisenberg and many more into the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row. SHOW INDEX 1:29 Deshaun Watson 32 Free View in iTunes  106 Clean 2018 Fantasy Football - Tuesday on Radio Row Special with Stefon Diggs and many more! Pat Mayo welcomes Stefon Diggs, Chris Rose, Road Warrior Animal, Andy Benoit, Judy Battista, Caleb Truax, and Dave Hunt to the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row.
4461	4461	45	45	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also posted a 78 in 2016 and a 75 in 2015, and 2015 was the year he posted that career-best T42 around this track. Given the form he has been in since finishing T27 at Augusta, I think there is every reason to believe Grace is ready to finally put four rounds together around Sawgrass. After opening the Masters with a 76, Grace went 74, 71, 70 to climb the leaderboard and he has not looked back since.
129	129	19	19	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
5590	5590	19	20	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
2603	2603	26	27	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
2161	2161	11	11	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But there's a lot of holes where you can make birdie." Johnson gives the impression he's only flexing his muscles at the moment and yet already the World No.3 has posted T6 in the SBS Tournament of Champions, T2 in Abu Dhabi and that solo third at Pebble Beach. "I feel like the game's in really good shape.
8314	8314	4	4	target: Li 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Across the European, Tour Li has sprung up inside of the top 10 four times in sixteen starts, pretty impressive. Coming off of a missed cut and in a price range with lots of playable options, I would expect Li to see low ownership despite his high upside. Although he missed the cut last week at the PGA Championship he only missed by one stroke, his game is still there and if Li can get hot no one should be surprised if he gets his breakthrough win.
1484	1484	43	44	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A definite no for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jamie Lovemark ($9.6m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($8.9m); 3: Chez Reavie ($7.5m); 4: Brendan Steele ($9.3m); 5: Michael Thompson ($6.6m); 6: Charles Howell III ($9.9m); 7: Luke List ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($10.2m); 9: Henrik Norlander ($6.8m); =10: Kevin Na ($8.8m) & Sean O'Hair ($7.3m). Positives: The $7.5m for Chez Reavie looks a good investment to me.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
4939	4939	24	24	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It helps obviously the experience I have had here". 71-68-68-70 last week at the AT&T Byron Nelson to finish in a tie for 27th, Palmer has been looking forward to this week for quite some time. Ahead of the Texas two week stretch last season he pointed out "Colonial is very special to me, it is the one event that I would cherish the most and I would look good in that colour".
7401	7401	20	21	target: Morgan Hoffmann– 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stay away from Chuckles this week and thank me later. DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK (Last week: Sullivan t-70th)    Morgan Hoffmann– No, I didn’t flip flop these Hoffman(n)s around on accident. Morgan missed the cut here each of the past two years and finished t-52nd in ’13, which is certainly nothing to write home about.
12082	12082	25	26	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Aussie is killing it off the tee, sticking his irons, chipping well and, as usual, missing more 3-foot putts than everyone else combined. Classic Adam Scott. He’s lost almost three strokes per start over his last three events, yet he has churned out solid finishes since the Tour moved to the East Coast (T13/T16).
8801	8801	43	44	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
473	473	24	24	target: Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Puerto Rico Open 🔥 takes: - Uihlein picks up the win - Varner with a top ten - Power with a top 20 - Flores with a top 25
2339	2339	39	39	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As of now the worst weather over the first two days might actually be on Thursday morning but that can change in an instant obviously so make sure you re-check it Wednesday night before submitting your lineups. Stud Picks  Rickie Fowler ($11,900): Arguments could be made for and against rostering all of the top four priced players this week on DraftKings but of the four Fowler stacks up the best for me. Since 2012 Rickie has made 5/5 cuts at PGA National and in 20 rounds has gone 69 or better ten times—and only shot worse than 72 twice in that span.
3098	3098	29	29	target: Garrigus. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one of the biggest hitters on the Web.com Tour last year. He checks the box in Birdie or Better % and SG: Off the Tee, much like Garrigus. The Mulli-man has missed the cut in his last two events, but he could bounce back in this weak field.
843	843	11	11	target: ROSE 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
13014	13014	74	74	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't forget he was 5th at the Open Championship and 10th at the Baltusrol-hosted PGA Championship in 2016 and I like his competitive streak whereby he isn't intimidated in the biggest tournaments. Great results across both Emirates Golf Club - 8th (2016), 3rd (2017) and 3rd (2018) and Crans-sur-Sierre - 3rd (2014), 3rd (2015) and 3rd (2017) tie in well with the last 2 winners here in Garcia and Willett, but I also like Hatton for his strong links with St Andrews as Augusta winners Tiger Woods, Zach Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia all have excellent records at the Home of Golf, as does 2016 champion Danny Willett. So getting on board the 2016 and 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links winner Hatton makes lots of sense to me at a rather tasty price.
2476	2476	8	9	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll be on at 16s. The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail.
11104	11104	75	76	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) David Lingmerth; 13) Blayne Barber / Sergio Garcia / Emiliano Grillo; 16) Chad Campbell; 17) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Billy Horschel; 19) Lucas Glover / Brian Harman / Chris Kirk / Brian Stuard. Greens in Regulation : 1) Russell Knox; 2) Tommy Fleetwood; 3) Tyrrell Hatton; 4) Billy Horschel / Alex Noren; 6) Keegan Bradley / Sergio Garcia / Martin Kaymer; 9) Dylan Frittelli / Scott Piercy; 11) Peter Uihlein; 12) John Peterson / Justin Thomas; 14) Gary Woodland; 15) Kevin Kisner / Adam Scott; 17) J.J. Henry / Patton Kizzire; 19) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Chesson Hadley / Hudson Swafford. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Jason Dufner; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Tiger Woods; 5) Tyrrell Hatton; 6) Alex Noren; 7) Wesley Bryan; 8) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Rickie Fowler / Tommy Fleetwood / Sergio Garcia; 12) Padraig Harrington; 13) Austin Cook; 14) David Lingmerth / Bernd Wiesberger; 17) Brian Gay / Patton Kizzire; 19) Daniel Berger / Louis Oosthuizen / Ollie Schniederjans.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
5218	5218	19	20	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be looking to gain form before the US Open, and what better time than to start now. Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form.
11767	11767	30	31	target: Charl Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although he did not look great last week at WGC Mexico I am not overly concerned as this course fits his style much more than what we saw last weekend. Charl Schwartzel – All Formats – DK: $7500 FD: $9800  Although Schwartzel has not seen his name atop a leaderboard in a while he has quietly been making plenty of cuts and has a great history here at Valspar. In the last two years Scwhartzel has finished T6 and won the event in 2016.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
12776	12776	78	78	target: Mickelson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Sergio Garcia; 3) Alex Noren / Bubba Watson; 5) Paul Casey; 6) Justin Thomas; 7) Tommy Fleetwood; 8) Patrick Cantlay; 9) Adam Hadwin; 10) Ross Fisher; 11) Tony Finau; 12) Brendan Steele / Gary Woodland; 14) Dustin Johnson; 15) Xander Schauffele; 16) Charley Hoffman / Ian Poulter / Jon Rahm / Justin Rose; 20) Tyrell Hatton / Jordan Spieth. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Phil Mickelson; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Jon Rahm; 5) Tiger Woods; 6) Jason Day / Alex Noren; 8) Sergio Garcia / Russell Henley / Hideki Matsuyama / Patrick Reed; 12) Dylan Frittelli; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Tommy Fleetwood; 15) Brendan Steele; 16) Patton Kizzire; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Marc Leishman; 19) Kevin Chappell / Pat Perez. Winners & Prices : 2017: Garcia 45/1 ; 2016: Willett 66/1 ; 2015: Spieth 11/1 ; 2014: Watson 28/1 ; 2013: Scott 28/1 ; 2012: Watson 55/1 ; 2011: Schwartzel 90/1 ; 2010: Mickelson 10/1 .
6830	6830	11	13	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, let’s try and cultivate some John Deere Picks! Top Tier  Charles Howell III $9,000 – I like that we can roster him a little discount from last week. He hasn’t missed the cut here since 2012, which was his only one in 7 appearances.
1033	1033	21	21	target: Kirk's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
4758	4758	11	11	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Brooks Koepka: Koepka lost in a playoff to Garcia at this event last year. Importantly, Brooks has found his form: His 67.1 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks second overall this week, and his 18.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg is third.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
12099	12099	33	33	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day. Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.
2631	2631	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dude hits his 3-wood straight as an arrow and as long as most pros hit their driver. Stenson should have no issue navigating these tight holes, raking up greens in regulation and filling the cup with plenty of birdies. Oh, his worst finish in his last six starts….T9.
11182	11182	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It won’t surprise me one bit to see Martin use his world-class tee two green game to propel himself to a top 20 finish this week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7.9K) – In this outing, the South African makes his season debut and looks for his elusive first win stateside. Louis Oosthuizen played well here last year.
5437	5437	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week. Daniel Summerhays – $7,800  We all got to see Daniel Summerhays battle it out last week, and because of that, I think there will be more people who jump on Summerhays than there should be.
13195	13195	1	1	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
10092	10092	70	70	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Picks for the 2018 CareerBuilder Challenge  Course(s): PGA West Stadium Course, PGA West, & La Quinta Country Club, La Quinta, CA  Yardage: 7,113, 7,204, 7,060 (all par 72)  Purse: $5.9 M  Field: 156 players  Recent CareerBuilder Challenge Champions  2013 Brian Gay 2014 Patrick Reed 2015 Bill Haas 2016 Jason Dufner 2017 Hudson Swafford  The Sony Open Recap  During a week when the golf wasn’t necessarily the main story, Patton Kizzire came out on top in an enduring battle of wills, beating James Hahn in a six hole playoff. The win is Kizzire’s second win of the young 2017-18 golf season and it boosted his standing in the World Golf Rankings. Less than three months ago, Kizzire was ranked outside of the Top 300; he is now number 54 in the world.
11798	11798	36	36	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith knows how to dial it back off the tee as well as avoid bogeys when missing the fairway, which is so important at a course such as Copperhead. In his 28 measured rounds this year, Smith has made bogey on only 11.5 percent of his holes (T-5). Smith is also 8-under on 43 attempts from outside 200 yards, 2-under from the rough (T-18) and great at both one-putting and scoring in general.
777	777	4	4	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on McGirt, Molinari &amp; Gay (long shot) in Wells Fargo this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
285	285	20	21	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Texan finished fourth last year and is good value to have in your team this week. Another option is Brandt Snedeker, despite being disappointing last week we believe he has what it takes to bounce back so make sure he is in your team is your and looking to take good points this week. Five players to consider adding to your team...  1 Patrick Reed £14.5M  2 Ryan Moore £9.5M  3 Emiliano Grillo £12M  4 Johnson Wagner £5.5M  5 Brandt Snedeker £14M
2484	2484	31	31	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ could make mincemeat of this course, Spieth could putt the lights out and Rory will be fresh and raring to go again after his break. It's a simple truth that Garcia has never won a major or WGC event but he does have 22 top 10s in the former and 12 in the latter. Seven of his WGC top 10s have come in this event although it's obviously been played at different venues and all are, in fact, top sevens.
12101	12101	14	14	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He came T7 here last season after his T17 finish in his debut. Kevin Chappell – $7,300  How Kevin Chappell is only $7,300 at Bay Hill is beyond me. Chappell is one of the best ball strikers in the field and ranks 3rd in my weighted stat model over the past 24 rounds.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
5203	5203	24	24	target: Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has two top-10 finishes in his last three tournaments, and he is tied for seventh with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Per our DFS Ownership Dashboard, Dufner was nice and chalky with his 21.18 percent average ownership last week when he missed the cut. This is a good week to capitalize on some recency bias, as Dufner made nine straight cuts prior to last week.
2936	2936	24	24	target: McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think these are the type of weeks when the cream rises to the top. For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico.
3516	3516	18	18	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can forgive him that. Looking at the breakdown of his stats, it has to be significant that Fowler was ranked 1st for Putts taken in both 2013 and 2014 after needing just 108 swishes of the blade each time. He was double digits under par (-10) on the par 5s in both 2013 and 2015 so he can really attack the long holes so it's just a question of limiting the mistakes.
4563	4563	26	26	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott won The PLAYERS all the way back in 2004 and hasn’t missed a cut in his last five tries. We are all well aware of Scott’s ball striking ability that can put him in contention week after week. It is just a matter of if his putter will show up or not.
10459	10459	1	1	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside. Keegan was fourth in Strokes Gained: Approach at the Farmers, trailing only Goosen, Noren and Hadley.
6025	6025	85	86	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is not a lot of water at River Highlands, but there is on that hole, where almost 40 percent of the field notched birdies last year, but almost 15 percent left with bogey or worse.Weather-wise, typical Northeast conditions are expected for the first week of summer, though there is little chance of rain throughout the four days.Greens in regulation/strokes gained tee-to-greenProximity to the hole/ strokes gained approachScrambling/strokes gained around the greenDriving accuracy/strokes gained off the tee    Past Champions    2016 - Russell Knox  2015 - Bubba Watson  2014 - Kevin Streelman  2013 - Ken Duke  2012 - Marc Leishman  2011 - Freddie Jacobson  2010 - Bubba Watson  2009 - Kenny Perry  2008 - Stewart Cink  2007 - Hunter Mahan Greens tend to run a very slow sub-11 on the Stimpmeter, which enhances birdie opportunities but also neutralizes the best putters and brings a lot of other golfers into the Champion's Profile.The track features a drivable par-4 -- always fun for golf fans -- in the 296-yard 15th to add some drama late in the round. This week demands accuracy tee to green, and that will be focused on in the key stats below.
67	67	25	26	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
5272	5272	13	13	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – The Memorial Tournament  Lock of the week:  Jon Rahm $11,100 – Rahmthreat is clearly the “next big thing” on the PGA Tour right now without a missed cut this season. Rahm currently holds a 69.59 scoring average, seven T-10’s in 14 events, and a victory! We received a message from Jon’s caddie last week before Colonial that said, “hey, I know every course seems to fit my guy, but next week at Jack’s place is perfect!” Rahm, who stands at No.4 in FedEx Cup standings, has proved in many areas that he is a consistent scorer and is able to gain strokes everywhere.
4114	4114	37	38	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2452	2452	18	19	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tee-to-green behemoth with the ability to dominate this golf course as he has so many others. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – So he shot an 80 at Riviera on a tough, windy day. That shouldn’t make him $1,800 cheaper than DJ.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
12850	12850	14	14	target: Matsuyama's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I hope it will be there at Augusta." There is also a flip-side to Matsuyama's low-key preparation. He goes into every major with the weight of a nation on his shoulders, with more media following him than probably every player here bar Tiger, and that has to have affected him from time to time.
2226	2226	1	2	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Jordan Spieth's victory at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, his ninth PGA Tour title, the field moves on to the Genesis Open. Our experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. This week's panel is comprised of Bob Harig, Jonathan Coachman and Michael Collins, as well as FantasyGolfInsider's Taras Pitra, Jeff Bergerson, Zach Turcotte and Jason Rouslin.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
10311	10311	0	1	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kyle Stanley - $14,500    Having finished his 2016-17 campaign at No. 2 on Tour in GIR percentage and 11th in SG: Tee-to-Green, Stanley’s price this week creates intriguing value as one of the field’s top ball strikers. He’s coming off a T10 at the Sony Open and has placed top-25 at the Farmers Insurance Open in back-to-back years.
3654	3654	101	111	target: Kevin Streelman; 14) Francesco Molinari; 15) Michael Thompson; 16) Kevin Kisner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Waste Management Phoenix Open / Maybank Championship and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Emiliano Grillo / Steve Stricker; 3) Vaughn Taylor; 4) Ryan Blaum; 5) Ryan Moore; 6) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Jim Furyk; 8) Brian Harman / Martin Laird; 10) Adam Hadwin; 11) Chad Campbell; 12) David Hearn / Kevin Streelman; 14) Francesco Molinari; 15) Michael Thompson; 16) Kevin Kisner; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Fabian Gomez; 19) Russell Knox; 20) Tyrrell Hatton. Greens in Regulation : 1) Michael Thompson; 2) Adam Hadwin; 3) Charles Howell III; 4) Paul Casey / Brian Harman / Luke List; 7) Patrick Cantlay; 8) Dustin Johnson; 9) Charley Hoffman; 10) Chris Kirk / Scott Piercy / Xander Schauffele; 13) Ross Fisher / Emiliano Grillo; 15) Jason Kokrak; 16) Francesco Molinari / Harold Varner III; 18) Corey Conners / Lucas Glover / James Hahn.
3019	3019	31	31	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Texas resident posted ten Top 15's that season and closed out the year with a runner-up finish in the TOUR Championship at East Lake. In 2014 rounds of 67-68-66-68 seen Lee finish second to Chesson Hadley in the Puerto Rico Open, it's worth noting he led the field with 28 birdies for the week. The South Korea native is good friends with Rickie Fowler and it comes as no surprise to me that his return to form has come on the back of the American claiming his fourth PGA Tour title at The Honda Classic.
9404	9404	7	8	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate entries are no fun. FanDuel Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($12,300): In three trips here he's finished SECOND-WIN-THIRD. That's not too surprising, given the comps that many golfers give to Augusta National.
12013	12013	13	13	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Argentine enters this year playing his best golf in a while. Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill.
6748	6748	25	25	target: Danny's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We know that Deere Run is a specialised test where players often churn out regular contending performances, so it's interesting to note the detail behind Danny's last visit here in 2015. Fresh off of a victory at the Greenbrier Classic the Sunday before, Lee was grouped with Jordan Spieth pretty much throughout the whole tournament. Rounds of 68-68-62 (a career low) got the Texas-based 26-year-old into the Final Group with Spieth and going down the last Danny and Jordan were level with the clubhouse leader Tom Gillis.
5169	5169	45	46	target: Kevin Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the U.S. Open nearing and a Muirfield Village course that he likes ahead this week, a fourth win of the season is on tap. Johnson finished third at the Memorial last year prior to his U.S. Open triumph at Oakmont.-- Bob Harig  Value picks  Kevin Tway  I think a lot of people will shy away from Tway in this field, but I don't think that's the route we should go. When looking at his past three performances (not finishing places) he's gaining over a stroke from tee-to-green as well as gaining almost a stroke on the greens.
981	981	16	17	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No action on the #SentryTOC this week, but here are my favorites: 1) Jon Rahm 2) Dustin Johnson 3) Jordan Spieth… https://t.co/BsgkBsSTFV
11511	11511	23	23	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings scoring will also be extremely important to win cash this week as the WGC Mexico is a no-cut event. On that note, Casey ranks 6th in the field in DK scoring putting him just below favorites like DJ, Rahm, and JT but at a much cheaper value. Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field?
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
11651	11651	14	15	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four career starts, he has a win and no finish lower than T20. Sergio Garcia  Sergio needs to fix his short game. Since coming stateside for the Honda, the reigning Masters champ has been Top 5 in the field at PGA National and in Mexico in Strokes Gained: Approach.
13363	13363	41	42	target: Chesson Hadley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Matt Kuchar, Kevin Chappell, Charley Hoffman, Sergio Garcia, Brendan Steele, Zach Johnson, Ryan Palmer, Luke List, Jason Kokrak, and Chesson Hadley. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
3304	3304	28	29	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson has burned DFS players in his last two outings but carries a 69.6 scoring average at this tournament over his last three visits. I also like Rickie Fowler who has figured this course out recently with two top-10s here over the past three years. Australians have a nice record at this event and Adam Scott (a former winner) could go overlooked due to his lack of play.
9537	9537	54	55	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But for many U.S.-based golf and fantasy golf fans, the Hero serves as the de facto year-ender. Key Stats to Winning at Kapalua (in order of importance)    • Putting average/strokes gained putting  • Proximity to the hole/strokes gained approach  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Birdie or better percentage    Past Champions    2017 - Justin Thomas  2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Patrick Reed  2014 - Zach Johnson  2013 - Dustin Johnson  2012 - Steve Stricker  2011 - Jonathan Byrd  2010 - Geoff Ogilvy  2009 - Geoff Ogilvy  2008 - Daniel Chopra    Champion's Profile    When we look back at the eight winners this decade, some hit the ball far off the tee, some didn't. But they collectively excelled in their short game: proximity to the hole, scrambling and, especially, putting.
431	431	1	2	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Dustin Johnson, United States -- After posting five consecutive finishes in the top 10, including victories in the U.S. Open at Oakmont and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone, Johnson has not been as sharp in his last two outings. He missed the cut in the PGA Championship after opening with a 77 at Baltusrol, and tied for 18th last week in the Barclays to open the playoffs, breaking 70 only when he shot 67 in the third round.
546	546	38	38	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 63 in SG: OTT and 68th in SG: APP but ranks 10th in Par 5 Scoring and 4th in Scrambling. Due to the separation in stats from other golfers in the range I will be using Reed in GPP's only this week. Also Consider - Jason Day  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 40/1  Draftkings - $8,600  FantasyAces - $5,550    Value play of the week!!
13084	13084	31	31	target: Hadwin, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s strange behavior from someone who hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in Strokes Gained: Putting in each of the last two years (12th in 2016; 18th in 2017). Normally with Hadwin, it’s “I really hope his tee-to-green game can catch up to his putting.” Now, it’s the inverse. His lack of distance is worrisome, but he notched a T36 in his Augusta debut last year, and with some experience on these greens, plus an excellent track record at equally as lengthy Riviera (Hadwin gained the eighth-most strokes of any player in this field at the Genesis Open), pencil in Hadwin for the low, low price of $7,200 on DraftKings.
13648	13648	118	119	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Henrik Stenson; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Emiliano Grillo; 5) Ryan Moore; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Alex Cejka / Kyle Stanley; 9) Steve Stricker; 10) Martin Laird; 11) Matthew Fitzpatrick; 12) Chad Campbell; 13) Daniel Berger / Ian Poulter; 15) Ryan Blaum; 16) Sergio Garcia; 17) Tommy Fleetwood; 18) Rafa Cabrera Bello; 19) Kevin Kisner / Jon Rahm / Vaughn Taylor.

2028	2028	10	11	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
3640	3640	58	59	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A bunch of international stars have stepped up to make up for Day’s loss: Tyrrell Hatton, Danny Willet, defending champ Branden Grace, Martin Kaymer, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Shane Lowry, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Yuta Ikea, and Hideto Tanihara have all decided to get in another event since they’re all over in the US already. Toss in some second-tier PGA regulars like Bill Haas, Kevin Kisner, Marc Leishman, Russell Knox, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Charley Hoffman, Charles Howell, Jason Dufner, Dirt McGirt, Russell Henley, and Webb Simpson, and 19 off the world’s Top 50 ranked players will be on the grounds. Team RBC has captured five of the past seven Heritage titles, while international players donned golf’s worst sartorial honor the other two years in that stretch.
968	968	3	3	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#HeroWorldChallenge Picks Reed Berger Tiger😀 I also have a Fowler exotic (parlayed him w the Rams from Sunday)
9784	9784	6	6	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s not asking too much. Aaron Wise  It’s time to jump on the former NCAA individual champion’s bandwagon before it’s overflowing with bodies. After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside.
3268	3268	1	2	target: Vaughn Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back Vaughn Taylor 1u @ [500.0]  Place order to lay 10u @ [30.0]  Place order to lay 20u @ [3.0]  Given that Herman and Points were absolutely enormous upsets, don't be afraid to take a punt at a crazy price. Vaughn Taylor is every bit as realistic as either of those were. He even won an event last year.
3523	3523	19	19	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some players arrive at Augusta National fearing the worst, others are hopeful that they might do well and contend. Casey is very much in the bracket of player who thinks he can win. It's a feeling he's had since his debut in 2006 when he turned up at his first Masters and finished T6 after middle rounds of 69-68.
481	481	14	15	target: Kelly Kraft, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
99	99	21	21	target: Hagy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1

6252	6252	64	65	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m not prioritizing it when selecting golfers this week. Here’s how the top 20 percent of golfers in Rec metrics perform:  Adj Rd Score: -1.37  GIR: -2.39  DD: -2.09  DA: -2.82  SC: -2.60  Adj Bird Avg: -6.45  A Few Names to Remember (From Comparable Courses)  Among golfers with at least five starts in our database at these two comparable courses, both Chad Campbell and Scott Stallings have been consistent, exceeding salary-based expectations in five of their six outings (83.3 percent). Campbell is not in the field this week, but Stallings is, priced at $6,900 on DraftKings and $5,300 on FanDuel.
12196	12196	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend. Yet despite playing just the WGC-Mexico since, and suffering an uncharacteristically abysmal week on unique poa annua greens which had foxed him a year earlier, Fowler is now 20/1 and bigger in a field which does not include Thomas. That's some turnaround, especially as he led the field in greens hit last time out, and on balance has to be considered an overreaction.
3394	3394	14	15	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts. With Adam, you can always take that his long game is going to be good, so for me, and I don’t know what the betting is, but if there’s value in the price of Adam Scott, that’s who I’d go with.
602	602	12	12	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Would be nice if I could see if I can fit Dufner Perez Kisner in every lineup this week.
11472	11472	6	6	target: Miyazato 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like Kodaira, the No. 54-ranked Miyazato was in the Sony but MCed. He recently tied for 11th in a tournament in Australia co-sponsored by the European Tour and won by Kiradech Aphibarnrat.
8772	8772	31	32	target: Jordan Spieth: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Path to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Rory McIlroy: Round 1: 7th, Round 2: 5th, Round 3: 3rd. 2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 5th, Round 2: 2nd, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Billy Horschel: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 1st.
12708	12708	64	65	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having won the USPGA Championship in August, Justin Thomas has now won four of his last 14 starts and if he claims his second major in-a-row on Sunday he'll move to the top of the Official World Rankings. He would have done so if he'd have reached the final of the WGC-Match Play final two weeks ago but he admitted after his loss to Bubba Watson in the semi-final that moving to the top of the rankings was constantly on his mind. That's one concern, and so is his poor Augusta record.
3384	3384	70	70	target: Spieth’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To put that number in perspective: Only 10 players in the upcoming field at The Masters have an Adjusted PPR of 28.5 or lower and three of them — Fred Couples, amateur Curtis Luck, and Yuta Ikeda — are not regular PGA Tour Players. The 2007 Masters Champion Zach Johnson, once said “You just have to be on your toes on every single putt you ever have in the Masters.” Spieth’s elite putting ability gives him an edge at Augusta. Spieth’s 17.1 LT Adjusted Birdie Average is also elite and gives him extra value, given the DraftKings scoring system.
1819	1819	6	6	target: Castro: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up at $7,000. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year.
5034	5034	36	36	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All in all, a share of 34th was by no means a disaster and it was encouraging to see him so sharp around the greens. Of course, winning twice in three starts is not easy, but Horschel went 2-1-1 on his way to FedEx Cup glory almost three years ago and even when needing time to adjust to his breakthrough win in 2013, just a handful of starts later was seen finishing fourth in the US Open. He's definitely a confidence player and when on-song there are few more reliable from tee-to-green, which is why he's compiled a strong record here, making the cut in all three visits, twice finishing inside the top 15, and even when down the field on debut finishing T2 for birdies.
9745	9745	1	1	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brian Harman, $11,300 – Despite a huge increase in salary compared to last week, Harman still shakes out as a good value on a course tailor made for his game. Harman has finished no worse than T20 in the past three years, so expect the lefty precision player to convert plenty of birdies and continue his good form. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Gary Woodland, $10,200 – Not typically who you’d think of at a venue like Waialae, Woodland has finished 6th, 13th and third his past three trips.
3087	3087	42	42	target: Brown's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished with a T18 at another less-than-driver event -- the Valspar Championship -- in which he shot -8 on the par 5's, which is something he'll need to duplicate this week if he's going to collect a big paycheck come Sunday. Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event.
3595	3595	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have noticed that guys can go either one of two ways when they take some time off, either really bad or really good. Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years.
9218	9218	11	12	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's going to be chalky at this price. -- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor.
11252	11252	24	24	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover has an even better score of 69.3, and he’s only $7,200. Cink has missed two cuts in a row and is 44, and Glover has poor history at PGA National, but they’re definitely underpriced relative to their talent. Two other guys who stand out in the $7,000 range are Charles Howell and Russell Henley.
3062	3062	15	16	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The slower/softer greens here should help and he’s simply too cheap for his talent level. Zac Blair ($6,400): Blair brings consistency this week and a lot of good play at corollary courses. He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico.
226	226	43	44	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With his strong form, history of playing well in the FedEx Cup, and his putter that can carry him through an event, Snedeker is an excellent play in tournaments this week, and you should be able to get him at a low ownership. Kevin Na ($7300)  He’ll be chalk. There’s no question about it.
5293	5293	9	9	target: Poulter’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With a severe lack of distance off the tee, Poulter’s overall OTT numbers don’t seem appealing (142nd in SG: OTT, 168th in Distance), but Poulter is very accurate (64.03% of fairways hit). If Poulter struggles on approach, he’s currently 11th in Scrambling and 3rd in SG: Around the Green overall – with a cut line below E, Bogey Avoidance will be more important than normal, and Scrambling (as shown above) plays a huge part in avoiding squares. In that same vein, he’s also 2nd in 3-Putt Avoidance although his overall putting numbers aren’t anything to write home about.
874	874	3	3	target: List, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on List, Lovemark &amp; Kaufman in Las Vegas this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips #golf
8143	8143	11	12	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Enough with the BS let’s get to some picks. Winner Section  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Disclaimer: I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Jordan Spieth. Well mostly just hate.
1761	1761	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surely the tare has to end somewhere, soon?!? $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Ryan Moore ($8.6m) and Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); Brendan Steele is unlikely to disappoint at $8.2 million. 5th (2012), 5th (2013) and 6th (2014) tell you all you need to know about his liking for this test, but his recalcitrant putter is likely to keep him away from the ultimate victory.
607	607	6	6	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
3330	3330	28	28	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This Englishman is 18th in SG: Tee to Green, 5th in SG: Around the Green, 26th in SG: Approach the Green, 36th in GIR, and 8th in Scrambling. Casey hasn’t been rolling the rock that well. However, putting has the most variance as a statistic so if the putter can get hot this weekend Casey will going low.
12855	12855	8	8	target: Hadwin’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But most of it has to do with Hadwin’s elite iron play the past six weeks. Hadwin is averaging 5.3 strokes gained on his approaches over his last three starts, good for finishes of T6, T9 and T12. And the best part, like Spieth, is that he’s putting like garbage, losing strokes in four of his past five turns.
6610	6610	9	10	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bryson DeChambeau  Top Strokes Gained: Putting (last week)  1. Robert Garrigus  2. Andrew Loupe  3.
5436	5436	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week.
7839	7839	18	19	target: Brooks Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: JB Holmes  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jon Rahm, Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka, Russell Henley  – Branden Grace, Gary Woodland, Thomas Pieters, Bill Haas, Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel, JB Holmes  Bets:  Gary Woodland 70-1 He’ll be looking to make his mark in a big event soon and this could easily be the place. He finished T17 here in 2015 and was near his second win of the season the last time he played in the USA.
12741	12741	3	3	target: @JustinRose99 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reasons to like @JustinRose99 this week: – Most birdies/eagles made at ANGC since '12  – Highest GIR% in Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 5 score to par at Masters last 5 Yrs  – Best par 4 scoring avg at Masters last 5 years  – Best score to par overall in Masters since 2011 — Justin Ray (@JustinRayGC) April 2, 2018  He may only be 14/1 this week but when we talk of the word “overdue”, nothing quite personifies it like Rose at Augusta. If I had to pick one player who will be wearing that coveted Green Jacket come Sunday, Rose would be that man. Phil Mickelson 20/1 (Betfred) 1.5pts e/w:  Mickelson is playing as well as most in World Golf over the last two months, finishing in the top-24 in his last five straight stroke-play events, including his win in Mexico.
1396	1396	25	26	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 2: Jimmy Walker ($9.9m); 3: Brandt Snedeker ($9.7m); 4: Jason Dufner ($7.7m); 5: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 6: Justin Thomas ($10.5m); 7: Russell Henley ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($8.5m); 9: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.7m). Predictor Positives: Jordan Spieth dominates the Predictor model this week with a virtual 500 point gap to 'course horse' Jimmy Walker.
3655	3655	55	56	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Fabian Gomez, Billy Horschel, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Davis Love III, Ryan Palmer, Brandt Snedeker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Graeme McDowell, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, John Senden, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Nick Watney. Harbour Town is undoubtedly a course where patience, experience and guile is rewarded.
9947	9947	35	35	target: Stuard. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That ranking of 38th in Greens in Regulation is better than it looks as well. Of the players that have played 24 rounds (how many he’s played) or more, only three players rank higher than Stuard. He is currently hitting over 74% of greens which is more than acceptable and will aid him this week.
13383	13383	12	12	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The reasons to like him this week are for his incredible rates. Murray is a great birdie-maker (4.09, T20) and has already picked up eight eagles on the year – 11th in Holes per Eagle – and even better, has dominated par-3s and -4s this season. He’s picked up birdie or better on 18% of both this season and is currently 16th(!)
2913	2913	8	8	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s 4/4 with 3 inside the top 20. Molinari is one of the most consistent and reliable golfers out there. He did have a MC a couple weeks back but overall is 4/5 with all 4 inside the top 20.
438	438	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also a former champion here, so I certainly won't talk you off of him in tournaments. Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format.
8227	8227	7	7	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts.
6958	6958	1	1	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Lee last played this event in 2015, he finished in third place. Lee is above average in each Birdie or Better category and is 36th overall in 2017. Though it’s difficult to predict, Lee is also one of the better putters on tour as he’s 36th in Strokes Gained: Putting this year.
10499	10499	8	9	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this stage, I'll just mention one pick. J.B. Holmes is a twice former winner of this title and has a couple of further top-six finishes among his record. He's always been a very streaky type but well capable of winning when in form, so last week's return to contention at Torrey Pines could be significant.
10721	10721	31	32	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key stats follow in importance. • Greens in regulation/strokes gained approach  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Putting average/strokes gained putting      Past Champions    2017 - Jordan Spieth  2016 - Vaughn Taylor  2015 - Brandt Snedeker  2014 - Jimmy Walker  2013 - Brandt Snedeker  2012 - Phil Mickelson  2011 - D.A.

11761	11761	29	29	target: Tony 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is following a very similar path to Aaron Wise who posted a 2nd place finish the week before he went on to claim his first victory on Tour. Tony Finau – $8,100 – Proj Ownership – High  Tony ranks 11th on our modeller this week. Tony ranks 23rd for Birdie Or Better Gained and 17th for Draftkings Points scored over the last 2 months in this field.
9021	9021	46	46	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The putter is his weakness, as we saw in Canada, but that's less of a concern on greens few players in this field have seen before, and it's worth noting that some of his better efforts have come on the grainier surfaces of Hawaii and Mexico. Woodland tied with Pat Perez and Hideki Matsuyama in co-leading the greens-in-regulation charts last week and seems bound to set up chances. With the par-fives here looking more scoreable it could well be that he can improve on a share of 28th without necessarily making many more putts.
12103	12103	33	33	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day. Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.
2530	2530	28	28	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake. It’s also worth noting his strong record at Crans where he’s twice been inside the top 10, while Fleetwood has contended at Fanling, in Italy and at Wentworth to further underline the suitability of this type of golf course. An in-form ball-striker with potential to really establish himself on the world stage, the switch from Doral comes at an ideal time for Fleetwood and at 200/1 he’s worth having on-side.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
6801	6801	29	29	target: Lee, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The crowd will be behind the Illinois alum who three-peated this event from 2009-2011, and comes in rested after skipping the U.S. Senior Open to catch his breath. Danny Lee, $9200 – Riding the coattails of three straight top-25s, including a third at the Travelers Championship, Lee has plenty of upside this week. He skipped last year’s John Deere but was third in his last start here in 2015.
2719	2719	20	21	target: Webb Simpson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take Dufner at 50s to rack up another success for the major champs. My second major champion this week is Webb Simpson. On the face of it, he doesn't seem the most obvious pick at this venue where he's missed the cut on his last two visits (2014 and 2016).
4874	4874	25	25	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s hit the 2nd-most greens in regulation (73.08%), sits 5th in Proximity to the Hole, and 6th in overall SG: Approach. The other concern with Stanley is if he hits the rough off the tee, he tends to struggle with his approach shot – but luckily, Stanley is a very smart golfer for as young as he is, and can play the narrow fairways with deadly accuracy. He sits 17th in overall driving accuracy (68.23%), but he actually hits the fairway a whopping 83% of the time.
4718	4718	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option  Anirban Lahiri $6,400 – We wanted to go super basement option here and give you a guy you can pair with DJ comfortably. There’s a lot of good value in the upper $6K range this week, but Lahiri is our guy in the bottom of this range. Now, if you were paying attention on Friday at TPC, Lahiri was -6 on his round approaching the 18th tee, where he then proceeded to hit 3 tee shots in the water left to miss the cut by 4 shots.
13198	13198	9	9	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
2002	2002	21	22	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vaughn Taylor has made nine consecutive cuts and is looking to channel his good vibes from last year’s victory. DraftKings bargain: Ryan Brehm at $6,700. Has made seven of eight cuts in his first season on the PGA Tour, hits it a mile and seems poised to finish top 5 at some point sooner rather than later.
851	851	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has a power game that travels well. Brooks Koepka. Has a power game that travels well.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
8835	8835	33	33	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Granted, there are others in this field who have been playing better but not always does this event go to someone who arrives on a tear. In fact, at 25th in the standings Garcia is in exactly the same position from which Bill Haas scooped the lot with that famous shot out of the lake in 2011. All things considered, Garcia looks a solid alternative to the more fancied runners after controversially sneaking into the field on Sunday night to earn a return to a course which plays to his strengths.
13668	13668	33	34	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
6732	6732	99	101	target: Charles Howell III; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Boo Weekley; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Steve Alker / Ryan Moore / Steve Stricker; 7) Spencer Levin; 8) Ben Crane / Kyle Stanley; 10) Chad Campbell; 11) Tim Wilkinson; 12) Zac Blair / Daniel Summerhays; 14) Scott Brown; 15) Nick Taylor; 16) Zach Johnson / Johnson Wagner; 18) Kevin Kisner / William McGirt; 20) Danny Lee / J.J. Spaun. Greens in Regulation : 1) Charles Howell III; 2) J.J. Henry; 3) Ryan Armour / Ben Martin / Kyle Stanley; 6) Chad Campbell / Trey Mullinax; 8) Danny Lee; 9) Bud Cauley; 10) Steve Stricker / Nick Taylor; 12) Daniel Berger / Joel Dahmen / Charley Hoffman / Scott Stallings; 16) Luke List / Sean O'Hair / Daniel Summerhays; 19) Hunter Mahan / Nick Watney; 21) Spencer Levin. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Billy Hurley III; 2) Willy Wilcox; 3) Brian Harman; 4) Danny Lee; 5) Tag Ridings; 6) Grayson Murray; 7) Chez Reavie / Steve Stricker; 9) Daniel Berger / Wesley Bryan / Morgan Hoffmann / Jamie Lovemark; 13) Ryan Blaum / Ben Martin; 15) Charles Howell III / Smylie Kaufman; 17) Charley Hoffman / Kyle Stanley; 19) Zach Johnson; 20) Vaughn Taylor / Kevin Tway.
11851	11851	15	15	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ride the wave of hot irons, and hope the short game falls into place. Cameron Smith  After an amazing run in Australia late last year, Smith came into 2018 with a ton of hype. People even were putting him in the conversation to win at both events in Hawaii.
7463	7463	39	39	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well. Watson has gone T21 and solo second over his two starts at Glen Abbey and crushed the par 5’s here in 2015 (he was an incredible -16 on them for the week). He lines up as a great risk/reward tournament play on DK.
7926	7926	65	66	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Par-4 Birdie or Better %  Greens in Regulation %  Long Approach (over 175 yards) – this will have to be an amalgamation of the 175-200 and >200 statistics. Par-4 Efficiency Above 450 Yards  Driving Distance %  The Golfers  Rickie Fowler ($10700) – In a field this stacked, it’s tough to pick just one of the elite golfers, because they all have win upside (Rahm/DJ), excellent course history (Rory/Rickie) or recent form (Spieth/Koepka). Going stars and scrubs would allow for two of these guys, but with a lot of value plays below the $7500 range available that is sure to be a popular strategy – nailing down one elite player and picking from the 8k range to fill out the lineup might be a tough pill to swallow, but it’ll lead to lower overall ownership and less chance of being duplicated.
6217	6217	49	49	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes, his short game is underestimated and at a tournament where he finished 11th in 2014 over the road at Congressional Country Club when in worse form than he is right now, I can see the Par 70-positive Horschel loving the TPC Potomac challenge this week. Result: T26  Xander Schauffele 1pt EW 50/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  I'm sure that Xander Schauffele would like to earn an invite to the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and based on his current play that's more than a distinct possibility. 14th at TPC River Highlands last week - which could have been a top 5 finish without a disappointing double bogey on the 17th - Schauffele is playing some extraordinary golf right now.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
8385	8385	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day shot an 8 on the par-4 18th in round three and that derailed his chances of winning massively. Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama. Whilst Day couldn’t get the job done on his last start, I think he has shown enough to contend again, at a course he should enjoy.
1909	1909	40	41	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . For the record, here's the breakdown of pure Poa Annua and Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  5 - Dustin Johnson. 4 - Brandt Snedeker.
708	708	13	13	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			100 to 1 bets that should peak your interest Danny Lee Cam Smith JT Poston Scott Piercy
10063	10063	35	35	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We usually don’t play the highest priced player in the field. However, given the structure of this event (everyone playing at least 54 holes), the value players we can pair up to make up for Rahm’s price, and his immense talent, he is unavoidable. Rahm also has an edge every week on the PGA Tour because his caddie (Adam Hayes) has over 17 years of experience on tour.
6588	6588	24	24	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
12892	12892	65	65	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar has finished inside the top 10 in 4 of the last 6 Masters and he really does come alive on hard and fast courses where his combination of approach accuracy and touch on and around the greens will always give him a chance. But away from the place part of the bet giving us value I also think we might see a more assured Kuchar this year after his Royal Birkdale exploits last summer. I think he will have learned a lot from that battle with Spieth and this is obviously his first appearance back at Augusta since.
129	129	18	19	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
514	514	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I will be spending 55 minutes of our 1 hr podcast telling @KendoVT how much I love Finau this week https://t.co/726ehHw8QO
7369	7369	5	6	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ will be just fine. Rory McIlroy – $11,000  What to do with Rory this week could actually be the million dollar question. He has been very bad lately, missing three of his last four cuts.
580	580	9	9	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s expensive, but looks like a great play. Jordan Spieth (10,600)  One of the odd things about this event is that we see top players at the lowest salaries we may have seen them at all year. Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week.
774	774	7	7	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@WellsFargoGolf PGA Picks Scott +1800 Berger +3300 McGirt +4000 Holmes +4000 Varner +10000 --- Reed +4000 Poston +11000 🇸🇪Porn👑 +25000
3491	3491	38	38	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be disappointed with his performance in the Match Play, where he fell to Ross Fisher in a group stage play-off, but the early exit there will have given extra rest ahead of this week. Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th).
310	310	1	1	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, McIlroy value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP… https://t.co/9OP07g5IZt
1468	1468	14	15	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If I didn't blow all my money on Berger/Finau last week, I'd place a Chris Kirk to win bet.
3660	3660	22	22	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He looks set for a bright future, but already he is making moves, with three European Tour wins already to his name. Fitzpatrick really announced himself on the world stage at the Masters last year, where he finished T7, just two years removed from his debut at the course as an amateur. One week after that debut at Augusta he was invited here, and he finished T23 when still an amateur.
4405	4405	3	3	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most certainly. However, Walker has started to regain form his past few starts. He churned out a pair of T20s at The Masters and Valero by getting his game figured out on the tee box.
7570	7570	17	18	target: Ben Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
10415	10415	35	35	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His results profile also stacks up well with both Hideki Matsuyama and Brooks Koepka, who have won the 3 titles played here since the re-design. From last year think Erin Hills and Quail Hollow where Thomas fired a U.S Open record low -10/62 on his way to 9th behind Brooks and fended off Hideki amongst others in North Carolina to win the PGA Championship. Wins at TPC Kuala Lumpur (2015/16) a victory at Kapalua (2017) and a top-3 in California at Silverado marry up well with both Matsuyama and Koepka.
12657	12657	20	22	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Additionally, he has experienced plenty of success in Houston, making five of six cuts since 2012, with four Top-15 finishes. Charles Howell III  In the year of players who never win hosting a novelty check, maybe CH3 is next? He has gained at least 3.8 strokes tee-to-green in each of last six events, good for a fifth-place rank against the field in that span.
416	416	42	43	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Picks for this week:  USA 1: Rickie Fowler – Rickie is now relying on a pick for the Ryder Cup, which he is probably in good standing for, however a victory this week would guarantee his ticket to Hazeltine. USA 2: Patrick Reed – I’ve always felt the Texan has a game to match anyone in the world and, after his win last week, maybe this could be his time. Winning back-to-back doesn’t happen very often, but it seems to happen more in the Playoffs than at any other time of the year, there has been five back-to-back winners in FedEx Cup history – the last was Billy Horschel in 2014 who won the BMW then Tour Championship.
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
507	507	22	22	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			plan for SHO is hit up few 40/50-1 guys and bunch of 200+ Flores (7th in GIR) 200-1 Ogilvy 250-1 Peterson 250-1 Cauley 200-1 Castro 275-1
11063	11063	35	36	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given Palmer has form at the Pheonix, the missed-cut doesn’t look great but rounds of 71/72 are never poor and I still believe there is plenty to work from. The one thing we know about Brian Harman is he will find greens. Seemingly never out of the top-10 in that particular stat, his missed-cut at the Farmers stopped an impressive run of five top-10s and a top-20, his claims boosted further with that 4th at the Sony (opened 65/68).
2350	2350	13	14	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take the South African with odds of +4000 given his current form. Adam Scott - Adam Scott is the overall favorite to win the Honda Classic, but you can still fetch him with odds of +1100. Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open.
1098	1098	15	15	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I would recommend utilizing Swafford mostly for cash-game purposes this week. Zach Turcotte -- Billy Horschel ($8,600)  After playing a relaxed schedule last season, Horschel returned to the Tour this fall and promptly missed the cut a week ago in Mexico. Although it has been a number of years since his last stop in Sea Island, his game should fit well in this event.
8422	8422	4	4	target: Zach 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safe to say that Zach will not want to miss out this year, so a top finish at an event where he finished 4th on the Par 70 at Plainfield as recently as 2 years ago is an absolute must this week, especially as he'll struggle to finish top 10 at the bomber's paradise which is TPC Boston next week. Asked about his game after finishing 5th at the John Deere Classic, he answered, "I know my game is trending. I have been saying that for a while, but I know it's trending.
9321	9321	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They're so grainy." Fowler was second for Strokes Gained: Putting in 2017, 40 places in front of Spieth, and he's very comfortable on these Bermuda greens. Take him at 7/1.
8163	8163	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler has been on the precipice all season long, and he'll be licking his chops at having his final chance for a major this season at a course he plays so well. Brooks Koepka (DK: $9,200, FD: $8,600)    When we talk about guys who are long off the tee, we have to include Koepka. He's a type of player that I always target in majors and has gained the most strokes against the field in majors over the past two years.
5077	5077	43	43	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first round W/Ds to his history, he hasn’t missed the cut here going back to 2008. There’s not a lot to dislike about Mickelson for cheap, and paired with Fleetwood he leaves a lot of room up top. Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason.
6862	6862	15	16	target: Michael Kim, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bets:  Kyle Stanley, 2 points win @ 26.0  Brian Harman, 1.5 points win @ 17.5  Michael Kim, 0.5 win @ 121.0  *My preview will feature episode 48 of the Matchbook Betting Podcast to be released Wednesday evening He ranks in the top 15% of the field for both Strokes Gained: Putting and Par Breakers and if he can keep his strong finishing form from last week running into this, he could well outrun his three figure odds in this weak field. However, it is his improving form line over the past six weeks (MC-69-35-29) plus a weekend finish of 69-67 at last week’s Greenbrier which most raises my interest.
3961	3961	38	38	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Koepka admitted he lost his game for a while this season but the 27-year-old came back to form by making the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play. The next test of his well-being was the Masters and Koepka proved he really was on the right track again by finishing T11, his best ever finish there. It came courtesy of a closing 69 so he would have left Augusta National feeling pleased but with a feeling that there was still more to come, especially as he doubled the 17th in round four which denied him a top 10.
13200	13200	25	25	target: Cook, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley was previously Brian Gay’s caddie, and was so when Gay won here by ten strokes in 2009. This experience may well be invaluable to Cook, who will be looking for his second win of the season. At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut.
8996	8996	1	1	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $12300 FD: $10500  Despite the high price tag it is incredibly hard to go against Thomas this week. Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
7177	7177	7	7	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
4676	4676	16	17	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf: Top DraftKings Picks for the AT&T Byron Nelson  May 16, 2017 Dustin Diez  Sharelines Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka headline our top #DraftKings picks at the Byron Nelson. #fantasygolf  Most of the world's best golfers will take this week off after The Players Championship, but there are still some very nice anchors for your DraftKings lineups at the AT&T Byron Nelson. Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, and Jordan Spieth headline the event; after that, it's a pretty big drop off.
13093	13093	1	1	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But Scott’s ability to get to the green is slowly returning to an elite level, and that’s what we should all care about this week. Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
6384	6384	13	13	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is putting together one of the best statistical seasons of his career. Fowler is gaining twice as many strokes on approach as he did last year and comes in with great form as well. He has made 9-of-10 cuts.
1066	1066	6	6	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
1299	1299	80	80	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Cameron Smith; 3) Marc Leishman; 4) Kevin Kisner; 5) Jordan Spieth; 6) Wesley Bryan; 7) Ollie Schniederjans; 8) Daniel Berger / Zach Johnson; 10) Kyle Stanley; 11) Chris Stroud; 12) Kevin Na / Peter Uihlein; 14) Brian Gay; 15) Luke Donald; 16) Tony Finau / Ben Martin; 18) Russell Henley / Chez Reavie; 20) Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices : 2017: Justin Thomas 14/1 ; 2016: Gomez 100/1 ; 2015: Walker 18/1 ; 2014: Walker 40/1 ; 2013: Henley 100/1 ; 2012: Wagner 125/1 ; 2011: Wilson 80/1 ; 2010: Palmer 250/1 ;. Average: 91/1.
13519	13519	4	5	target: Grayson Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Avoid him in cash. Grayson Murray $7,300 – If you’re looking for a bomber who can score and look like an idiot on social media, Grayson is your guy! The form is ok, but the scoring potential and length will be an asset at TPC San Antonio.
10088	10088	26	27	target: Ben Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His birdie or better rank is right in the middle, but he’s coming off a performance at Kapalua where he dropped 20 birdies for the week. Ben Martin ($6,900) – Ben Martin is my sleeper pick for the week, although, some other DFS players may be on to him after his T 7 finish last week in the Sony Open. Martin has shot in the 60s for seven straight competitive rounds; nothing to sneeze at regardless of the course difficulty.
11206	11206	42	43	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
1190	1190	53	54	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Jim Herman; 3) Brian Stuard; 4) James Hahn / Russell Knox / Brendan Steele; 7) William McGirt; 8) Hideki Matsuyama / Bubba Watson; 10) Billy Hurley III; 11) Si Woo Kim; 12) Jhonattan Vegas. Greens in Regulation : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Russell Knox; 3) Brendan Steele; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Branden Grace / Bubba Watson; 8) Justin Thomas / Jhonattan Vegas; 10) Daniel Berger; 11) William McGirt; 12) Ryan Moore. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Pat Perez; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Ryan Moore; 5) Russell Knox; 6) Patrick Reed; 7) Dustin Johnson; 8) Daniel Berger; 9) Brandt Snedeker; 10) Cody Gribble; 11) Si Woo Kim; 16) Branden Grace.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10940	10940	48	48	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players who can consistently hit it in position to capitalize on the easier holes and avoid big numbers on tougher holes with good scrambling will put themselves in the hunt for victory. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Dustin Johnson, $12900 – There simply isn’t a better option than DJ this week, it’s not even close. Not only is he defending champion, his impeccable record includes six top-4 finishes in 10 career starts.
5021	5021	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite having missed the cut here last year, Martin Laird does have two top ten finishes at this event in his five made cuts in his last six tries. I won’t be going all-in but I don’t hate the way vegas has priced Laird’s odds and it certainly makes for a relatively inexpensive golfer with real upside. Click To Enlarge!
416	416	7	7	target: Merritt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First @APinv bet is @TROYMERRITT_PGA at 469/1. Merritt is a @PGATOUR winner and should enjoy his Bay Hill return where he was 3rd last year
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week. Yahoo!
6772	6772	21	21	target: Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Accurate off the tee, he ticks plenty of the right boxes this week and that has shown up in past performances. Reavie is 5/6 in cuts made at TPC Deere Run and finished T5 in 2009. The 35-year-old has struggled with injuries in recent seasons but he’s healthy again and playing some good golf.
13246	13246	15	15	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His short game rankings are good as well, which is a strong combination." No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head.
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
12540	12540	5	5	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			in 2013 and 2011 respectively. Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price.
3537	3537	41	41	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He still has to clean up the errors to find that sweet spot from +6 and +10 but he's getting better each year and on this season's evidence he can do it and find that perfect balance between attack and defence. Johnson was 145th in Bogey Avoidance for the season as a young buck in 2011, still 65th in 2014 but he improved to 15th last year and is now 5th. Perhaps the best evidence, though, is that he showed his ability to avoid errors when winning last year's US Open.
3987	3987	22	22	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
5807	5807	27	27	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			By comparison, a three-way T3 in a Playoffs event is worth 580 points, which means there's a margin of error for the big boys in that series. Fowler will resonate as a short-lister again only at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational, but with no cut and another deep field at our fingertips in that event, he's worth the plunge now. I wouldn't pretend to steer you away from the trio for whom the case is open-and-shut for money leaguers, but have a plan for the Playoffs regardless of your decision.
604	604	28	28	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is a lot riding on Kim’s putter remaining hot, because his 66 percent Rec GIR is among the worst in the field. Rec Adj Birdies: 17.7, Emiliano Grillo ($6,900)  Grillo’s Rec Adj Round Score of 68.2 is tied with Kim’s for the highest in this range of salaries. Grillo started the playoffs strong with a second-place finish at The Barclays, but he hasn’t cracked the top 30 since.
8989	8989	24	24	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some guys are consistent, some are not, Pieters falls into the second category and he could see suppressed ownership because of recent results. Wesley Bryan – DK: $6800 FD: $5200  He is not much of a birdie maker but Bryan is underpriced based on ability and is a sneaky course fit. In his short PGA career, Bryan has found success on short, easy golf courses.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship
7282	7282	112	112	target: Justin's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lee Westwood was a distant second to Louis Oosthuizen at St Andrews back in 2010 and Ian Poulter chased home Padraig Harrington here at this year's venue, Royal Birkdale, two years earlier, but that's as close as any Englishman has come to getting their hands on the Claret jug since Sir Nick Faldo won it for a third time way back in 1992. I'm not so hot on Casey, who tends to throw away golden chances to win in much smaller events than this but Rose and Fleetwood have very strong claims and they're hard to oppose. Incredibly, given what a huge talent he is, and given he's a great links player, Justin's best performance in an Open Championship remains his tied fourth as an amateur way back in 1998, courtesy of this brilliant shot at the 72nd hole.

10954	10954	39	40	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Targeting a multitude of mid-tier golfers might be a better choice, as strong plays like Branden Grace, Tommy Fleetwood, Alex Noren and Marc Leishman can all be had for less than $10,000. Other strong targets for this format include Paul Casey, Branden Steele, Ollie Schniederjans, Martin Kaymer, Charles Howell III, Martin Laird and Brandon Harkins. Tournaments – It feels like a week where Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could easily go under-owned due to poor recent form or poor course history.
1716	1716	10	10	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some early observations from the @DraftKings prices for the WGC-Mexico: DJ and Thomas are far and away the top two,… https://t.co/3vuhD74OJh
11456	11456	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly. Remember, could.
8636	8636	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As you can see, there is one category absent from that list, putting. Haas ranked a dissapointing 67th out of a total 69 players in SG: Putting, which put to sword any chances of him contending. The positive news is that last time out at the Dell Tech Championship, Haas ranked 10th in SG: Putting, as well as inside the top-15 for SG: Tee-to-Green, Approach and Around-the-Green.
4789	4789	23	23	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Las Colinas is a par 70 which means two extra par 4s. It makes sense, therefore, to look at Par 4 Performance and Finau is T5 in that list (DJ T8th by the way) which has to bode well. He was ranked 11th on the Pars at this venue last year.
9706	9706	1	1	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th. This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances.
3106	3106	45	45	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had been a sneaky play the last couple of weeks because his price was so low and came up empty handed both times. His price tag of $9,100 can still be viewed as a value in this field and with winning upside all know Kirk has. He will likely go overlooked this week due to some very popular names priced right below him.
9139	9139	40	41	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
788	788	25	25	target: Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 10th in SG tee to green, 30th in SGP, 15th SG off the tee. With a solid record here and decent current form Piercy could be worth a look here. Grayson Murray 55/1  This guy looks an incredible future prospect and comes to Vegas in superb form.
1729	1729	85	86	target: Jordan Spieth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter.
8121	8121	35	35	target: Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At Quail Hollow he’ll have a big distance advantage but he hasn’t pulled together all aspects of his game since March. Perhaps he’ll find it this week as a somewhat shadowed favorite behind McIlroy and Spieth. Hideki Matsuyama, $8800 – A Sunday 61 to win by five in a world-class field was a telltale signal Matsuyama can beat almost anyone when he’s on.
12416	12416	4	4	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Jeff Bergerson  Tony Finau  Finau rates out almost perfectly for this course and should be a match-play stud given his aggressiveness, but as always his putter is the main issue. He's the longest golfer on the tour (ranked in driving distance, he's eighth in all drives) and ranks 39th in strokes gained off the tee, thanks to his atrocious accuracy -- Finau hits the fairway only 52.39 percent of the time. His short iron play would seem to need work as he's only minus-6 on approach shots between 50 and 125 yards, but for a long hitter he's actually been hitting woods and irons off the tee a bit more; Finau's taken only 51 shots between 50 and 125 yards.
13141	13141	86	87	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Waste Management Phoenix Open / Maybank Championship and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Emiliano Grillo / Steve Stricker; 3) Vaughn Taylor; 4) Ryan Blaum; 5) Ryan Moore; 6) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Jim Furyk; 8) Brian Harman / Martin Laird; 10) Adam Hadwin; 11) Chad Campbell; 12) David Hearn / Kevin Streelman; 14) Francesco Molinari; 15) Michael Thompson; 16) Kevin Kisner; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Fabian Gomez; 19) Russell Knox; 20) Tyrrell Hatton.

9587	9587	1	1	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us. Any further examination of his resume is unnecessary at this point, maybe even insulting.
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
10190	10190	15	15	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Length is I think a big part of playing out here. As for current form, Finau has been in fine fettle since the second half of last season. After a top five in Canada, his final six starts of 2017 read: 7-7-2-26-11-16.
11027	11027	13	13	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And getting climatized to thelast week only will work in his favor. Alex Noren  While the irons finally cooled off from their elite levels at Riviera, Noren still managed to pick up a stroke on the field, leaving sixth in Strokes Gained: Approach over the past 12 rounds. Now he’ll tackle a layout that should suit his eye far better, especially if the conditions get wet and windy.
10289	10289	28	29	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Both Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson are skipping this event, but there are a lot of elite players in attendance. Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler and last year’s champ Jon Rahm will all be in attendance, as will foreign stars like Justin Rose and Alex Noren. There is also a guy named Tiger Woods who will be in attendance, and you can check in on my thoughts on what to expect from Tiger here.
12736	12736	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Many will expect him to struggle overcoming the dissapointment of last year, but given his excellent mental strength, I have no doubts he can pick himself up and have a chance for the third time in four years. In an interview with The Telegraph, Rose was quoted saying “It definitely makes me more likely to win, not less likely,” Rose said. “Look at how the runners-up have done in recent years.
9135	9135	46	46	target: Simpson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Importantly he had also shown the ability to be able to play at altitude with 4th in Mexico and 2nd at Highland Springs CC in Missouri across 2015. 2014 winner Ben Martin had already finished 6th at Montreux in 2011 and other more straight-forward winners like Simpson, Na, Moore and Byrd all had top 8 finishes at TPC Scottsdale prior to winning this. Bookmaker Offers : Latest offers and extended each-way places are detailed below.
6246	6246	23	23	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, in a weak field like this, you are forced to roster golfers in cash that you wouldn’t necessarily do in stronger fields. Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring.
10773	10773	17	18	target: Nick Watney. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not liking a four-time winner of the event while he’s in form would be odd, no? Sleeper: Nick Watney. He boasts a strong record here (three top 10s) and it seems he’s rounding into form.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
2571	2571	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide. He had back-to-back T3 finishes at Crans-sur Sierre in 2014 and 2015.
7737	7737	61	62	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend, Harry Diamond, will take over the reins for now so all we can do is wait and see but in the short term at least, from a punting perspective, yet another disruption has to be viewed as a negative. Selections  I was more than happy to take a small chance on Spieth and I'm also playing course debutant, Tommy Fleetwood, whose game has improved inexorably this year. Fleetwood finished 27th at the Open Championship two weeks ago and that was a disappointing effort given the form he's been in and that Birdkdale's his local links but I think that second fact was the big problem.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
10544	10544	25	25	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident. As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh.
12274	12274	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is not in bad form at all, so 14/1 is plenty fair enough and I am happy to make him pick of the week here. Day has drawn Louis Oosthuizen, Jason Dufner and James Hahn in his group, and whilst this certainly could have been an easier draw, it doesn’t change my mind about his winning chances. He’s already proven he can beat Oosthuizen whilst Dufner and Hahn are unpredictable players, who of course can get hot, but in this format, I’ll take Day every time.
4760	4760	22	23	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. The aforementioned DJ is the model’s top golfer, but Matt Kuchar is this week’s Levitanimal. While his Saturday meltdown and 39.0-point DraftKings MDF performance at THE PLAYERS are off-putting, the numbers don’t lie.
8821	8821	6	6	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest. So much is about momentum at this time of year and while plenty of the field are going the wrong way, the Englishman is coming on strong.
3192	3192	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			7th here in 2014, wind and a soft course are the kind of conditions where Ryan truly comes to the fore. RESULT: MC  Bud Cauley 0.5pt EW 200/1 with Get a £20 free bet plus 6 places each way, 1/4 odds - get it here:  Bud Cauley has always been an aggressive sort whose tee-to-green game can be very effective. He performs better at low-scoring tests and his record here reads 8th in 2012 (on debut) and 16th in 2013.
10435	10435	1	1	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season. Rickie Fowler, $11900 – The flashy Fowler has lived up to his hype at the electric TPC Scottsdale, finishing fourth and second the last two years.
11204	11204	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has done well at PGA National, with top-15s in three of the past four years. Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago.
2528	2528	47	47	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East. Fleetwood beat a field including Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson to land the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and while that event does tend to see the favourites come up short on what’s typically their first start in months, this year’s winner is good enough to use victory as a springboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time.
7323	7323	35	35	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
1425	1425	30	30	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think he’ll be low owned and could pay off big time. Here is a LU I entered into the PGA $200K Birdie on Draft Kings:  Walker $9,900  Snedeker $9,700  Dufner $7,700  Kisner $7,400  McGirt $7,900  Tanihara $6,400    Leaving $1,000 on the table to play with. Best of luck!
4021	4021	50	50	target: Koepka’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Koepka came to life at the WGC-Dell Match Play, where he told reporters he’d figured things out en route to a share of ninth, before improving his score each day for 11th place in the Masters. Augusta National is no place to discover a game so it strikes me that Koepka’s claim that everything clicked at Bay Hill is accurate, and he can soon put the first three months of the season behind him and lift what would be his second PGA Tour title. A missed cut here last year would be a slight concern but he was just a single shot off the mark and had shown promise on his sole previous visit, so I’m more than happy to give him the benefit of the doubt and back up my suspicion that the course plays to his strengths.
5720	5720	18	19	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency. His good run of form began back in January where he finished T4 at the windy Waialae Country Club, home of the Sony Open.
3720	3720	22	22	target: Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First and foremost, Snedeker is very good when he does get a sniff. Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun.
2459	2459	34	34	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two. Click To Enlarge!
6148	6148	38	39	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall though, scoring conditions will likely be ideal throughout, so expect regular low scores here and possibly something in the high teens to win. Last six winners  2016 –- Russell Knox -14 (over Jerry Kelly -13)  2015 — Bubba Watson -16 (over Paul Casey in playoff)  2014 — Kevin Streelman -15 (over Sergio Garcia and KJ Choi -14)  2013 — Ken Duke -12 (over Chris Stroud in playoff)  2012 — Marc Leishman -14 (over Charley Hoffman and Bubba Watson -13)  2011 — Fredrik Jacobson -20 (over Ryan Moore and John Rollins -19)  Winning Trends  Four of the last seven winners of the Travelers have been first-time winners on the PGA Tour. Three of the last four winners of this event were coming into the week off of missed cuts in their previous start.
2029	2029	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
10976	10976	23	23	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
7613	7613	35	36	target: Patrick Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The results of events following a major tend to be fairly wide open because of the weaker base of players playing in these events. The first potential value that stands out on this chart is Patrick Rodgers who has roughly 60:1 odds to win this week despite a mere $7,000 price tag. The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat.
765	765	12	12	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can't wait for Webb Simpson Chalk mania this week.. On another note, Molinari is a guy I like heading into this complete unknown course
8923	8923	11	11	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While it’s often good to take a wait-and-see approach with golfers, Wise is someone I would not recommend waiting too long on as his pedigree suggests he won’t take long to adapt to his next level of competition. The course this week does seem to award aggressive play, which works in Wise’s favor as he is plenty long off the tee (averaged over 315 yards per drive) and ranked first in eagles made and 14th in birdies made last season on the Web.com Tour. At just $7,100, he makes for a solid tournament pick this week and is a golfer to track as we progress through the seven-week swing season.
541	541	6	6	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
6657	6657	29	30	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Throw in his wildness off the tee -- a shortcoming that's severely penalized at the Greenbrier -- and I'm staying away. Expert Picks  Kevin Kisner  Danny Lee  Keegan Bradley  Bill Haas  Patrick Reed  Sung Kang  Gary Woodland  Xander Schauffele  Webb Simpson  Russell Henley  Pinterest Icon Sportswire  Expert Explanation : Does Kisner even need rationale? Kisner has six top-10 finishes on the season, and was a runner-up the last time this event was played.
5044	5044	48	49	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Memorial Tournament is always a highlight of the PGA Tour as its Invitational status, combined with its positioning close to the second Major Championship, guarantees a high class field. 2018 doesn't disappoint with Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Henrik Stenson and 5 times Memorial winner Tiger Woods all in attendance. In all, 11 of the World's top-16 ranked players are in Dublin, Ohio this week.
462	462	7	7	target: Weekley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on D Lee, Cejka &amp; Weekley (long shot) in Puerto Rico this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
8370	8370	34	35	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Weekly Finalists:  My Favorites: You can see the entire list at mikeglasscott.com  Since none of the above are playing this week, time to get creative. My Choice: Webb Simpson  Close Second: Ryan Moore, Bill Haas  Outliers: Lucas Glover, Kyle Stanley, Haotong Li  Gut Shot(s): Kevin Na, Brandon Hagy  Rank Outsiders: Peter Malnati, William McGirt  QUESTION(S) OF THE WEEK:  Remember, if you don’t see a guy in my choices, it’s more than likely that I have already selected them. Who do I save???
5628	5628	42	42	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance. What makes Scott an elite golfer and always in contention is his game on the way to the greens, as he’s a longer hitter off the tee with an average drive of 302, and hits good drives 84.4% of the time.
181	181	1	2	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			7. Jordan Spieth - Spieth's just kind of been hanging around for the last couple of months, not doing anything particularly impressive. He should be charged for this run, however.
12199	12199	52	52	target: Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler isn't the only player in this field who would dearly love to win for Arnie, but his relationship with The King was particularly strong and, at a course where he won a junior title in 2006, he looks by some distance the strongest option at the front of the market. Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
12048	12048	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut. The following week Hatton’s ownership was much lower and we saw him finish T3 against a loaded field.
446	446	30	31	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This section is going to detail a few of the players who have the best fantasy value comparative to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Brandt Snedeker 51-1 $7,700 Gary Woodland $7400 and 67-1  Sean O’Hair $7800 and 80-1  Paul Casey $7900 and 80-1 Steve Stricker 90-1 $7,000 Jamie Lovemark$7200 and 125-1  John Senden $7200 and 150-1  Si Woo Kim $7300 and 110-1  HORSES FOR COURSES  Phil Mickelson loves being aggressive and this course has suited him well in the past. Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and has a 10th and 4th in his past 5 visits.
6873	6873	39	40	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In-Play Tactics    Moore sat third after round one and he was never headed form halfway but don't worry if your fancy has a poor first round as a slow start can be overcome at Deere Run. Steve Stricker and Zach Johnson have both won recently having trailed by seven strokes after round one and Spieth trailed by six after the opening day in 2013 and by eight two years later! Spieth was still five back at halfway in 2015 and he trailed by six shots after round three in 2013.
2153	2153	40	40	target: Dustin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera hasn’t been a place where players suddenly “find their games” and as the sort main event of the West Coast swing, emphasizing players who have performed well at the previous few events is not a bad idea. Stud Picks  Dustin Johnson ($11,400): Hard to argue with Dustin at all this week. Some point to Pebble Beach as his favorite course but this venue might actually suit him better.
53	53	1	2	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Webb Simpson -- Simpson is the ultimate horse for this course. He is a past winner and loves playing in his home state.
2385	2385	35	36	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fresh off a week in which he finished T-17 on a course that didn't exactly suit his game, Donald should be licking his chops to get back to the friendly confines of Florida. Bob Harig: Adam Scott ($12,200)  The defending Honda Classic champion has not finished worse than a tie for 14th in 10 of his past 11 starts worldwide. But he hasn't won during that stretch, either, lurking along ranked seventh in the world.
1324	1324	31	32	target: Fabian Gomez, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What you do off the tee is largely irrelevant at Waialae. Only two players in the top-12 ranked inside the top-ten for Driving Distance last year and the first thee home, Fabian Gomez, Brandt Snedeker and Zac Blair, ranked 27th, 21st and 58th for DD. Despite it being quite tight off the tee, Driving Accuracy hasn't been a key stat in recent years either though.
559	559	3	3	target: Henley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory, Rahm and Henley for me this week. Will look at the specials later in the week and likely add to these. #Masters #AugustaNational
3492	3492	2	2	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th). His putting will need to improve this week, but Augusta greens are a different challenge than anything the South African has faced this season and he knows exactly what to expect of them, after eight starts here.
9348	9348	10	10	target: Wesley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bryson is a great lower salaried play for salary relief. Wesley Bryan (Draftkings – $6,200, Fanduel – $7,300)  Wesley is a free square here. On Draftkings, he comes in at the third lowest salaried player and that is just a mistake.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
1200	1200	26	27	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Russell Knox; 3) Brendan Steele; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Pat Perez; 6) Branden Grace / Bubba Watson; 8) Justin Thomas / Jhonattan Vegas; 10) Daniel Berger; 11) William McGirt; 12) Ryan Moore. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Pat Perez; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Ryan Moore; 5) Russell Knox; 6) Patrick Reed; 7) Dustin Johnson; 8) Daniel Berger; 9) Brandt Snedeker; 10) Cody Gribble; 11) Si Woo Kim; 16) Branden Grace. Winners & Prices : 2016: Spieth 5/1 ; 2015: Reed 22/1 ; 2014: Zach Johnson 14/1 ; 2013: Dustin Johnson 14/1 ; 2012: Stricker 17/2 ; 2011: Byrd 50/1 ; 2010: Ogilvy 9/1 ; Average: 18/1.
2287	2287	9	10	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Justin Rose – $8,400  Hear me out for a second. No, Justin Rose didn’t necessarily burn you last week, but you could say he underwhelmed.
9674	9674	22	22	target: Henley's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was 17th last week in a 34-man field, but that does mean that he played in Hawaii a week ago. In Henley's three top-17s, he gained strokes on the field tee-to-green. In his poor performances, he lost strokes tee to green.
10880	10880	37	39	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He could be interesting at 125s. Shock Pebble Beach star Ted Potter Jr (125s) could ride the wave while Koreans KJ Choi (T26 at Pebble and brilliant record here including T5 in 2016) and Players Championship winner Si Woo Kim (68 in R2 last year despite MC) could also feature. Back up the price grid and Brendan Steele at 50s is a decent price in his home State and on greens he grew up on and I really like Alex Noren on this course which is perfect for his left-to-right ball flight but we've really ducked him at 35s.
9747	9747	1	1	target: Kirk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk, $8,700 – Kirk posted a convincing fourth place at the RSM Classic in his last PGA Tour start, where he shot rounds of 63 and 64 in the first and third rounds. Though his consistency has been a bit sporadic, Kirk should feel comfortable on a track where he’s two top-5s and 5-of-7 cuts since 2011. Strategy Tips for this week (based on 60k standard salary cap)    With FanDuel’s new six-player lineups this year (instead of eight), it’s more important than ever to make careful selections to ensure at least five of your guys make the cut.
1169	1169	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s supposed to be taking some time off for back issues — but he couldn’t resist the guaranteed large paycheck by playing in his own backyard — so approach with caution. Bubba Watson ($7,600): The defending champion is third in the field with a 312.8-yard LT DD, and he ranks seventh with a 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. His 6.7 percent Odds to Win are the best among this middle third of golfers.
1633	1633	4	4	target: Aphibarnrat 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lets go with 5/1 Aphibarnrat as well. #top20
5622	5622	12	12	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play.
1692	1692	3	3	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
1619	1619	25	25	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He could also only manage a T50 finish in his season opener, the Safeway Open. So why do I like the winless and seemingly inconsistent, Cauley this week? Well firstly the T3 finish last week is a huge factor.
5232	5232	1	1	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Perez – $6,800  Now this is a perfect price for Pat Perez. The last couple of events he saw Perez’s price tag creep a little high for my liking, even though he was still playing well and the course fit his game. Now we can roster Perez without the expectation of a T15 and be pleasantly surprised when it happens.
1990	1990	31	32	target: Jordan Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two top ten finishes then he missed the cut at Farmers Insurance Open and here he is where he was 41st last year, 4th in 2015 and 2nd in 2014. B:  Jordan Spieth. 16th in FedEx Cup ranking right now, 4 consecutive top ten finishes, his last three years at AT&T Pebble Beach - 21st, 7th and 4th.
5680	5680	30	30	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a terrific short game and he might just finish in front of Rory. If forced to pick one, I'd go for Lowry but I'd rather just take on McIlroy at [1.5] or shorter one the market materialises for modest stakes. Recommended Wagers  Russell Knox @ 11/8 (Sportsbook)  Lay Rory McIlroy Top Irish @ [1.5] or shorter    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
12456	12456	30	30	target: Lashley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, when we realize he is top 50 on TOUR in bogey avoidance, we can assume a correction is in order. This week is the perfect week to start as Lashley won on this course just last year (Web.com Tour event). Sticking to his profile of a bogey avoider, he swallowed just TWO bogeys the entire week during that victory.
6583	6583	10	10	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it. James Hahn – $8,800  In a week where Tony Finau looks to be the chalk, James Hahn will garner next to no ownership in a spot he could easily go off in.
170	170	23	23	target: Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song. And my man wants to sing.
1320	1320	11	11	target: Perez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The reason I struggle to pick him is the price. Pat Perez has won twice on the PGA Tour in 380 starts. This isn’t an impressive ratio, and given it was seven years between his two victories, Perez seems difficult to rely on.
5637	5637	14	15	target: Brooks Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Wood, Bernd Wiesberger  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jason Day, Brooks Koepka, Alex Noren, Marc Leishman, Branden Grace, Adam Scott, Branden Steele, Jordan Spieth  – Thomas Pieters, Louis Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Sean O’Hair, Chris Wood, Patrick Reed, George Coetzee, Bernd Wiesberger  Bets:  Jason Day 12-1  Alex Noren 55-1 ew  Louis Oosthuizen 67-1  Marc Leishman 125-1/100-1 ew  George Coetzee 250-1 ew Two top fives in his last three starts means O’Hair shouldn’t be forgotten about this week. His best finish last season was also on a US Open venue at Beth Page Black when he finished T2 at the Barclays.
3310	3310	28	29	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has top 20 upside this here this week and is a really nice value at only $7,300, that can be used in both cash games and GPPs. Jason Dufner: (7,100) Dufner is another player who is just way too cheap for how consistent he has been this season. The 70th ranked player in the world has been great, only missing one cut this season, and finishing no worse than T25 in all of the events he has made the cut.
4126	4126	9	9	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
780	780	17	17	target: Johnston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
512	512	8	8	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FanDuel is giving us a nice discount on Spieth this week by including DJ in their field for the @ShellHouOpen who WD earlier today.
13382	13382	3	3	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said, Murray is one of the best in the field this week with his mid-to-long irons and should be able to find the green in scoring position relatively easily. Although his putting numbers also don’t reflect well (154th), Murray still averages only 1.74 putts per hole which is T31, and his one-putt percentage of 40.7% is T50th. The reasons to like him this week are for his incredible rates.
8907	8907	49	50	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've read about this year's wave rather than seen much of them in action but, for this week, two who make plenty of birdies are Keith Mitchell and Denny McCarthy. However, it's another player still fresh off some excellent play in the Web.com finals who gets my third pick....        Chesson Hadley is no 21-year-old young buck ready to take the world by storm. He's a 30-year-old who knows that plenty of talent and early promise isn't a golden ticket to years and years of automatic success.
7837	7837	28	28	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS. Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign.
7522	7522	13	13	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has played here twice and although the results haven’t been spectacular but Finau has still made both cuts. Finau is also second in the field in par 5 birdie or better %, which will be crucial to success for the week. With a solid mix of good recent form and a setup for this course, I will be all over Finau in all formats this week.
828	828	62	62	target: Knost 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My third pick is a player that I tipped for this last year but the logic still applies and while he is in fairly poor form I think he is perfectly suited to this course so I’ wiling to give him another go at a big each way price. With huge greens this week then 3-putt avoidance will be crucial and Colt Knost ranked 23rd in 2016 for this while also ranking 1st for driving accuracy. Knost is a former US Amateur Champion and World No.
12860	12860	1	1	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that. The Brit has a lethal combination of recent form and course form, and he brings an exceptionally good value.
1409	1409	6	6	target: Cabrera-Bello. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I see @DraftKings brought back Chalka Cabrera-Bello.
407	407	0	1	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley 145/1 - 16th in Strokes Gained: Approach this year. Made the 10th most birdies in the field at the Honda.
947	947	15	15	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First look at the #RSMClassic board, few long shots sticking out. Cook 80-1 Tway 100-1 Power 125-1 Wise 125-1 Ha… https://t.co/9aSkYXRGx2
8716	8716	45	45	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Leishman got himself in a great position to win the tournament before a poor tee-shot at 10 set him off on the wrong path coming home but it's hard to be too down about a top three. "Game is in a good spot, playing well," Leishman said later. "Putter feels good.
1215	1215	28	28	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The elevation changes, having to judge the elevation change with the wind, the ball just kind of does some crazy stuff out here." It's not for everyone but Spieth loves to get creative and work out a puzzle and the 2016 winner may be very hard to stop. Patrick Reed can certainly beat the best of them.
6696	6696	18	18	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He may lose his touch at some point again, but for now, ride the lightning. MID TIER  Bud Cauley ($8,500) – He didn’t look great at the QLN, but that was a far more brutal track than ol’ Deere Run, and Cauley should be able to make short work of this track with his usual T2G excellence. Buy early and often!
712	712	163	164	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour / Ted Potter Jnr; 3) Tyler Duncan; 4) Ben Crane; 5) Webb Simpson; 6) Ryan Moore; 7) Ken Duke; 8) Zach Johnson; 9) Corey Conners; 10) Emiliano Grillo / David Hearn; 12) Rob Oppenheim; 13) Chez Reavie; 14) Vaughn Taylor; 15) Kevin Na / Conrad Shindler; 17) Jon Curran; 18) Keegan Bradley / Martin Laird; 20) Lucas Glover / Richy Werenski. Greens in Regulation : 1) Martin Flores; 2) Brendan Steele; 3) Brice Garnett; 4) Harold Varner III; 5) Corey Conners; 6) Luke List; 7) Keith Mitchell; 8) Graham DeLaet / Sam Saunders; 10) Zach Johnson; 11) Lucas Glover; 12) Tyler Duncan; 13) Bud Cauley; 14) Emiliano Grillo / Rory Sabbatini; 16) Ryan Armour / Keegan Bradley / Matt Every / J.J. Spaun; 20) Zac Blair / Stephan Jaeger / Jason Kokrak / Ryan Moore / Rob Oppenheim. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Robert Garrigus; 2) Kevin Na; 3) Jason Gore / Andrew Landry; 5) Webb Simpson; 6) John Daly; 7) Brice Garnett; 8) Danny McCarthy / Peter Uihlein; 10) Roberto Diaz / Rory Sabbatini / Ricky Werenski; 13) Matt Every / Peter Malnati / Grayson Murray; 16) Rob Oppenheim; 17) Bronson Burgoon / Martin Laird / Martin Piller; 20) Nate Lashley.
814	814	4	4	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Par 4 Scoring – Koepka, Castro, Cauley, McGirt, Simpson  3. Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5.
3817	3817	1	1	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas – $9,100  Boring Bill Haas is flying under the radar once again. Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green.
229	229	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes 40-1... has smoked Pebble a couple times, good on poa, always seems to take a few starts to round into best form
7675	7675	32	32	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Dustin Johnson ($11,800) – Wow, Jordan Spieth is the highest priced. I guess I get it, but for this course, give me DJ all day.
12540	12540	5	5	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			in 2013 and 2011 respectively. Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price.
1815	1815	5	5	target: Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
4460	4460	11	11	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form here makes pretty grim reading, despite making 3/3 cuts. Grace has not managed to finish better than T42, as he seemingly struggles to put four rounds together here. In 2013 he posted a final round 77, to fall 30 places, after getting inside the top-10 earlier in the round.
12785	12785	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet.
11530	11530	79	80	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”  Last Week Rank: 16,851  Season Rank: 4872 *Did not play most of Segment 1*  Starters:  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Branden Grace  Marc Leishman  Bench:  Justin Thomas  Paul Casey        Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Mo Yoshimoto    “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Rank: 2063  Season Rank: 384  Starters:  Jordan Spieth  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Bubba Watson  Bench:  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay    ~    One-and-Done      Each week I will think out loud about my process in determining my One-and-Done selection.

3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
651	651	18	18	target: CANTLAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			HUH 200/1: 9th Valspar, 3rd here, good $ CAMPOS 310/1: riding wave PETERSON 150/1: continue to like him CANTLAY 60/1: game fits, motivated
2645	2645	24	24	target: Haas: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be able to handle the altitude at Chapultepec and I am expecting a top 30 finish out of him this week. Bill Haas: (7,000) If you want to take the course manager approach this week with this being a course we are very unfamiliar with, Haas makes a lot of sense at his cheap price. He has yet to miss a cut this season and has finished no worse than 20th place with a T4 at the other WGC event this year, The HSBC Champions.
6538	6538	26	27	target: Vaughn Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putting -- which is usually his downfall -- can come around, DeChambeau will return to the form we have been expecting. -- Jeff Bergerson  Vaughn Taylor  Solid in approach play from short distances, Taylor is usually short but accurate off the tee and has excellent proximity numbers. He has above-average putting numbers across the board, performs better on par-3s and -4s (he struggles on par-5s due to the distance), but has also never made the cut here and will be a high-risk/high-reward play thanks to expected low ownership.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
8161	8161	30	30	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can see a top 10 or top five for him, which I really can’t see for many guys under $7,000. Webb Simpson (DK: $6,800, FD: $6,000)    Beyond McIlroy and Fowler, there isn’t another player in the field who has racked up the consistent results at Quail Hollow than Simpson. He is a member at the course and a Charlotte native who seems to love the hometown vibes.
4117	4117	43	44	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2032	2032	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
4997	4997	16	16	target: Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the season, he's T20 in proximity, T45 in ball striking and 63rd in GIR. Blayne Barber - $6,900    Barber has not missed cut in a stroke-play event since February and is coming off a T16 at TPC Sawgrass (albeit a course he was very familiar with). Barber was T34 in his Colonial debut last year.
2134	2134	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Steve Stricker: Round 1: 6th, Round 2 2nd, Round 3: 1st. Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Dustin Johnson: 3rd Pebble/ MC Torrey/2nd Abu/6th Kapalua. Bubba Watson: MC Pebble Beach/14th TPC Scottsdale/10th Kapalua/1st World Challenge.

6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
769	769	3	3	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zurich runner up Kisner value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt better than ave (line) on handy GP ch… https://t.co/rwvtGxVwYn
581	581	0	1	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth (10,600)  One of the odd things about this event is that we see top players at the lowest salaries we may have seen them at all year. Spieth is cheaper than we have seen him all year, and has the form and history I like to see this week. Spieth has made the cut in all 3 Playoff events, with 2 top 10s during the Playoffs.
803	803	8	8	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rob Bolton of PGATour.com did not even include Koepka in his top 15 ranked players for the week. Josh Culp at Future of Fantasy, one of my favorite golf follows, has Koepka ranked 8th based on the analysis that “unfortunately, he’s bookended a couple of missed cuts here with a T4 (2015), so it’s been very boom-or-bust. Avoid him in cash due to that course history and potential jetlag, but he’s a great GPP option with loads of birdie/eagle potential.” I believe this thinking lends to Koepka having a solid ownership floor as people will want a bit of exposure, but also the possibility that he could go very under-owned in many of the more expensive, smaller entry limit tournaments with competitors focusing on other highly priced players like Moore, Rahm and Na.
3843	3843	2	2	target: Kaymer: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Martin Kaymer: Kaymer has not missed a cut in his last 28 starts worldwide. He’s coming off his best Masters finish (by far) as he finished T16 last week on the back of a final round 68.
3766	3766	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
11012	11012	12	12	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – Genesis Open  Lock of the week:  Paul Casey – $10,200 – The upper range on DraftKings presents some great options in this stellar field for the Genesis Open. We love the way Casey fits into GPP and cash lineups allowing you to avoid the fairly weak $6K range. He finished T8 last week at Pebble while leading the field in SG:T2G.
6396	6396	4	5	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Danny Lee, Webb Simpson, Jimmy Walker & Harris English – Lee’s the defending champ and comes in playing his best golf since that win two years ago. He’s made six cuts in a row with three Top 10s in that stretch… Sandwiched in between MC’s at the Greenbrier Classic, Webb has three Top 10s in his six career appearances at the Old White… Walker has an excellent history at the venue, he simply needs to get his whole game on one page. In a field of scrubs, it’s difficult to pass on his elite upside… English has a sneaky chance to win this week.
1347	1347	26	26	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s. Justin Rose ($9,300)  You can pair him with Casey or pivot from Casey to Rose. Either way works as both are priced low enough.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
8319	8319	25	25	target: Reavie’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie’s success has been coming from his Approach game, where he has been gaining just under a stroke a round once field adjusted. I like Reavie’s affordable price tag and see the ownership low enough to be playable in GPP’s well the floor is high enough he makes a great cash game play. Chad Campbell – Cash – DK: $7900 FD: $6800  Golfs next big thing Chad Campbell is starting to look like what was promised so many years ago.
1189	1189	7	7	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @ahadwingolf at 55/1 in the @cbgolfchallenge. Hadwin has finished second and sixth in the last 2 years at th… https://t.co/hojIe8sYZG
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
6400	6400	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully the easy-to-hit fairways afford him the ability to put the remainder of his game to good use. Tony Finau & Sean O’Hair – Finau’s made nine of ten cuts, crushes Par 4s, and now gets to deal with fairways you can land an aircraft carrier on. After missing out on my boy Stanley last week, I refuse to the let same happen with Finau… O’Hair does everything pretty well across the board, then laps everyone on the Par 4s.
1676	1676	9	9	target: Woodland, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For a player who hits it as long as Woodland, his ranking of 59th in scrambling is very underrated. Woodland ranked 30th in SG:App last season and 23rd in GIR. He is coming off of a sixth-place finish in the Sony Open two weeks ago and will look to keep up his great playing this week.
11805	11805	27	27	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Picks to win  Ryan Moore  I was tempted to pick Tiger Woods here, but -- spoiler alert -- I'll save that one for next week. Instead, the pick is Moore, who arrives at the intersection of form and familiarity.
5435	5435	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is too much risk and barely any upside with Gay this week. Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt.
7174	7174	23	23	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Sergio sees a lot of ownership because of this but I will still be overweight on him for the week. Henrik Stenson – GPP – DK: $9600 FD: $8700  Stenson is quietly showing good form just in time to defend his Open Championship title. With a T10 and a T26 in his last two events, I am not worried about his earlier season struggles.
2926	2926	29	29	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the 2015 event but from 2011 to 2016 his finishing positions read 3-15-2-MC-9. While the front end of the market looks extremely strong, it's the 20/1 about Rose that appeals most. The course has undergone regular changes in recent times and Palmer's aim was for it to play like a US Open course from the tee but like a Masters on and around the greens.
10696	10696	22	23	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With great current form so far this season and I expect him to have a decent week especially with his record here. Chesson Hadley 45/1  I like the look of the in-form Chesson Hadley on a course he has expressed his liking for in the past. Hadley has been playing well over the last couple of months with four top 5’s and a top 25 in his last eight starts.
2881	2881	4	4	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A no brainer. Tyrrell Hatton ($9,100) – “Impressive” would be putting it lightly for Tyrrell Hatton this year in his transition to being a part-time PGA player. Hatton contended for the win at the very tough PGA National and made a nice run in Mexico two weeks ago – he has not finished worse than T13 worldwide in his last four starts.
11233	11233	20	20	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last four appearances this season he has made every cut and even posted a T5 at Waste Management. Hadley ranks highly in our FGI Model when you sort by statistics as he has been extremely good tee-to-green this season. At only $7,700 this week, I like his value for cash games, but also like his upside for GPPs.
3102	3102	20	20	target: Byrd 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He fits perfectly into that stars and scrubs lineup construction this week. Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Jonathan Byrd  World Golf Ranking (#525)  Vegas Odds (100/1)  Draftkings ($6,200)  FanDuel ($5,500)  After a rough start to 2017, Byrd is coming off a T5 on Web.com Tour and made two of three cuts in the wrap around portion fo the PGA Tour. Not only that, he comes back to Puerto Rico with some nice course history.
8063	8063	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the length of the course it is good to have a bigger hitter on board and Finau fits that bill, ranking 6th in Driving Distance on the PGA Tour. Anything in the three-figure mark about a player with Finau’s upside is worth a second look and I think he can go well here, especially if he finally gets the putter rolling. Even when finishing 5th in Canada last time out, Finau only ranked 55th in Strokes Gained: Putting, losing strokes on the field (-.405) and unfortunately this is definitely his Achilles Heel.
381	381	10	10	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valspar bets: Berger 35-1 Dufner 40-1 An 50-1 Simpson 60-1 Horschel 65-1 Watney 100-1 Ollie 110-1 Saunders 500-1
8996	8996	0	1	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $12300 FD: $10500  Despite the high price tag it is incredibly hard to go against Thomas this week. Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic.
6326	6326	5	5	target: Kaufman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value picks (below $7500):  Smylie Kaufman ($7000) – The LSU product has been having some success recently, with four top-35 finishes in his last six official events, and has better form off the tee than his overall ranking suggests. Kaufman still struggles to find the fairway with the driver, but should easily get there if he clubs down, and he’s above average from the 175-200 range which is a big plus this week. He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently.
179	179	9	9	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open 2017 Tips: Brandt Snedeker 28/1 3pts e/w Billy Horschel 50/1 1pt e/w Jason Dufner 66/1 1pt e/w RT's appreciated
261	261	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is definitely hard enough to punish even some of the very best, so I would still consider it to be a potentially palatable investment opportunity. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Jason Day ($12,500) and Dustin Johnson ($12,100) – I hate to sound like a broken record here, but these two simply cannot be bested in terms of their sheer combination of power, accuracy, and precision. While they both bear some risk at their salary levels, I think it would be outrageous to fade them with their current form and proven ability to take this course apart.
7732	7732	16	17	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Market Leaders  Matt Kuchar was absolutely exhausted in Canada last week and there's a possibility that Jordan Spieth is still fatigued after the pair's epic duel at Royal Birkdale a fortnight ago but that a big if. The world no.2 took last week off and a well-rested and refreshed Jordan Spieth is most definitely the man to beat and I'm a little surprised he's not a shade shorter than he is. As already highlighted, this is a tournament that favours the very best and two of the last three winners have won here after having a week's rest following a major victory.
6534	6534	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sky Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31. -- Michael Collins  DraftKings value picks  Nick Taylor  Taylor has been on a pretty hot run the past month or so, and we're going back to the well at this price.
6747	6747	31	31	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A player who enjoys cut in the fairways and receptive greens, the New Zealander will love the fact that 37mm of rain fell on Monday. 3rd in this week's Predictor Model, Lee is chasing a Presidents Cup spot on Nick Price's International team and with no Open Championship start despite finishing 5th at TPC Four Seasons, 6th at Colonial, 3rd at TPC River Highlands and 9th last week at Old White TPC since the start of May, the only way to keep the forward momentum going is to keep churning out results on short set-ups where he thrives. We know that Deere Run is a specialised test where players often churn out regular contending performances, so it's interesting to note the detail behind Danny's last visit here in 2015.
4635	4635	39	39	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have. It’s easy to eat his salary this week with the players below, so here’s how DJ fares in the crucial categories:  Bogey Avoidance – 3 rd  Birdie or Better % – 6 th  SG: Tee to Green – 1 st  Par-4 Scoring – 2nd  Johnson has also finished no worse than T12 in his last three years here, and has never missed a cut at TPC Four Seasons. Zac Blair ($6600): The second-best scrambler on Tour (and best in the field), Blair also sits in an elite group in the Bogey Avoidance category (9th).
2693	2693	9	9	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Among the many small reasons for expecting improvement from DeChambeau is his form here as an amateur, which includes guiding SMU to victory when he was the only player in a good field to break 70 in both rounds at the course. Isolated, that’s nowhere near enough to make a case but DeChambeau caught the eye last time, striking the ball exceptionally well at the extremely difficult PGA National only to find all his work undone by one of the worst putting displays you’ll see. What particularly impressed about his tee-to-green play was the fact that DeChambeau was nursing a nasty cut to his hand in practice, and on the assumption that he’s both recovered and able to bring that ball-striking to Copperhead, he might just have a chance.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
4981	4981	34	35	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
10084	10084	34	34	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had to miss the U.S Open (although for good reason, his daughter’s graduation), separated from his longtime caddie Jim “Bones” McKay, and was cut from the final two majors. Believe it or not, Mickelson has not won on Tour since his British Open victory in 2013. It doesn’t matter what event or how strong the field, Mickelson wants to win, now.
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
11798	11798	36	36	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith knows how to dial it back off the tee as well as avoid bogeys when missing the fairway, which is so important at a course such as Copperhead. In his 28 measured rounds this year, Smith has made bogey on only 11.5 percent of his holes (T-5). Smith is also 8-under on 43 attempts from outside 200 yards, 2-under from the rough (T-18) and great at both one-putting and scoring in general.
202	202	12	12	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Farmers - 2ew Woodland 40-1; 1ew English 90-1, Finau 66-1, Grillo 66-1; 0.5ew M Kim 200-1, Rodgers 175-1
11118	11118	10	10	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Opens, but I feel like this feels like it." Remember Thomas shot the lowest score in U.S. Open history last year when his -9/63 powered him into 2nd place after 54 holes at Erin Hills. He eventually finished 9th, proving how fast a learner he is by winning the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow with a technical-level winning score of -8/276.
9007	9007	6	7	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fact and figures  Course record: 61, Justin Thomas, round two in 2015-16 season. Most Birdies: 30, Justin Thomas, 2015-16. He made 29 last year.
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
6734	6734	46	48	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A result footprint which includes 7th at Copperhead, 9th at Quail Hollow, 5th at TPC Four Seasons, 6th at Colonial, 3rd at TPC River Highlands and 4th at Robert Trent Jones GC also links well to the likes of Stricker, Johnson, Spieth and Moore. Result: WD  Charles Howell III 1.5pts EW 40/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Charles Howell III is playing some great stuff right now and despite being a 'long time between drinks' as Ian Baker-Finch put it at the Quicken Loans National, the Augusta, Georgia man is well worth following this week.
3327	3327	26	27	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, putting has the most variance as a statistic so if the putter can get hot this weekend Casey will going low. Also Consider: Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose  Dark Horse  Tyrrell Hatton ($7600) – It can be intimidating to take a first timer at Augusta. However, we can make an exception.
303	303	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The winner: Rickie Fowler  If there is a player with the temperament to quickly recover from blowing a big PGA Tour win then it is Rickie Fowler. It looked like he was going to trade blows down the stretch with Patrick Reed until a huge wobble – bogey at 15, double at 16 and bogey at 18 – dropped him into a tie for 7th  Maybe I am a glass half full kind of guy but I saw lots to be positive about in Fowler’s play ahead of his defence of the Deutsche Bank at TPC Boston this week. This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.
5809	5809	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he may not quite face that this year with Erin Hills appearing more US PGA than US Open. Rickie Fowler 22/1 : Current form: 2-60-MC-11-3; US Open form: MC-MC-2-10-41  Seems to be judged to higher standards than most perhaps due to the profile he has built for himself. But ultimately he is a 2017 winner with a 2nd place finishjust two starts ago.
4705	4705	21	21	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He held the lead after three rounds during the 2016 Byron Nelson, but eventually fell to Garcia in a Sunday playoff. Koepka has placed top-20 in five consecutive events and ranks eighth on Tour in driving distance and 14th in strokes gained putting. GPP Weapon: A final-round 78 at THE PLAYERS will likely force some gamers to shy away from Garcia this week, but why not deploy the fifth-ranked golfer in the world who is playing some of the best golf of his career?
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship
4075	4075	8	9	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We love Finau in cash or GPP contests. Luke List $7,600 – List missed the cut last week at The Heritage at a course that was NOT suited for him, but was in tremendous form prior. He was owned around 15 percent in most DraftKings GPPs and may go a little under utilized this week.
13232	13232	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His record speaks for itself so he should contend. Matt Kuchar – Kuch hasn’t missed a cut here in his last 14 starts and, of course, won four years ago. Also played well reasonably well at Augusta.
4011	4011	1	2	target: Charley Hoffman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Charley Hoffman, I mean Valero Texas Open, brings us back to the great state of Texas where everything is bigger. Charley Hoffman’s wallet is especially bigger from playing in this event. We learned last week that when a guy dominates a course (cough, Luke Donald), that even if his statistics are horrible for the year that it is not wise to fade.

12008	12008	3	3	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
13375	13375	45	45	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Over on the Euro Tour, he’s missed two out of four cuts, but also picked up at T2 at the Hong Kong Open. Because he’s split time between the two tours, it’s important to note that his statistics will be based on small samples, but Suri is a great driver of the ball who’s got a solid approach game but may struggle to putt; growing up with Bermuda greens should see his putting improve from his poor results on the Euro Tour. From the Euro Tour, Suri ranks:  33 rd in SG: Off the Tee  in SG: Off the Tee 38 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green 39th in Driving Distance  He should be fairly low-owned as a name not many recognize but is definitely a high-risk/high-reward value play.
11638	11638	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Remember, could. A better case for Finau is his skill set and recent form. One of the PGA Tour’s premier bombers, Finau actually has been better with his irons and short game lately.
2315	2315	31	32	target: (Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a result, international players have reigned supreme at PGA National since the Honda Classic made it the host course in 2007. In 10 events, a non-American has won seven times (Adam Scott, Padraig Harrington, Rory McIlroy, Rory Sabbatini, Camilo Villegas, YE Yang & Ernie Els). And when Team Uncle Sam decides to vault into the winner’s circle, it’s not exactly the who’s who of the sport: Russell Henley (2014), Michael Thompson (2013) & Mark Wilson (2007).
7989	7989	77	78	target: Brooks Koepka; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Tommy Fleetwood; 2) Ross Fisher; 3) Henrik Stenson; 4) Xander Schauffele; 5) Paul Casey; 6) Gary Woodland; 7) Sergio Garcia / Jordan Spieth; 9) Hideki Matsuyama; 10) Steve Stricker / Bernd Wiesberger; 12) Adam Scott; 13) Jason Dufner; 14) Graham DeLaet / Lee Westwood; 16) Hudson Swafford; 17) Luke List; 18) Tony Finau / Rickie Fowler / Branden Grace.

1456	1456	2	2	target: Bryson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also bet Bryson at 70/1. Bounced back nicely last week. Think he starts contending in strong fields somewhat regularly here.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
1839	1839	31	32	target: J.J. Spaun: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has had very little success outside of the European Tour, but with a bigger PGA schedule, he’s definitely a talented guy to watch going forward when the price is right. J.J. Spaun: Spaun statistically massacred the field in virtually every phase of the game minus scrambling. Now with two successive top-ten finishes at reasonably tough tracks, he is a guy who absolutely needs to be on your radar going forward.
11010	11010	22	22	target: Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Leishman comes with all the safety of a top-tier play but carries a much more palatable price. Chez Reavie ($8,000)  Similar to Mickelson, Chez Reavie has been sizzling over the last two weeks. After a narrow loss in a playoff two weeks ago in Phoenix, Reavie followed that up with a T-2 in Pebble Beach.
1718	1718	5	5	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
1840	1840	31	31	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With these short and generous courses, just like with DJ, he should be sticking flip wedges and putting up the kind of scores you need to ship – as usual. J.J. Spaun ($7,900) – Spaun is easily one of the most exciting talents in the game right now. Outside of Hidekibot last week, nobody was statistically better all-around than Spaun on a reasonably tight and demanding track with super-firm greens.
9108	9108	29	30	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The GM Tipster is having another good season, check out how he has been doing at our golf betting tips homepage. WGC HSBC Champions Golf Betting Tips Advised Bets  Tyrrell Hatton 5 points each way at 20/1 with Sportnation.bet – When he is hot he is very hot, his last four starts he has finished 3rd, 8th, 1st and 1st. Was 23rd here last season in his second appearance in the event so has course knowledge.
625	625	31	32	target: Jordan Spieth: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Path to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Rory McIlroy: Round 1: 7th, Round 2: 5th, Round 3: 3rd. 2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 5th, Round 2: 2nd, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Billy Horschel: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 1st.
7398	7398	1	2	target: Kevin Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
10998	10998	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s 103.63 points per tournament in four trips to Riviera is the best among players with more than one start at this track. Jordan Spieth ($11,300) is tied with Johnson atop the field in LT Adj Bird Avg (16.4) and tied for second overall with his 68.0 LT Adj Rd Score. Players with comparable salaries and LT metrics have previously produced an average of 76.89 DraftKings points per tournament (PPT) with a +0.76 Plus/Minus and 54.3 percent Consistency Rating.
11801	11801	12	12	target: Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That means we need to take advantage of that type of thinking. Reavie is in play in all formats for me this week. -- Taras Pitra  Jason Dufner  Copperhead is a course that sets up nicely for an accurate player off the tee and approaching the green as well as somebody who can putt.
12801	12801	15	15	target: Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory. Naturally you can treble your odds with 888Sport's exclusive new customer offer as per the details at the top of the page if you prefer.
3047	3047	26	26	target: DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Names that stood out to me in this field were Mark Wilson, John Peterson, Bobby Wyatt, and Mark Hubbard. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Graham DeLaet ($10,600) – DeLaet MC last week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, but had strung together five strong weeks before last. It was a tough track and a tough field, so I’ll give DeLaet a pass.
2546	2546	6	6	target: Willett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Accepting that he could play poorly, Willett simply looks overpriced at 125/1 and on a course which really should suit, that’s enough for me. Rafa Cabrera-Bello is another frequent contender on the European Tour’s tighter courses and he's a factor here at 100/1, but again that’s a price which says his consistency should be considered a more valuable asset than Willett’s class and with four rounds for everyone, I’m not sure that’s the case. Instead, I like the look of Tommy Fleetwood at twice the price.
5111	5111	49	50	target: Shane Lowry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking a bit further down, Ryan Moore at 90s interests me given his love for fast greens (he has six top 20s at Memorial including a second and a fifth) while Steve Stricker (winner here in 2011) is still playing well enough (T7 Colonial) to run into a place. Shane Lowry bounced back to form at Wentworth and won the WGC-Bridgestone in Ohio while Sean O'Hair is a real form horse after 5-2 in the two Texas events (he has a fifth and two T12s here). Tony Finau deserves respect too after finishes of T11 and T8 in his two knocks here.
5684	5684	33	34	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This could be a perfect week for Scott to hoist another Major Championship trophy and his price is perfect to fit into your lineups. Others to Consider: Henrik Stenson ($9,300), Brendan Grace ($8,600), Justin Thomas ($8,300), Bernd Wiesberger ($7,100), Francesco Molinari ($7,000), Marc Leishman ($6,700)  Be sure to complete your PokerNews experience by checking out an overview of our mobile and tablet apps here.

12778	12778	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			283 yards (40th), 66.1% fairways (31st), 68.1% greens in regulation (19th), 69.6% scrambling (1st), 1.61 putts per GIR (8th). 2010, Phil Mickelson (-16). 297 yards (2nd), 60.7% fairways (45th), 75.0% greens in regulation (3rd), 77.8% scrambling (3rd), 1.76 putts per GIR (10th).

3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1046	1046	14	14	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SentryTOC Card 💰💰💰 Kiz 28-1 Harman 35-1 Bryson 66-1 Dufner 80-1 Si WOOOOOO 100-1 Cook 100-1 *EW on Bryson and below
11466	11466	28	28	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So did Justin Thomas, who tied for fifth with Thomas Pieters, who was the runner-up at Riviera two weeks prior. Only Ross Fisher, who tied for third with Rahm, entered in so-so form. To refresh: Mexico City is more than 7,500 feet above sea level, meaning the 7,300-yard track will play more like 6,500.
1561	1561	5	5	target: Bae 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Taken a chance on Sangmoon Bae at 169/1 and 13/2 for the top 20 in the #GenesisOpen. Bae loves Riviera and has fini… https://t.co/lpLOmpQz73
1010	1010	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk - $11,300  2. Charles Howell III - $9,200  3. Cody Gribble - $8,400  4.
11393	11393	45	46	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He wasn't in the field 12 months ago so course compatibility is unknown but given he's second in the FedEx Cup standings and looking for his third win in eight starts I was happy to overlook that given his price. Selections:  Jon Rahm @ [13.5]  Patton Kizzire @ [130.0]  I'll be back on Thursday or Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
3028	3028	25	25	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
3497	3497	23	23	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Knox, a businessman is a fine player, holding the course record (61) from the Members tees, at Augusta. Knox’ experience is invaluable and Thomas has again enlisted his help, ahead of his second Masters start. Jimmy Johnson, Thomas’ caddie also believes the now 4-time PGA Tour winner is in much better shape this time around.
4971	4971	19	19	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has finished no worse than 15th at Colonial in the past three years, winning the event in 2015. Kirk hasn’t missed a cut at this event in his last six starts, and his 68.6 Course Adj Rd Score ranks fourth among golfers with more than one start at this track. Kirk had struggled this season, but he finished 12th in his last time out at THE PLAYERS Championship.
9963	9963	31	31	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Beyond the ability to pile up birdies, players will need consistent ball striking and great putting under 10 feet to compete across the three courses. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jon Rahm, $12500 – Rahm enters as World No.3 and the highest ranked in the field after finishing runner-up two short weeks ago in the Sentry TOC. Prior to that he won the European Tour finale prior to the holidays, so this young gun is easily the cream of the crop this week in a semi-diluted field.
13148	13148	26	27	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically he's perfect for me this week and after shooting -5/67 on Sunday at Augusta to finish a career-best 20th, he's arriving with momentum. Result: T5  Ryan Moore 1pt EW 60/1 with Get a £/€20 risk-free bet** for new accounts, 18+, T&Cs apply (7 EW, 1/5 odds):  I will close with Ryan Moore who I think will be the kind of plotter who could thrive at Harbour Town. A player who's traditionally gone from Augusta direct to Quail Hollow in terms of schedule, Ryan now finds himself outside of the OWGR top 50 and needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid having to qualify for the U.S. Open.
7041	7041	8	9	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			lineup: Kevin Streelman, Steve Stricker, Charles Howell III, Brian Harman (Starters); Smylie Kaufman, Jamie Lovemark, Daniel Summerhays, Wesley Bryan (Bench). Knockout/One-and-done pick: Brian Harman. RELATED: The Golf Digest Tournament Predictor  WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS
8806	8806	19	19	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You'd fancy backing him anywhere at the moment but this tournament must rank amongst his favourites given recent visits. Rose didn't make it last year but in the previous four years finished 2-4-6-2. "I really enjoy this golf course.
12575	12575	35	35	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will always be a popular player in terms of ownership, and generally the highest priced golfer gets a little bump just because. I will much rather spend the $100 less for the lower owned Rose who likely has a greater win probability. Luke List – $9,600  Welcome to Luke List chalk week.
8819	8819	38	38	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back him win only at 9/2. In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up.
11073	11073	45	45	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the event in 2012 and should have done again in 2014, 12 months after he withdrew with 'toothache' but he's missed out on weekend employment in each of the last two editions and I'm more than happy to swerve him. It's not often Sergio Garcia catches my eye before the off but I can certainly see him going well this week. Sergio is a regular here and with form figures reading 43-13-50-8-31-2-14 he's trending in the right direction and he won't mind the wind one iota.
7700	7700	14	14	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Sleeper: Russell Henley.
8173	8173	77	78	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So a long Quail Hollow course will play even longer. Key Stats to Winning at Quail Hollow (in order of importance)    • Ball striking (total driving + greens in regulation)/strokes gained tee to green  • Putting average/strokes gained putting  • Scrambling/strokes gained around the green  • Par 4 efficiency scoring 450-500 yards    Past Wells Fargo Champions at Quail Hollow    2016 - James Hahn  2015 - Rory McIlroy  2014 - J.B.

5215	5215	0	0	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week. This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day.
1009	1009	1	3	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8. Charles Howell III - A strong player on Sea Island and off to a good start this season with a pair of top-15s. Never much of a threat to win, but good for points.
7124	7124	26	27	target: Francesco Molinari, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
9839	9839	72	76	target: Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Alfred Dunhill Links / Safeway Open and includes PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Kyle Stanley; 2) Ryan Armour / Russell Henley / Brian Stuard; 5) Brian Harman; 6) Chez Reavie; 7) Jordan Spieth; 8) Colt Knost / William McGirt; 10) Kevin Na; 11) Austin Cook; 12) Ben Martin; 13) Steve Wheatcroft; 14) Kevin Kisner; 15) Justin Thomas; 16) Tyler Duncan / J.J.

5269	5269	13	13	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Consider him a solid value although not a great bet to win. Patrick Cantlay $7,800 – Cantlay has been a little overpriced this season at times, but we love the value at this week’s event in addition to his excellent form. He hasn’t missed a cut and has thrown in two T10’s.
13247	13247	2	2	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head. Moreover, his lack of driving accuracy (140th) and iffy iron game (60th in strokes gained: approach) forecast trouble.

6408	6408	7	8	target: Johnson Wagner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Humpnostication  Another highly-rated player in Levitan’s model, Johnson Wagner, has made five straight cuts here and has a second-place finish on his resume from 2013. Further, Wagner is fresh off a T5 finish at another Par 70 TPC course last week, where he posted 78.0 DraftKings points. Wagner has posted 64.25 PPT and a +20.18 Plus/Minus in his last two trips to the Old White.
3197	3197	10	10	target: Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Full First Round Leader stats are here . 2016 - Hoffman - PM -8/64. 2015 - Piercy - AM -9/63.
7706	7706	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His play has been strong all year, and as his record proves, Firestone is a good track for him. Also like: Adam Scott, Branden Grace and Alex Noren. The Aussie is a past champ and has mostly been in good form this year.
3547	3547	60	60	target: Hadwin, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He isn’t the longest hitter ranking 133rd in driving distance at 287.2 yards, but his game is solid top to bottom, ranking 16th in strokes gained tee to green, 22nd in strokes gained approaching the green, 19th in GIR percentage (72.2%), 81st in strokes gained putting, 34th in par five scoring, and 50th in birdie or better percentage. Just like Hadwin, he also has been a player who has stayed out of trouble all year, ranking 2nd in bogey avoidance this season. He isn’t the sexiest play, but his chances of making the cut and finishing inside the top 25, make him one of the safest cheap plays on the board.
11769	11769	18	19	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since 2009, Kuchar has made seven appearances at this venue and never finished outside of the top 40. Jason Dufner – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10100  Dating back to 2009 Jason Dufner has never finished outside of the top thirty at this event. Add in the fact that Dufner has made 12 straight cuts at events with a cut and Dufner is a cash lock for me this week.

12383	12383	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.

747	747	33	34	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Superior iron players will be rewarded with the appropriate birdie putt volume needed to keep up with the ridiculous scoring pace required to contend here, regardless of their length. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Kevin Na ($9,500) – If you can believe it, this is actually an event Kevin Na won back in 2011 with a ridiculous score of -23, and it’s easy to see why. If length is taken out of the equation, Na has one of the best combinations of iron play and putting in the game.
7837	7837	28	29	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS. Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign.
330	330	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed — It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it’s hard to see why he doesn’t deserve a look again this week. He’s in America Mode.
5227	5227	29	29	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His missed cut will still be hurting those he burned, and his price tag this week won’t be drawing them back in. $8,700 is a lot to pay for Dufner at this event, but he will not have any ownership on him this week so rostering 5% of him will likely put you overweight on him. He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week.

1694	1694	24	24	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The talent is no doubt there, along with form (current and course) so at 40/1 he looks good value to do just that. Tony Finau 50/1 (Betfred) 1pt e/w:  Finau has been in great form of late, most notably his T4 finish last week at Torrey Pines. After a slow start to the season (T26, T33, T41, MC) Finau turned a corner at the Tournament of Champions finishing T9.
4556	4556	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better time than the PLAYERS. Rickie Fowler – $9,300  It is all or nothing for Rickie Fowler at TPC Sawgrass. Literally.
7239	7239	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Therefore, an ideal candidate would be an experienced American, who teed it up at Dundonald Links last week. There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
10872	10872	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Next Best: Back Paul Casey EW @ 28/1  I'll also go the front six of the betting for my next pick. I've been happy to trawl out the stat about Paul Casey not winning on the PGA Tour since 2009 and hence representing lack of value but, blimey, does he give each-way punters a run for their money every single week! It's been happening for an awful long time and starting with his top 10 at Pebble Beach last week and reading backwards the Englishman's results read: 8-8-11-19-7-5-33-4-5-13-5-11-5.
1120	1120	5	5	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Final #SonyOpen bet goes on @K_Kisner at 23/1. Kisner led the field last week in putting and should benefit from co… https://t.co/iUJm9loFse
1794	1794	17	18	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's why: In his last five appearances at Phoenix, he's gone T17, T2, T2, 15th and T5. Matt Kuchar ($7,400)  Kuchar is making his 2017 debut this week. We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week.
8449	8449	44	45	target: Charley Hoffman; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Gary Woodland; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Chad Campbell; 6) Rickie Fowler / Ben Martin; 8) Graham DeLaet; 9) Jason Dufner / Russell Henley; 11) Francesco Molinari; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Ollie Schniederjans; 14) Charley Hoffman; 15) Tony Finau; 16) J.J. Henry / Marc Leishman / Xander Schauffele / Steve Stricker; 20) Blayne Barber. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 4) Matt Kuchar; 5) Paul Casey / Xander Schauffele; 7) Rickie Fowler; 8) Justin Thomas; 9) Sung Kang / Grayson Murray; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Daniel Berger / Jordan Spieth; 14) Jonas Blixt / Robert Streb; 15) D.A. Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
2759	2759	10	10	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take my chances and buckle up for the ride. Billy Horschel ($7,900): Billy Ho the ol’ Florida Gator. He plays comfortably in Florida and comes off a nice T4 finish at the Honda Classic two weeks ago.
10123	10123	39	39	target: Chez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m always of the belief that putting can turn around almost immediately week to week, so targeting the top iron players at a course that doesn’t penalize lack of distance off the tee is a perfect spot for a Chez breakthrough. Reavie has 12th- and 17th-place ties in the last two years at the CareerBuilder, too. Webb Simpson  Happy learned how to putt.
198	198	9	9	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #careerbuilderchallenge Picks Reed 16-1 Casey 25-1 Rahm 28-1 Grillo 28-1 Lovemark 35-1 Piercy 50-1
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
7902	7902	14	14	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They just don’t need further explanation this week, and instead will be listed below. Rahm comes in at second in our Cheat Sheet, and while this will be his first trip to Firestone CC, the course design fits his gameplay extremely well, hence his #2 rank in the Cheat Sheet. As the #4 Par 4 Scorer on Tour, Rahm should be able to use his abilities to go low on this long Par 70 course.
10729	10729	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
10796	10796	36	37	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not a disaster result, but let's look for something better at Pebble Beach. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Jason Day (8-for-8 with five T11 or better)  Brandt Snedeker (7-for-10 with two wins)  Dustin Johnson (9-for-10 with two wins)  Jon Rahm (T5)  Patrick Reed (5-for-5 with three top 15s)  Kelly Kraft (3-for-3 including RUNNER-UP last year)  Gary Woodland 1-for-3 with T5 last year)  Phil Mickelson (18-for-21 with four wins)  Jimmy Walker (8-for-10 with WIN and T3)  Matt Jones (9-for-10 with five top 25s)  Luke Donald (6-for-8 with six top 30s)  J.B. Holmes (10-for-11 with six top 25s)  Nick Watney (10-for-13 with three top 10s)  Mac Hughes (T10)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Rory Mcilroy  Jason Day  Jon Rahm  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Austin Cook  Brandt Snedeker  Patrick Reed  Rafa Cabrera Bello    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker, Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, and Phil Mickelson.
13265	13265	2	2	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Webb Simpson  Webb has contended in this event (seven straight cuts made) for years, and that’s when he couldn’t putt. Still excellent with his irons, Simpson sits second in this field in Strokes Gained: Putting over his past 24 rounds. Overall, he’s posted two Top 10s in his last four stroke events and enters on the heels of a heater round Sunday at The Masters.
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
4112	4112	29	29	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts. Horschel loves the course and recently stated on Twitter that “It’s one of my favs of the year. Big fan of the course and the tournament staff that runs the event.
1733	1733	110	111	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter.
5219	5219	1	1	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years.
5606	5606	7	7	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler getting his first is another. Johnson defending this tournament might be the biggest of all, though. The real question is not, "can he?"
5989	5989	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed ($9,500): Reed may not have the razor sharp approach game that Casey has but he should be a good fit this week regardless as he can make up strokes at this venue with his improving short game and putter. Reed has a boom or bust history at this event with two top-twenties and two missed cuts over his last four appearances but I’m comfortable using him here as the real American hero has only finished outside of the top 25 once in his last six starts. Kyle Stanley ($8,400): I’m not sure if Stanley necessarily has what it takes to win at this venue, but like Casey his approach game can be so good at times that a shaky putter shouldn’t matter too much.
6396	6396	5	5	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Danny Lee, Webb Simpson, Jimmy Walker & Harris English – Lee’s the defending champ and comes in playing his best golf since that win two years ago. He’s made six cuts in a row with three Top 10s in that stretch… Sandwiched in between MC’s at the Greenbrier Classic, Webb has three Top 10s in his six career appearances at the Old White… Walker has an excellent history at the venue, he simply needs to get his whole game on one page. In a field of scrubs, it’s difficult to pass on his elite upside… English has a sneaky chance to win this week.
1149	1149	2	2	target: CHEZ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Probably another CHEZ week for me and some Knox. Can get on that DFS bandwagon of bashing your head into a wall a… https://t.co/6s08bOTlXz
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
12568	12568	9	10	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Jordan Spieth – $11,100  Spieth has disappointed in his last two events, missing the cut at the Valspar and not making it out of the group stage of the WGC Matchplay. People will be hesitant to play Spieth, despite being the third highest priced player, because of his poor recent form and with Augusta looming right around the corner.
3543	3543	21	21	target: Hadwin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,900) Hadwin has been one of my go to guys all season and I am not going to let his lack of course history pull me off him now. It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field.
154	154	11	11	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If I were playing #pga #dfs this week I would have Fowler in 100% my line ups. He is #1 in my @TFFDFS rankings. Matsu and Stenson high too.
7976	7976	17	18	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf: Top DraftKings Picks for the PGA Championship  August 05, 2017 Dustin Diez  Sharelines Rory McIlroy, Daniel Berger lead our top #DraftKings fantasy golf plays for the PGA Championship. #PGAChamp  The 2017 PGA Championship tees off at Quail Hollow Club on Thursday, setting up another exciting week of fantasy golf at DraftKings. In our final PGA preview of the season, we look at how to attack the course, as well as some of the top picks to target and some sleepers to target for your teams.
8982	8982	30	31	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Anytime a shorter course like this is played on the PGA Tour, finding fairways and hitting short-iron approaches close (50-125 yards) are essentials to scoring. It’s no surprise two-time champs Justin Thomas (2015 & 2016) and Ryan Moore (2013 & 2014) were dominant in these categories when they won here. As a starting point, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green is an excellent broad-scope ballstriking stat this week, followed by more specific indicators of driving accuracy and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green.
1847	1847	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here. We know low scoring is Reed’s forte, with three of his five wins coming by way of double-digit scores.
13524	13524	40	40	target: Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a boom or bust play as demonstrated by three top 15’s and three missed cuts in his last six events, but that’s what you’re looking for in this price range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List).
10865	10865	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Martin Kaymer has been hitting the ball well for a while now It's possible that we don't see the best of him until he returns to the east coast, but Kaymer's record in California is very solid with just three stroke play starts, all in the US Open, all cuts made and two top-15 finishes. Kaymer has a phenomenally good record in the United States, winning two majors and a PLAYERS while also reaching the Match Play final in nearby Arizona, which used to be his winter base before he relocated to Florida.
2275	2275	50	51	target: #6(Jordan Spieth) 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We also saw two rookies(Cody Gribble & John Rahm) get their first wins, a 23-year veteran(Rod Pampling) get his first win in 11 years and two other players (Pat Perez & Brendan Steele) getting their first wins in 5+ years. And most recently, we have seen the #5(Hideki Matsuyama) and #6(Jordan Spieth) players in the world win the last two tournaments. Oh Canada!
700	700	6	6	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Main bets: Chappell 33-1 An 56-1 List 60-1 Cam Smith 110-1 DK article here, already added Curtis Luck... https://t.co/CDCTVal9Fh
8115	8115	54	54	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Englishman has not done the best job of capitalizing on his opportunities the past couple of years, but he’s continued to put himself in the mix week after week this season and has now recorded eight straight finishes of 26th or better coming into the final major (including a T5 from last week). Casey has shown a complete game tee to green in 2017, and comes in ranking eighth on the season in Strokes Gained: Approaches and 15th in Strokes Gained: Around the Greens. While his form at Quail Hollow isn’t spectacular, having only played here once since 2011 (T41 last season), means we can’t really weigh it against him very heavily.
9818	9818	21	21	target: Zach 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He led the SGP stats last week at the Plantation Course which is a big plus coming to Waialae this week. Zach Johnson 33/1  Zach is showing some good early season form and hasn’t finished worse that T23 in his last three starts. He played well at the Safeway Open finishing a respectable T13 and followed that with a T23 at the OHL Classic.
3632	3632	23	23	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bernd Wiesberger 20% – Plays consistent tee to green golf and he’s made both of his cuts at Augusta because of it. Like Haas, one year his putter will catch fire and he’ll spike. THE SINGLES  Emiliano Grillo
576	576	33	34	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This wouldn’t quite be a Billy Horschel story of coming out of nowhere to win, but Casey would be a surprise winner, and makes for a good 2nd golfer in lineups this week. Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week.
1068	1068	2	3	target: Brian Stuard 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: Brian Stuard and Brian Gay, both 125/1. Well they do say two Brians are better than one
7049	7049	91	92	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The BBC lost the event to Sky prior to last year's renewal and as much of a shame as it is to see any live sport lost from terrestrial TV, the coverage 12 months ago was so good that Sky was awarded a BAFTA! Last Ten Winners  2016 - Henrik Stenson -20  2015 - Zach Johnson -15 (playoff)  2014 - Rory McIlroy -17  2013 - Phil Mickelson -3  2012 - Ernie Els -7  2011 - Darren Clarke -5  2010 - Louis Oosthuizen -16  2009 - Stewart Cink -2 (playoff)  2008 - Padraig Harrington +3  2007 - Padraig Harrington -7 (playoff)      What Will it Take to Win the Open Championship? The logical place to start is with the 2008 edition at Royal Birkdale, so here are the stats for the first five and ties.
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
7144	7144	39	39	target: Matsuyama's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a 21-year-old still finding his way in professional golf, it was an out-of-this-world performance, surrounded as he was by links specialists with bags of experience. Muirfield was the last really demanding Open test so the fact it represents Matsuyama's best finish is a positive, although he fared well enough in 2014 and 2015 before struggling last year when arriving in no form and carrying an injury. This time, he comes to the Open with links preparation in the bag courtesy of a top-15 finish in the Irish Open and as one of the most reliable drivers in world golf, there's every hope that he can keep out of trouble and allow his deadly iron play to pick apart the golf course.
10681	10681	21	21	target: Hoge's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at Montreux (again features Poa Annua) in 2017 also interests as Vaughn Taylor is a 2-time winner there. But it's Hoge's form this season which jumps from the page. 7th at TPC Summerlin was the pre-cursor to the Sony Open where the 28 year-old shot 65-65-64 to lead after 54 holes.
9378	9378	27	27	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having the winner in your lineups will be a must to win big on DraftKings. A low owned winner would be even better…  Best bargain basement option:  Grayson Murray $6,400 – If we stack ranked based on the fictional stat of “Strokes Gained: Aggression”, Grayson would be on top of the ranking in more facets than golf. Being aggressive is critical to playing well at Kapalua.
2101	2101	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In the two European Tour events he has played in 2017 (both in February) he has finished T19 at the Dubai Desert Classic and T7 last week in the Maybank Malaysian Open. Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready.
474	474	6	6	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Puerto Rico Open 🔥 takes: - Uihlein picks up the win - Varner with a top ten - Power with a top 20 - Flores with a top 25
3817	3817	1	1	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas – $9,100  Boring Bill Haas is flying under the radar once again. Haas has just eight tags on FanShareSports.com, just over half the amount Adam Hadwin and Tyrrell Hatton have, who surround Haas in the pricing. Haas ranks second in my weighted stat rankings, coming in at 11th in strokes gained approach and first in strokes gained around the green.
8389	8389	32	32	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Seeing him in contention and eventually finishing inside the top-10 at Quail Hollow was enough for me to believe he can win this week, especially given his form on the correlating courses. Day has three top-10’s including a 2nd and a 3rd in his seven starts at Augusta National, whilst he also finished T24 and T4 at the 2012 and 2016 Barclays respectively. Day has won twice in the last nine play-off appearances he has now withdrawn from, with five more top-10’s and two top-15’s in the other six appearances.
1346	1346	5	5	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us. His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s.
4704	4704	46	47	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In order to make birdies on the par-fours, one-putt percentage and SG: putting will ultimately separate the contenders from the coasters. FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Dustin Johnson - $20,700  Jordan Spieth - $18,400  Sergio Garcia - $18,100  Brooks Koepka - $17,400    Cash-game Target (50/50s, Double-Ups): With Johnson and Spieth outside of the ultimate comfort zone in terms of affordability when building a cash-game squad, Koepka will be a popular candidate as the highest-priced player in many lineups. He held the lead after three rounds during the 2016 Byron Nelson, but eventually fell to Garcia in a Sunday playoff.
12070	12070	24	24	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
8573	8573	4	4	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Instead, we are getting Day as only the seventh most expensive golfer on the slate, at an event he has not finished worse than T4 at the past three seasons. What’s also encouraging from his last start is that Day finished the week eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee and third in Driving Distance, suggesting he may finally have found some consistency with his driver, a club that has given him issues all season. Coming off a bit of an embarrassing finish, into an event and time of year he clearly likes, I like Day for a big week here and to hopefully nab his long overdue first win of the year.
12387	12387	10	11	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format. Even though he's coming off a victory at the Valspar Championship and a personal trip to England to pay his respects to the loss of a friend, Paul Casey is the third member of the threesome on my short list.
12892	12892	65	65	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar has finished inside the top 10 in 4 of the last 6 Masters and he really does come alive on hard and fast courses where his combination of approach accuracy and touch on and around the greens will always give him a chance. But away from the place part of the bet giving us value I also think we might see a more assured Kuchar this year after his Royal Birkdale exploits last summer. I think he will have learned a lot from that battle with Spieth and this is obviously his first appearance back at Augusta since.
2019	2019	8	8	target: in”Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Spieth has really not felt like he’s been in”Spieth Mode.” HOWEVER, he has quietly not missed a top 10 this season. I think his putting is quickly getting back into business, and, with the score fest that is Pebble Beach, I look at Spieth as one of the safest cash plays you can make. He’s about as safe a play as I can think in this price range.
5271	5271	9	10	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be high owned, so go big! Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,600 – It’s no secret Kiz is in great form after winning the Dean & Deluca last week. He’s an excellent putter on bentgrass greens, which we will see again this week at Memorial.
4602	4602	3	4	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World’s No. 1 Dustin Johnson, coming off a career best showing at TPC Sawgrass is playing for the third consecutive week. He’s joined by fellow Top 10ers Jason Day (4), Sergio Garcia (5), and Jordan Spieth (6).
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
10076	10076	16	17	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year’s winner, Hudson Swafford, will be there to defend his title. Upper echelon Tour players Brandt Snedeker, Kevin Kisner, Patrick Reed, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Brian Harman, and Kevin Chappell will all tee it up alongside the rest of the Tour regulars. As long as the Tour keeps making stops at courses where the winning score is routinely 24 under par, birdie or better % will continue to be the most important key stat.
5564	5564	19	19	target: Schwartzel's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although both played well and made the top 10, maybe a more restful week would have been better. Certainly, Schwartzel's mood appeared to be up and down and that doesn't bode well. So, we're left with just two players.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
2499	2499	27	27	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given its altitude, Chapultepec will play much less than the scorecard yardage of 7,330 yards (well under 7,000 in fact) so it has to be relevant that Woodland has second places on shorter tracks at the OHL Classic on his last trip to Mexico and the CIMB Classic (twice runner-up) in Malaysia. Those courses measure 6,987 and 7,005 yards respectively so it's simply not true that Woodland needs a beast of a course to show off his length. He can pick and choose his moments (perhaps try and drive a few short par fours) and use other parts of his game and brain over brawn elsewhere.
2756	2756	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
4569	4569	3	3	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to FanShareSports.com, Day is the 29th most tagged golfer so far this week and is the only golfer above $9K with single digit tags. In a week where there will be a ton of fresh faces to DFS golf due to the increase in contest sizes, Day makes for a fantastic GPP play. People will look at his recent form, combined with the recent form of golfers around him and steer clear.
4729	4729	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I cannot remember the last time I saw his price this low, along with his betting odds at 16/1, which seem long for a field of this strength. Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament.
7717	7717	5	5	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Instead, I'll turn to Paul Casey at 30/1. I have a slight feeling I'm playing him at not great odds and expecting something around T5 but surely Casey will throw in something really big soon. Three of his rounds at Royal Birkdale were 67-68-68 so he's doing an awful lot right; the problem is not putting all four together and a Friday 78 on his birthday really did for him at The Open although T11 was still a fine week.
9218	9218	12	12	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's going to be chalky at this price. -- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor.
8089	8089	20	20	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, the only thing that might cause him any confusion next Sunday is if Paul McCartney presents the trophy. Matsuyama may not know The Beatles very well – but how well do you know his career? Try our quiz to find out.
1613	1613	12	12	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda update Knox 45 Berger 50 Ollie 55 Grillo 80 Wiesberger 80 Horschel 100
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
13317	13317	67	68	target: Si Woo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly as I mentioned earlier in the piece it may pay to look at a players past performance at the OHL Mayakoba as this is the other Greg Norman designed course played on the PGA Tour. Finally similarities have been drawn between the Oaks Course and Pete Dye design courses due to the run off areas around the greens and one thing we can’t do is doubt Si Woo’s liking for a Pete Dye design! It is these last three pointers that clinched it for me to roll the dice with Si Woo again this week and I am hoping he can add his name to the list of players who have memorably bounced back from heartbreak one week to win the next.
3472	3472	18	19	target: Angel Cabrera 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has the game to land you a few eagle/birdie streak bonuses if things go well, too. Angel Cabrera ($6,700) – Angel Cabrera’s recent form isn’t something to be admired, as he’s only played twice this season and missed the cut on both occasions. Still, history tells us that when considering whether or not to roster Cabrera at Augusta, his recent form shouldn’t really be weighed very heavily.
1427	1427	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@JazzrazDFS U forgot Paul Casey too
8537	8537	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Furthermore, Finau is a player who has continually gained strokes tee-to-green during that stretch. The value is there on DraftKings and I will be all over Finau in both formats. Gary Woodland – GPP – DK: $7000 FD: $6500  Woodland is a great value (on both sites) given his 70/1 odds to win the tournament.
11691	11691	22	23	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the seven players listed above, three rank inside the top-20 for Strokes-Gained: Approach-the-Green this season, which is another bonus. They are:  Chesson Hadley (5th in SG: Approach)  Ollie Schniederjans (12th in SG: Approach)  Chris Kirk (19th in SG: Approach)  Course experience is helpful here, although Woodland did win in debut in 2011, but course form is general is not a sticking point. Another thing to bear in mind this week is the sheer amount of Par 3’s (five) as well as four Par 5’s.
