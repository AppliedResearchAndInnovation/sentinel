12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
1379	1379	5	6	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Couldn't leave out @WMPhoenixOpen specialist Hideki Matsuyama at 10/1. The Japanese absolutely loves this course ha… https://t.co/0demzJaYtY
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
51	51	13	14	target: Scott Piercy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			At this price he looks a great low ownership GPP play. The Fade:  Scott Piercy ($9,800) – Piercy has played well recently, but having performed when almost 20% owned last week, I feel like he’s going to be heavily owned again. With this track more focused on accuracy, I’m not convinced he can perform as well this week.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
344	344	20	21	target: Cameron Smith 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1309	1309	0	1	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama  Price: $11,000  I wrote last week that I was going to continue to roll with Matsuyama until he cools off, and that's not changing now. Dating back to last fall, here's how the scintillating-hot 24-year-old has fared in his last six events: win, second place to Justin Thomas, win, win, win, second place to Justin Thomas. At some point he's going to finish outside of the Top 2, and there's a good chance that happens at Waialae, where he has three missed cuts (all as an amateur) and a DNF (2015), but he's just playing too well to fade right now.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
380	380	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
61	61	22	22	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
164	164	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
359	359	13	14	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wait until he puts at least a couple good rounds under his belt. Jimmy Walker – $7,600  It’s very unfortunate to watch, but the decline of Jimmy Walker is tough to watch. He has now missed four straight cuts, and last week’s Sony Open might be the most eye opening.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
381	381	14	14	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed the cut the last to years at this place. Aside from Kapalua, Thomas has been playing well. But this course doesn’t seem to fit him and it’s tough not to be weary of a streaky guy on a track that hasn’t suited him.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
413	413	64	65	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He talks about his 1st Masters experience and the impact of Draft Kings and Fantasy Free View in iTunes  139 Clean WGC Cadillac 2016 W/ PGATour Caddie Paul Tesori PGATour Caddie, Paul Tesori talks about life on Tour, caddying for Webb Simpson, caddie preparation, and the Tesori Family Foundation on this week's episode.

332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
21	21	15	15	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I don't care what stats or data you show me, I'm never paying $8,700 for McGirt when Justin Thomas is $8,600. Take my money.
456	456	8	9	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
393	393	27	28	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
116	116	19	19	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
440	440	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
378	378	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.

2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
137	137	25	25	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown comes in ranked 179th in SG: Tee to Green, 179th in GIR% at 63.45%, and 153rd in Par 4 Scoring. I will pass on Brown and load up on List in that price range. Podcast
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
190	190	18	18	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
394	394	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour. But of all the options available, Cink seems to be the best bet to make the cut.
516	516	1	1	target: Lunde 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
292	292	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
6550	6550	21	22	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We aren’t playing a lot of cash games this week due to the field strength, but we love Keegan in GPPs. Gary Woodland $7,500 – Woodland hasn’t sniffed a top ten since we were wearing sweaters in Georgia, but he’s a consistent cut maker with the upside to win potentially. He’s a bomber that can take advantage of these forgiving fairways.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
116	116	19	19	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.

337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
215	215	9	10	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like this sneaky GPP play. Player to avoid  Brooks Koepka $10,200 – This pains us because we have such a man crush on Brooks. We’ve also been on him heavily since the end of March where he was finding form again.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
217	217	41	42	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven’t guessed the name yet, I’m talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
118	118	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Brooks Koepka – $7,700  What in the world is going on with Brooks Koepka. He has played terrible in his last two events and has reverted to snapping drivers in half to help solve his problems.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
333	333	18	18	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse. Looking at my sheet, there are only two other golfers in the $7,500+ range who have scored less DraftKings points per tournament(41) than Rahm.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
397	397	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Couple that with a dozen straight made cuts, and he’s in play this weekend. Fade: Some people may be willing to jump back onto Patrick Reed ($9,100), but I’ll pass after he lost strokes everywhere in Pebble Beach a few weeks ago. Value Golfers ($8,000 – $7,000)  Chesson Hadley ($7,700) is number one in my model this week, which factors in relevant Par 3, Par 4, and Par 5 distances in addition to Proximity and DraftKings Scoring.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone.

Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.

9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.

Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.

Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.

[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
8801	8801	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.

8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
152	152	39	39	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Maybe that’s because he’s in his comfort zone so he can miss a putt every now and again and it doesn’t define whether he wins or loses, so because he can, he probably misses less of them. Harrington on Jordan Spieth:  Jordan clearly has the X-factor. He plays golf pretty much like everybody else but he has that something special and he brings it to Augusta.
117	117	3	3	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic. These unknown greens in Mexico will result in tough 5 – 7 footers and patience will help.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
356	356	6	6	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.

81	81	13	14	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Negative : Si-Woo Kim ($6.4m) looks like 2016 has gone to his head. Luke Donald ($6.5m) doesn't do first appearances of the calendar year very well and Charlie Beljan at $6.7 million. Ask yourself 1) Why is he in the field?
203	203	37	37	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Dustin Johnson ($13000): This is one of the bolder fades to make this season, because DJ fits every aspect needed to succeed here – without rattling off his stats, he’s long, he scores, and he knows how to win. The reason to fade him here is purely based on his salary, and NOT the fact that he missed the Masters with a back injury, because that will just help drive his ownership down and scare people off to the point where DJ will be available at disgustingly low ownership.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.

He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
243	243	59	60	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His Adam Scott-esque putting is the only reason he hasn’t won everything he plays, and that will definitely impact him in a negative way yet again – but on a course where a lot of the field won’t be pouring birdies or getting to the greens, he’ll typically have a chance to two-putt for par at worst. The Fade  David Lingmerth ($8500) – One of the few in this field with course history, the Swede won here back in 2012 when it was a Web.com event, and will garner some ownership just based around that. Unfortunately, where his game is currently is nowhere close to what’s needed to succeed again, beyond his lights-out putting.
107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
388	388	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			But, if you’re chasing that big GPP takedown…have some exposure. Player to Avoid:  Branden Grace $9,100 – Grace is a world class player that thrives on tough courses where scoring is a premium. Pebble does not fit that description.

4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
278	278	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
