4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
9279	9279	26	26	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
6224	6224	41	41	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A good putting week and he'll be very dangerous on a course like this. I don't want to be backing anyone at short prices this week given the lack of course form so therefore I'm happy to take the 50/1 about Bradley rather than the short odds for Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. Bill Haas and Brendan Steele have good credentials but between them they have a win apiece since 2013 so I'm not overly enthused about either at 25/1.
12386	12386	35	35	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's the ultimate wild card because you're likely going to burn him at some point, but you still wouldn't miss him if you didn't. Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
8878	8878	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically, Finau is dominating off of the tee recently, a quick glance at our VIP Research Station shows he is right at the top of the field in this regard. On a course with plenty of scoring opportunities, I like Finau’s chances this week. Keegan Bradley – Cash – DK: $9300  Bradley made ten straight cuts to finish the season.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
12058	12058	32	32	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I especially like him in cash games because his $7,500 price tag gives you a solid cut-maker with upside and saves some salary-cap space for other high-end options. -- Jeff Bergerson  Emiliano Grillo  Although Grillo faded down the stretch at the Hero Indian Open and is flying across the world to play this week, he still offers excellent value at his price tag. He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season.
293	293	77	78	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			As the 146th Open gets underway this week in England, 156 hopefuls will compete for the right to be called Champion Golfer of the Year, and another chapter in the compelling and unpredictable history of this oldest major in golf will be written. Henrik Stenson aims to become the first player to successfully defend The Open title since Padraig Harrington did it in 2007 and 2008, and is joined by a marquee class of major champions including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott. Over the past decade, The Open has favored crafty veterans over young upstarts, with eight of the last 10 Open winners checking in at ages 33 or older.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
540	540	4	4	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
380	380	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
2623	2623	1	1	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
61	61	22	22	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
4126	4126	8	9	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
6759	6759	9	10	target: Zach Johnson). 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steve Stricker from the Cheesehead state and Iowa native Zach Johnson). Take a look at the previous winners below:  2009 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2011 – Steve Stricker (Yes Back to Back to Back)  2012 – Zach Johnson  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2015- Jordan Spieth  2016 – Ryan Moore  You can start to notice a trend with the players that have won here, they are great putters on the green. TPC Deere Run is a Par 71 playing at 7,268 yards.
10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
456	456	8	9	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.

11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.

2621	2621	10	10	target: Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nobody hits a 3-wood with more confidence and accuracy than Stenson. Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.

Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.

He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.

12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
417	417	42	43	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			South America: Emiliano Grillo – The Argentine is on a lovely run of form as he looks set to clinch the Rookie of the Year award on the PGA Tour. He finished in a tie for second last week, just one behind Patrick Reed, and also tied for 13th and 8th at the USPGA and Olympics. He’s up to sixth in the FedEx Cup and up to a career-high 25th in the world.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
1006	1006	5	6	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whee Kim - $7,400  5. Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
190	190	18	18	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods – $10,000  Personal note – I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.
3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
516	516	1	1	target: Lunde 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
292	292	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
10975	10975	19	20	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am looking for Pieters to draw on his good memories here and put his good form to use. Keegan Bradley ($7.6K) – Keegan Bradley seems to be returning to his Major-winning ways this year. He spent most of last year getting sorted with putting grips and changes.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
486	486	34	35	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston. Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week.
6455	6455	1	1	target: Randolph 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jonathan Randolph ($6900) – A better putter than his SG: Putting rank of 100 would suggest, Randolph is very good at one-putting (40.9%) and is nails from 4-8’ (7 th in 148 attempts) which isn’t listed as a “key” stat, but is encompassed in the 5-10’ putting range that has some importance. Randolph is great from short distances and like Vaughn is known for his accuracy. He missed the cut in 2015 (only attempt) but has shown better form in making seven of his last ten events, including a T8.
11494	11494	19	20	target: Thomas Pieters, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a somewhat risky option but is priced modestly given he won the last time he teed it up. Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome.

Yahoo!
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
3688	3688	48	49	target: Branden Grace, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Perhaps remembering the early days of golf betting and the advice of Keith Elliott, I've always tended to back players at Hilton Head who didn't put themselves in the heat of battle at Augusta the week before. And this week's defending champion, Branden Grace, fits the bill. Grace was a nearest-the-finish T27 at Augusta but, rather than view that as a slight disappointment, he was probably relatively pleased given that he'd previously missed his last three cuts at the Masters.
5822	5822	27	27	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That win was at Royal Aberdeen which I alluded to earlier. Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week.
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
5686	5686	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Dufner 2 weeks ago and Bello last week recency bias is real and he could be that guy this week after his missed cut at the St. Jude, which I’m not worried about at all. Middle Range  Paul Casey $8,400 – He currently sits as the second highest rated golfer in my model. Knock on wood he hasn’t missed a cut since I mushed him with my One and Done pick in Hawaii.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6207	6207	56	75	target: David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Boo Weekley; 3) Ben Crane; 3) Spencer Levin; 4) Tim Wilkinson; 5) Kyle Stanley; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Jim Herman / Daniel Summerhays; 9) David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A.

6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.

11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
4498	4498	23	23	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
192	192	86	87	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The other surprise name here is Nick Taylor, which tells us as much as we need to know about the strength of this event. Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.

890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!

9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.

Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.

327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.

Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
8801	8801	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!
608	608	2	2	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
4879	4879	46	47	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson are both two-time winners, Jordan Spieth was runner-up in 2015 before winning last year and 2015 champ Chris Kirk had a previous top five as well as making the top 15 the year before his win. So I'm naturally drawn to Kevin Kisner, who has a T10 and a T5 in the last two years. Kisner recovered from an over-par opener with 66-69-66 to sneak into the top 10 last year and in 2015 he posted three 67s and a 69 to finish just two shots behind winner Kirk.
1403	1403	5	5	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyJesusDFS Did u factor in Noren hangover?
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
8930	8930	3	4	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Knox  11. Anirban Lahiri  12. Peter Uihlein  13.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
6830	6830	11	13	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, let’s try and cultivate some John Deere Picks! Top Tier  Charles Howell III $9,000 – I like that we can roster him a little discount from last week. He hasn’t missed the cut here since 2012, which was his only one in 7 appearances.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
8143	8143	11	12	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Enough with the BS let’s get to some picks. Winner Section  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Disclaimer: I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Jordan Spieth. Well mostly just hate.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
514	514	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I will be spending 55 minutes of our 1 hr podcast telling @KendoVT how much I love Finau this week https://t.co/726ehHw8QO
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome.

10954	10954	39	40	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Targeting a multitude of mid-tier golfers might be a better choice, as strong plays like Branden Grace, Tommy Fleetwood, Alex Noren and Marc Leishman can all be had for less than $10,000. Other strong targets for this format include Paul Casey, Branden Steele, Ollie Schniederjans, Martin Kaymer, Charles Howell III, Martin Laird and Brandon Harkins. Tournaments – It feels like a week where Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could easily go under-owned due to poor recent form or poor course history.
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.

8819	8819	38	38	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back him win only at 9/2. In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up.

4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
13317	13317	67	68	target: Si Woo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly as I mentioned earlier in the piece it may pay to look at a players past performance at the OHL Mayakoba as this is the other Greg Norman designed course played on the PGA Tour. Finally similarities have been drawn between the Oaks Course and Pete Dye design courses due to the run off areas around the greens and one thing we can’t do is doubt Si Woo’s liking for a Pete Dye design! It is these last three pointers that clinched it for me to roll the dice with Si Woo again this week and I am hoping he can add his name to the list of players who have memorably bounced back from heartbreak one week to win the next.
