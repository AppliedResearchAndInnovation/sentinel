12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ‚Äôs 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson‚Äôs also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ‚Äôs recorded 11 rounds in the 60‚Äôs at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn‚Äôt shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players ‚Äî Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) ‚Äî and this is a much deeper field than you‚Äôd expected at the second event of the calendar year.
7360	7360	12	12	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's the same game plan I had last time we were here." Stenson didn't have his best stuff at the Scottish Open last week but he closed with a 68 for T26 and his best Open results have come when he's warmed up on the links in Scotland. He may also have noted that Padraig Harrington came to Royal Birkdale as the defending champion in 2008 and retained the Claret Jug.
287	287	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
4634	4634	178	178	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 ‚Äì 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 ‚Äì although a full $1500 more than the next guy ‚Äì Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it‚Äôs not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn‚Äôt come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He‚Äôs missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he‚Äôs finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na ‚Ä¶ Since a solo third here in 2011, he‚Äôs 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III ‚Ä¶ I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
51	51	13	14	target: Scott Piercy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			At this price he looks a great low ownership GPP play. The Fade:  Scott Piercy ($9,800) ‚Äì Piercy has played well recently, but having performed when almost 20% owned last week, I feel like he‚Äôs going to be heavily owned again. With this track more focused on accuracy, I‚Äôm not convinced he can perform as well this week.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
826	826	12	12	target: GAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 üî• HADWIN 150 üî• STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn‚Äôt finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn‚Äôt in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He‚Äôs admitted he‚Äôs still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping ‚Äì in which the dreaded word ‚Äúyips‚Äù were brought up for his short-game struggles.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph ‚Äì a dip we often see from winners ‚Äì but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he‚Äôs led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he‚Äôs had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
287	287	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I‚Äôll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn‚Äôt.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I‚Äôm going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau‚Ä¶ Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn‚Äôt heavily restric driver usage.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week ‚Äì for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama ‚Äì $11,500  This is Hideki‚Äôs event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs üí∞ Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a ¬£20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he‚Äôs just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I‚Äôm fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he‚Äôs currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn‚Äôt in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
61	61	22	22	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He‚Äôs one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn‚Äôt ‚Äútamed‚Äù in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed‚Äôs inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He‚Äôs not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown ‚Ä¶ Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
308	308	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts and hasn‚Äôt played since the Travelers. There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood ‚Äì $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan.
359	359	13	14	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wait until he puts at least a couple good rounds under his belt. Jimmy Walker ‚Äì $7,600  It‚Äôs very unfortunate to watch, but the decline of Jimmy Walker is tough to watch. He has now missed four straight cuts, and last week‚Äôs Sony Open might be the most eye opening.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead‚Äôs greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber ‚Ä¶ An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he‚Äôs fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
381	381	14	14	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He‚Äôs missed the cut the last to years at this place. Aside from Kapalua, Thomas has been playing well. But this course doesn‚Äôt seem to fit him and it‚Äôs tough not to be weary of a streaky guy on a track that hasn‚Äôt suited him.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) ‚Äì Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.

332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It‚Äôs worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) ‚Äì Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman ‚Ä¶ Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
393	393	27	28	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 ‚Äì This is another week where we aren‚Äôt crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don‚Äôt mind like, McGirt, O‚ÄôHair, Barber, and Armour.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm‚Äôs 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn‚Äôt the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm‚Äôs time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven‚Äôt repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That‚Äôs generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio‚Äôs T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ‚Äôs 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ‚Äôs Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn‚Äôt it? Between that and his history here.. I can‚Ä¶ https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.

440	440	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn‚Äôt either.
302	302	25	26	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood ‚Äì $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan. He was a joy to watch and has the approach game to put him with the World‚Äôs best.

Despite missing out on the first major, he‚Äôs still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.

From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
137	137	25	25	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown comes in ranked 179th in SG: Tee to Green, 179th in GIR% at 63.45%, and 153rd in Par 4 Scoring. I will pass on Brown and load up on List in that price range. Podcast
142	142	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don‚Äôt see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he‚Äôll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn‚Äôt worry too much about his current struggles. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week ‚Äì for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods ‚Äì $10,000  Personal note ‚Äì I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I‚Äôd have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt ‚Ä¶ Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
292	292	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day ‚Äì GPP ‚Äì DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‚Äòelite‚Äô category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we‚Äôre all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% ‚Äì His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% ‚Äì Record speaks for itself.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen‚Ä¶  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn‚Äôt missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he‚Äôs comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can‚Äôt look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia‚Äôs ownership down.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He‚Äôs in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler ‚Ä¶ This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week‚Äôs Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.

278	278	10	11	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Not sure I could think of a worse course for Thomas Pieters than PGA National.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt ‚Äì $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
217	217	41	42	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven‚Äôt guessed the name yet, I‚Äôm talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn‚Äôt mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
425	425	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The win still eludes him but his high-class consistency is appealing to fantasy managers. Tyrrell Hatton  Hatton was in the middle of a golden spell last year when a T10 here was the Mexican filling sandwiched between Florida T4s at the Honda and Bay Hill. He missed the cut at PGA National last week but prior to that was third in Abu Dhabi (3rd GIR) and let‚Äôs remember that he‚Äôs the World No.
333	333	18	18	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse. Looking at my sheet, there are only two other golfers in the $7,500+ range who have scored less DraftKings points per tournament(41) than Rahm.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson ‚Äì $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington‚Äôs egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well ‚Äì Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.

Despite missing out on the first major, he‚Äôs still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.

316	316	22	23	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don‚Äôt plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 ‚Äì We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
112	112	33	33	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
352	352	8	10	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?

Jason Day ‚Äì GPP ‚Äì DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‚Äòelite‚Äô category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
341	341	21	22	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Have a good feeling about a guy who is long off the tee and can make birdies in bunches. DraftKings bargain: Stewart Cink ($7,000). T-17 or better in two of three CIMB starts, and barely missed out on making it to East Lake last season.

Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row. Charley loves Texas, but I really think that blow-up at Augusta will be on his mind for some time ‚Äì at 40-years-old, he really isn‚Äôt going to get many more chances to win a major.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it‚Äôs like to battle it out on Sunday.

9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard‚Äôs 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard‚Äôs case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.

Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) ‚Äì Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn‚Äôt even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.

Russell Knox ‚Ä¶ If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.

94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
273	273	15	15	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			1 has been a shadow of his 2016 self in 2017. It‚Äôs completely understandable, but Day recently missed the cut at the U.S. Open and the Travelers Championship and has yet to show that he can putt nearly as well as he did last season. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  Gerry Ahern  Projected champion: Justin Rose.

Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.

152	152	39	39	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Maybe that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs in his comfort zone so he can miss a putt every now and again and it doesn‚Äôt define whether he wins or loses, so because he can, he probably misses less of them. Harrington on Jordan Spieth:  Jordan clearly has the X-factor. He plays golf pretty much like everybody else but he has that something special and he brings it to Augusta.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance.

Here‚Äôs a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he‚Äôs still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
11206	11206	42	43	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National‚Äôs layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this ‚Äústicky‚Äù strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 ‚Äì Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week‚Äôs Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn‚Äôt have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it‚Äôs a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O‚ÄôHair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
243	243	59	60	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His Adam Scott-esque putting is the only reason he hasn‚Äôt won everything he plays, and that will definitely impact him in a negative way yet again ‚Äì but on a course where a lot of the field won‚Äôt be pouring birdies or getting to the greens, he‚Äôll typically have a chance to two-putt for par at worst. The Fade  David Lingmerth ($8500) ‚Äì One of the few in this field with course history, the Swede won here back in 2012 when it was a Web.com event, and will garner some ownership just based around that. Unfortunately, where his game is currently is nowhere close to what‚Äôs needed to succeed again, beyond his lights-out putting.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn‚Äôt totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner‚Äôs circle. Rickie Fowler.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
388	388	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			But, if you‚Äôre chasing that big GPP takedown‚Ä¶have some exposure. Player to Avoid:  Branden Grace $9,100 ‚Äì Grace is a world class player that thrives on tough courses where scoring is a premium. Pebble does not fit that description.

153	153	2	2	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Jason Dufner, $7,100  Dufner did book a 24th in 2012 and a 20th in 2013. But his last three trips to the Masters have resulted in MC, 49th, MC.
172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
142	142	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don‚Äôt see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day ‚Äì $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course‚Äôs website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he‚Äôs by far the most expensive player on the board. It‚Äôs hard to deny the incredible run he‚Äôs been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don‚Äôt look for Charl‚Äôs price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‚ÄòT‚Äô and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I‚Äôll be playing him in all formats.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 ‚Äì Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 ‚Äì Solid course history and form. I‚Äôd play in all formats.
278	278	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn‚Äôt missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a ¬£20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
