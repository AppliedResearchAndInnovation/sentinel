7625	7625	24	24	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively. They’re historically pricey while DJ is around his average; that should affect ownership, and indeed DJ is projected for the most ownership this week at 26-30 percent in our Models.
10274	10274	61	77	target: Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even with a handful of the world’s elite (Rory, Sergio, Stenson, Fleetwood) teeing it up in the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, Torrey Pines will host four of the Top 10 ranked players: Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler, and 11 of the Top 25 once you add Marc Leishman, Charley Hoffman, Alex Noren, Day, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed into the mix. Beyond that, factor in a slew of legit up-and-comers like Patrick Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Ollie Schniderjans, Si WOOOO Kim, Peter Uihlein, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray and Cameron Smith, with a cadre of recognizable names for the viewers: Phil Mickelson (making his 29th career start at this event), two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Jimmy Walker, K.J. Choi, J.B. Holmes and Stewart Cink and you have an event that seems pretty accessible to almost everyone.
12781	12781	11	12	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charl Schwartzel: 30th Houston/47th Bay Hill/24th Doral/14th PGA National/8th Abu Dhabi. Phil Mickelson: 35th Houston/30th Bay Hill/14th Doral/24th TPC Scottsdale. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their wave and winning score since 2010.
3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3858	3858	14	15	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like him in cash or GPP formats on DraftKings this week. Value Plays  Matthew Fitzpatrick $8,300 – FitzMagic is in wonderful form having not missed a cut since January. He’s a total ball striker with accuracy off the tee being his specialty.
2268	2268	29	29	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005. Scott is hitting just under 75% of greens in regulation and is one of the biggest hitters on tour. With a great record here and decent current form the Aussie could be one to watch here.
4151	4151	35	35	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior. While he struggles with the flatstick, Grace is an adept approach player, placing 13th on Tour in strokes gained: approach last year. Middling  Ian Poulter: $7,900  Poults has never needed it more.
122	122	12	12	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson, Spieth, Mickelson, Walker and Koepka have all safely qualified. Holmes, Watson, Kuchar, Fowler and Furyk amongst those down to 22nd in the current standings (see above) still have a shot at qualifying automatically this week. From there Davis Love III announces 3 of his 4 Captain's Picks after the BMW Championship (3rd of 4 events), with his final selection being announced after the Tour Championship.
10406	10406	12	13	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus. Nine Bridges: Justin Thomas; EW Places: Leishman, Cam Smith, Whee Kim, Brown, Lahiri, List, Lovemark. TPC Summerlin: Patrick Cantlay; EW Places: Whee Kim, Cejka, Hadley, Kizzire, Hossler, Hoge Bradley, DeChambeau.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
67	67	26	26	target: Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
10205	10205	13	14	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, it may be enough to keep other owners away. -- Zach Turcotte  Tiger Woods  It is difficult to target a golfer making his first competitive start with FedEx Cup points on the line since this event last year, but in this case, the golfer is Tiger Woods. There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event.
2028	2028	11	11	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
7173	7173	30	31	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course was last played in 2008 when Padraig Harrington took home the Claret Jug. In that year a few current players finished high up on the leaderboard; Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey all finished within the top 10. All three of these players share a few traits within their games; they are all accurate off of the tee and great tee-to-green.
9279	9279	26	26	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
5603	5603	47	48	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The cost per session was $125, albeit free for me, and worth every penny for those who glided four rounds with the most mechanically gifted swinger of the golf club maybe ever. I don't know when it hit me Sunday, but at some point I realized, damn, Dustin Johnson is kind of built to win U.S. Opens.
7704	7704	21	22	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
231	231	13	14	target: J Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five for Pebble Beach: C Smith 125/1, S Cink 150/1, M Thompson 175/1, J Hahn 200/1, G Owen 200/1. 365 have nice top20 prices for latter four
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
7176	7176	30	30	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
8978	8978	2	3	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 125/1 Paddy Power The competition is less fierce than a normal PGA Tour event and his ball-striking should out him in contention. He might excel in the early part of the season away from the spotlight.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
1252	1252	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes (7.4k) - not accurate off the tee yet has 33/6/2/23 L4 here. (DA was under 45% each time). Wish his for… https://t.co/MjIQAYaJcI
4057	4057	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
73	73	25	26	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH OUT!!!! 2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Ryan Moore $10,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Brandt Snedeker $9,800  Kevin Na $9,100  2016 John Deere Classic DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Rafa Cabrera-Bello $8,900  William McGirt $8,700  Scott Piercy $8,500  Kevin Kisner $8,300  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Ben Martin $8,000  Jason Dufner $7,900  Billy Horschel $7,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Luke Donald $7,000  Camilo Villegas $6,400  Roberto Castro $6,000  Seung-Yul Noh $5,600  Rickie Fowler $11,700  Webb Simpson $10,200  Russell Henley $9,000  JB Holmes $8,100  Shane Lowry $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

7360	7360	12	12	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's the same game plan I had last time we were here." Stenson didn't have his best stuff at the Scottish Open last week but he closed with a 68 for T26 and his best Open results have come when he's warmed up on the links in Scotland. He may also have noted that Padraig Harrington came to Royal Birkdale as the defending champion in 2008 and retained the Claret Jug.
9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
6224	6224	41	41	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A good putting week and he'll be very dangerous on a course like this. I don't want to be backing anyone at short prices this week given the lack of course form so therefore I'm happy to take the 50/1 about Bradley rather than the short odds for Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. Bill Haas and Brendan Steele have good credentials but between them they have a win apiece since 2013 so I'm not overly enthused about either at 25/1.
8933	8933	3	3	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray  16. Scott Hend  17. Adam Hadwin  18.
12386	12386	35	35	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's the ultimate wild card because you're likely going to burn him at some point, but you still wouldn't miss him if you didn't. Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
5361	5361	11	11	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year. Brooks Koepka, $10100 – Finishing second, third, and 19th in three Memphis starts is a good track record for anyone, let alone the fourth-highest ranked player in the field. Koepka is plenty long and posted five top-16 finishes over his last seven starts.
1564	1564	4	4	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@genesisopen Picks Berger 40 Ollie 45 Noren 45 Pieters 45 Chappy 50 Finau 66 Many many DJ parlays/exotics,… https://t.co/EItr2mjfNJ

10594	10594	80	81	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley. Plus, Ian Poulter, Steve Stricker, and Ryan Moore will be making their 2018 PGA debuts.
6703	6703	6	6	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy early and often! VALUE  Nick Taylor ($7,600) – Feeling generous, are we DK? Taylor has been red hot lately, and the only reason he isn’t priced even higher than this is because his putter tends to let him down from time to time.
4634	4634	178	178	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
6153	6153	28	29	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			14 in the Power Rankings), Harris English (Sleeper) and Chez Reavie (Draw in the Fantasy Insider). That you've come this far without a mention of two-time Travelers champion Bubba Watson says all that you need to know. Because of an inconsistent 2017 perhaps due to the change in his ball, he sets up as an ironic contrarian at the tournament where he's the all-time earnings leader, but only if you're way back in the pack.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
10967	10967	17	17	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still, he missed the cut. Coming into Riviera off a missed cut and in questionable form makes Scott a decent GPP play this week. Since we know most golfers will be playing from the rough this week, I peeked at guys who make birdies from the rough.
3028	3028	24	25	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
2862	2862	18	19	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you want to go contrarian, Graeme McDowell is the guy in this group. Hideki Matsyuama, Justin Rose, Paul Casey, & Kevin Kisner – Don’t worry about Hideki’s recent struggles, his ball striking and short game are still elite, which is necessary at Bay Hill… Rose has four Top 15s in his last five trips to Orlando along with three Top 5 finishes in his past five overall. As a bonus, he’s second in the field from the key Par 3 Range, trailing only Martin Kaymer… Casey has just been playing too well to not pop at some point.
3633	3633	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price suckered me in. Paul Casey 40% – Speaking of way too cheap. Here we have Paul Casey.
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
7784	7784	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s arguably the world’s best off the tee on a course that rewards long and accurate driving. Rickie Fowler, $9000 – Fowler has showed a knack for Firestone with four top-10 finishes in just seven career starts. Since June, Fowler has racked up three top-5 finishes and a 22nd at the Open two weeks back.
2757	2757	24	24	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row. Not only can Haas dominate the Par 3’s, he is also top 20 in SG: Tee to Green.
204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
8610	8610	70	71	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This section is going to detail a few of the golfers who have the best fantasy value compared to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Marc Leishman 66-1 $6,900 Tony Finau 7,100 and 80-1  Russell Knox $7,100 and 125-1  Emiliano Grillo $6,900 and 175-1 Adam Scott 34-1 $7,900 Gary Woodland $8,000 and 100-1  Webb Simpson $8,200 and 55-1  Charley Hoffman $8,300 and 50-1  Course Horses  Phil Mickelson loves being aggressive, and this course has suited him well in the past. Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and also has a 10th and fourth in his past six visits.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
5639	5639	0	1	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8,800): Scott has been up and down ever since the Masters but his recent finish at the FedEx St. Jude suggests a man whose long game might be finally peaking. Scott was top five in SG: approaches and tee to green in Memphis and has actually been putting better than his career averages recently too. For DFS, he’s well under priced at just $8,800 and probably a better play from a pure value perspective than anyone in the 9k range.
6235	6235	6	6	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10200 – The world’s ninth-ranked player heads the field and represents a good value after a week of rest following his recent top-5 finish at the U.S. Open. Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form.
8142	8142	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another guy to watch on Fanshare, but I can’t see him above 25% with all the names above him. Rickie Fowler $10,700 – He has a win at Quail in 2012 and a 4th in 2016. I think he figured something out last week after a bit of a letdown at The Open.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
2036	2036	20	21	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the weather is truly as bad as it looks, I also like Brandt to contend more than others. Tom:  Justin Rose $9,200 – Rosey has teed it up twice in the States in 2017, and twice finished in the top 5. When players of his caliber do this, it is best to just ride the hot hand.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
12032	12032	41	42	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Though Arnold isn’t physically present, his legend lives on in what should be another fantastic close to the Florida Swing. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Marc Leishman  2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Matt Every  2014 – Matt Every  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Martin Laird  2010 – Ernie Els  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Tiger Woods    Key Stats to Winning this Week    • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green  • Strokes Gained Putting  • Par-5 Scoring    Champion’s Profile    As a longer track with some penalizing rough, it’s a must for players to drive the ball well, both long and straight. The length becomes a nice advantage on the reachable par-5 holes and longer par-4s that prove demanding over four rounds.
93	93	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sleeper of the Week  Our weekly pick for you is one that you may not expect. Graham DeLaet: He scored a top 5 here in 2012 and was 20th in the Olympics a few weeks ago. He also posted a top 10 in July, so he is close.
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
2850	2850	47	47	target: Hadwin’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he has improved with his irons approaching the green this season, ranking 59th in GIR percentage at 70%, compared to his 66.2% average GIR over his last two seasons. I hate rostering a player with bad course history, but in this case I really do think Hadwin’s current form outweighs any worries I have about him here at Copperhead. At $6,800, we are getting one of the most consentient players on The Tour this season at a serious discount in a very weak field.
11901	11901	26	27	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			282 yards (48th), 60.7% fairways (51st), 72.2% greens in regulation (7th), 33'8" proximity to hole (11th), 60.0 % scrambling (34th), 1.65 putts per GIR (3rd). 2013, Tiger Woods (-13). 279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st).
6104	6104	65	66	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For tournaments, I will be looking to build around a core the same core for the most part but also using some contrarian plays that could be lower owned with similar upside.

826	826	12	12	target: GAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
6386	6386	10	10	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TPC Potomac features six par 4s of 450-500 yards, which Fowler has performed well on this year (8th in Birdie or Better in that range). It’s extremely difficult to fade Fowler given his play this season. Justin Thomas ($10,900) is the third most expensive golfer and comes in off of a missed cut at the Travelers Championship.
1249	1249	65	66	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
9004	9004	11	12	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Purse: $7 million; $1.26 million (winner); 500 FEC points. Defending Champion: Justin Thomas defended his championship as he defeated Hideki Matsuyama by three shots. Notes: 78 players; 72 holes (no cut).
8090	8090	19	20	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My shortlist was massive this week although very few really struck me as potential winners. Of those that did, Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel were the most notable within our price range. Both have majors pedigree, excellent Florida records and are long off the tee.
2192	2192	33	34	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
1209	1209	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he'll have hit the reset button since placing 10th in Tiger's tournament and he's definitely worth following in this event. Hopefully, this is the best market for us to fully cash in and it's worth pointing out that with four payout places, Reed could finish eighth in the tournament and we'd still edge a profit on him. With the front of the betting so strong, it's hard to find much space for any bigger-priced players.
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
5576	5576	10	10	target: Fowler’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite. A missed cut at the FedEx St Jude Classic aside – more on that shortly – Fowler might just have the most complete profile currently and is well capable of putting himself in position for victory once more. His latest opportunity to land himself a major came at the Masters in April and although perfectly poised after three rounds, it didn’t happen for the Californian as he drifted away to a T11 with a closing 76.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
9716	9716	1	1	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week. Thomas for a second-straight week will serve as defending champion, but don’t let last week’s performance scare you away. Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week.
7928	7928	43	43	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie enters the week as the 11th-ranked golfer in the world and is coming off three solid weeks – Bridgestone is still pending so it’s excluded – with finishes of T22, T3, and T5 before his last missed cut at the St. Jude. Fowler also finished T11 at Augusta, and although he’s yet to win a major his track record with high finishes in majors combined with his track record at Quail Hollow are positive signs. In the last six years at this course, the diminutive candidate for BPTNWAM has won (2012), made the cut with mediocre finishes twice, and finished T4 last year.
8466	8466	40	41	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And once more, he's right on the bubble when it comes to qualifying for a team event - this time the Presidents Cup, in which he was disappointing two years ago and will doubtless therefore be keen to make amends. Patrick Reed  You know as well as I do that he'll be selected as a wild card regardless, but that was also the case a year ago yet the Texan wanted to take care of business for himself. There's absolutely no doubt that his sensational performance at Hazeltine, capped by that Sunday singles win over McIlroy, can be traced back to the way he hauled himself over the line at Bethpage.
816	816	19	20	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick to Click: DJ was awful last week; I’ll do much better this week. Winners picked this year: 1  Brooks Koepka – $10,700 Out of alt he guys priced 10k and above, he’s the only one I’d play at a high clip. Chris Kirk is playing very well right now, but I think Koepka is going to win, and soon, and it might be in Vegas this week.
11370	11370	40	41	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a plethora of players vying for a place in the six-man line-up for the official European Tour fantasy game and the addition of some top Americans, who are now eligible, adds to the difficulty for gamers. Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood will surely be a staple of most line-ups given their exploits here last year while Dutchman Joost Luiten could be a big-value outsider to cause a few waves. One To Swerve  Tyrrell Hatton’s T10 last year may have been based on the fact he was in fantastic form rather than loved the course.
12810	12810	14	15	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			AUGUSTA, Georgia — Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo is buying into the hype, saying Tiger Woods will “threaten” in his quest for a 15th major championship this week. Woods is on a mission to add to his 79 PGA TOUR victories and 14 majors, returning to Augusta National for the first time in a playing capacity since a T17 finish in 2015. Woods has already collected the green jacket four times, but not since 2005.
5074	5074	62	62	target: Fleetwood’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His SG: Tee to Green would put him second after only Dustin Johnson if he had enough qualified rounds, and his 0.843 SG: Approach would have him sixth – it is a small tracked sample, but those numbers combined with his results on the European Tour show that this Brit is no fluke. The approach numbers are the most tantalizing aspect of Fleetwood’s game for this course, and although his PGA GIR% of 61.51% doesn’t jump out as anything special, he’s currently ranked 2nd in that category across the pond (82.6%, although the Euro Tour average is higher overall than the PGA’s, at 68.7%). Fleetwood’s scrambling also leaves something to be desired, but a large part of that has come not from the wedge but from poor putting.
3652	3652	17	17	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have to take the chalk in this group (Kuchar/Snedeker/Furyk), Kuch is the best bet. Tyrrell Hatton & Jason Dufner – As with Grace last year, the missed cut for Hatton at Augusta may actually work in his favor. Expectations have been lowered and he got the extra two days of downtime.
578	578	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will. He’s long enough to suit this course and with 9 consecutive tournaments of being under par, Reed has the scoring ability to win everything come Sunday.
4333	4333	1	1	target: Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Watney ... Not that there was ever a doubt, but he’s playing with a new lease on status, so to speak. For finishing among the throng at T5 (with partner Charley Hoffman) at TPC Louisiana, Watney met the terms of his Major Medical Extension by $3,091. He still had 10 starts to burn and wasn’t in danger of reduced playing time, but it was a nice way to celebrate his 36th birthday (April 25).
11523	11523	17	18	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The second WGC of the 2017-18 season also presents career-changing potential for non-members. In last year's edition, Tommy Fleetwood, Ross Fisher, Thomas Pieters and Tyrrell Hatton recorded top 10s in Mexico City. Each would go on to total enough non-member FedExCup points to secure fully exempt status this season.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
11902	11902	25	26	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st). 2012, Tiger Woods (-13). 295 yards (11th), 64.3% fairways (29th), 79.2% greens in regulation (1st), 36'4" proximity to hole (20th), 60.0% scrambling (10th), 1.84 putts per GIR (52nd).
16	16	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
1142	1142	5	6	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka - $8,900  3. Rickie Fowler - $7,900  4. Russell Knox - $7,400  5.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
5777	5777	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two spots remaining, we have $18,300 left to work with. Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler . FanDuel is back and they have a new format.
6792	6792	66	67	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
6500	6500	17	19	target: Tyrone Van Aswegen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			During his streak, he's up nearly six percentage points and slots a season-best T44 in the stat. Tyrone Van Aswegen … No golfer puts four rounds together regularly, but the absence of it entirely is the ironic constant among rank-and-filers. When expectations need to remain high to sustain a livelihood at this level, any spark can be monumental, not to mention lucrative.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
6119	6119	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(gpp)  Anirban Lahiri ($7,500) – Par 4 scoring machine when he’s on and he definitely has the ability to come out hot. (gpp)  Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Had a MC last week but I’m not worried. He fits this course and has been solid all season.
7703	7703	4	5	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.

6579	6579	30	30	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The scrubs in these tournaments are trash, and the upside a top tiered golfer offers isn’t much higher than someone in the $9K range. That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls.
12168	12168	3	4	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fervor that Tiger Woods manufactured at last week's Valspar Championship was all the most skeptical needed to close the chapter on any residual doubt in his latest return to competition. His performance aligned with candor, honesty, adjusted expectations and the glint of his old and still familiar fire. It reminded us of all that once was good and that he could be again.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
1985	1985	15	15	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I hurt way too much last week. Price isn't the only thing to like about Reed as he has excellent course history with finishes of T22, T4, T7 and T21 last season. He ranks inside the Top 1o of West Coast Positive players and although the stats don't show it thus far, he is an amazing scrambler.
801	801	6	6	target: CASEY, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WellsFargoChampionship win: DJ in mix: RAHM, CASEY, webb, BRYAN, berger 💣: poston, gay 5/1 is your only hope. 💰e… https://t.co/OzxPWUtlnc
8931	8931	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That makes him a very nice rebound candidate this week. Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
5340	5340	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On to the Picks! Next Day Air  Brooks Koepka $11,500 – He finished second here last year, 3rd the year before and 19th in 2014. I watched him all last week on Shot Tracker and his biggest issue seemed to be making putts.
2472	2472	18	18	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be in for some positive regression this week. When looking at our European Tour comp courses, Garcia fits. He’s especially fond of Crans Sur Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters.
9381	9381	4	5	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Embed from Getty Images  Kevin Kisner $8,400 – We’ve spoken to a couple of caddies on the PGA Tour that say the most important factors at Kapalua are putting, wedge play, and staying aggressive. Enter Kevin Kisner. He’s only outranked by two other players in the field over the last five years in SG: Putting and 3 Putt Avoidance (Spieth & Brooks).
11040	11040	13	13	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At his worst, he’s a grinder who can get you to the weekend. Keegan Bradley  If you have a pacemaker, please, for your own safety, do not roster Keegan. The stress will have you in the emergency room.
11	11	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
1817	1817	13	13	target: Berger: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy him before Bubba Watson ($8,300) or Padraig Harrington ($8,500). Throwing Darts  Daniel Berger: $7,000  Berger didn't have his best stuff at Torrey Pines where he missed the cut, but it's not a course he plays well. He tied for 10th at the WMPO in 2015, so he's proved capable at the desert course.
13228	13228	14	15	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a decent week at Augusta and should do well here with his length. Luke Donald – It’s hard to look past Donald at Hilton Head, despite him never winning there. His record speaks for itself so he should contend.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
245	245	11	11	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
13156	13156	63	63	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey won the Valspar Championship last month, his first main Tour victory since 2014, and we all know about Phil Mickelson's 5 year drought ending with a cracking victory at the WGC-Mexico Championship the week before Casey's victory. So in Simpson we have a 4-time PGA Tour winner who hasn't won since October 2013. Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one.
7688	7688	2	3	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
11875	11875	2	3	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
5377	5377	28	28	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s fired just one round in the 60’s since April, and the price is too high to risk for a guy who can’t seem to find a top-10. Scott has averaged 58% of his fairways this year, ranking back at 126th which will not suit this golf course. We’d much rather roll with the safer Molinari or pay up for Fowler.
7838	7838	8	9	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign. It will be interesting to see what Brooks’ ownership will be this week on DK, but I’d venture to guess he’ll be going off as lesser-owned than any of the players above him, making him a perfect gpp target.
815	815	3	3	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5. Strokes Gained Approach to Green – Simpson, Garrigus, Cejka, Taylor, DeLeat  Player Focus: The Shriners  On the Rise: Pretty bad week overall.
304	304	37	37	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open. When the disappointment fades, and it will quickly, Fowler should be thrilled to have been in contention again. We know he likes this track, having chased down Henrik Stenson to win here last year.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
1399	1399	19	21	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
2191	2191	18	18	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
1373	1373	6	6	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winners for this week. Xander 100/1, Harkins 150/1 and Brazel 140/1. All ew.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
11875	11875	2	2	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
1788	1788	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are a few names to consider at every different price level. High-Priced  Hideki Matsuyama ($11,700) – It’s not that I don’t like Spieth – it’s that I couldn’t justify putting anyone higher on this list than Matsuyama. He has been as hot as anyone in golf since last fall, consistently playing well enough to make cuts and at least getting into position to challenge for a top spot on the leaderboard week in and week out.
3253	3253	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la creme  Rickie Fowler: $10,000  Spieth and Stenson will be the most highly owned golfers this week, and not without good reason. Consider fading them for the cheaper Rickie Fowler, who has been on a tepid march lately with a win and a trio of top-20 finishes in his last four starts. He's never missed the cut in Houston and has a pair of top-10 finishes.
8724	8724	19	20	target: (Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens are smaller than average and sectioned into quadrants. Don't discount the fact that the last two winners here (Jason Day and Zach Johnson) are among the tour's best putters. In addition to the aforementioned dexterity with the flatstick, aptitude with the driver (distance preferred!)
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
8577	8577	7	8	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Why not make it back to back? Paul Casey – $9,000  Even though he doesn’t win, Paul Casey loves to get out of the gates hot and wind up inside the top 15 in some way. It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
5781	5781	41	42	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've already used all four so its time to think outside the box. If we open up the criteria to top 20 in both tournament history AND long-term baseline performance we add the following names: Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott, Justin Rose, Jim Furyk, and Charl Schwartzel. I narrowed down to Rose or McIlroy at the Masters and picked wrong there.
3274	3274	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At less than $7,000, this is a no-brainer. Michael Kim - $6,400 (Field, 7-2)    Kim hit a rough patch of consecutive missed cuts at Riviera and the Honda, but he's cashed twice since, including a T17 in his last start at Bay Hill. That was his fifth top-25 already this season.
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
11365	11365	37	37	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5 couldn’t get much going here last year when shooting 70-72-71-71 to finish T38 but expect a real improvement on that. Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
1309	1309	0	1	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama  Price: $11,000  I wrote last week that I was going to continue to roll with Matsuyama until he cools off, and that's not changing now. Dating back to last fall, here's how the scintillating-hot 24-year-old has fared in his last six events: win, second place to Justin Thomas, win, win, win, second place to Justin Thomas. At some point he's going to finish outside of the Top 2, and there's a good chance that happens at Waialae, where he has three missed cuts (all as an amateur) and a DNF (2015), but he's just playing too well to fade right now.
5512	5512	25	26	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1.
540	540	4	4	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
10729	10729	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
6275	6275	19	19	target: Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s desperate for a win to secure his spot on the President’s Cup team this Fall. Pivot Plays  David Lingmerth ($8,500) – I like that DK priced Lingmerth this highly because he was bound to be extreme chalk otherwise. I still love him this week, and now we should get him under 15% owned.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
7690	7690	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
9270	9270	14	15	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan a couple of weeks ago with 20-under. Brooks Koepka loves a low one and he jumps off the page here. With a win (Japan) and a second (WGC-HSBC in China) in his last two starts, he's in cruise control mode and, although his price has been nibbled at, I'm happy to take 9/1.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2769	2769	19	20	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook. Graham DeLaet and Kevin Na. Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook.
785	785	18	18	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Ian Wilkerson - Wells Fargo - 2ew Simpson 40-1, Rahm 12-1; 1.5ew Casey 22-1; 1ew Swafford 66-1, JT Poston 110-1
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
6513	6513	45	46	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s going to be plenty of bogeys this week, so we need birdies to offset the damages. The top-10 in this field in recent birdie or better percentage are Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson, Tony Finau, Stewart Cink, Kevin Streelman, Grayson Murray, Boo Weekley, James Hahn, Patrick Reed, and Xander Schauffele. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Patrick Reed ($11,200)  This guy is going to win, and he’s going to win soon.
355	355	15	15	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get to say it on the pod, but don't sleep on PXG Perez or Molinari this week. Sign me up for both!
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
10436	10436	23	24	target: Harris English, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price. Harris English, $8500 – About halfway down the salary list we see English, and no, this is not a misinterpretation. But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
2623	2623	1	1	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
5094	5094	31	32	target: Jason Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After his recent missed cut (one of the few he’s had all year) I suspect he will fall off of most peoples radars. Another golfer in a very similar situation is Jason Dufner, who is well publicized to have worked heavily on his putting game all off season and it seems to be showing. It seems with his added putting skill the regular 45th place finishes of 2016 are starting to become top 25 finishes with some real upside mixed into the fold.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
7537	7537	32	32	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.

Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
3580	3580	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks seventh on the tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and putts per round. His spot in a pool with Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia will help temper ownership despite his play. O'Hair has made the cut four out of six tries at August National and in seven of his past nine tour events.
13055	13055	37	38	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another. I can definitely see Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson being part of the picture too so will back both for top 10s at [2.88] and [2.84] respectively. Both can play this course in their sleep and I want to cash in on their combination of experience and impressive recent form.
669	669	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott has been one of the hottest golfers in the world over the past month. It’s been several months since this Aussie last notched a podium finish on the PGA Tour, but we can’t be too disappointed with three consecutive fourths to open the FedEx Cup playoffs. Needless to say, Scott will bring plenty of momentum into this week, which should give him a fighting chance against the Days and Spieths of the world.
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
8186	8186	13	13	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We estimate his ownership to fall between 26 – 30%. Value Plays:  Adam Scott $8,600 – Scott is another guy who performed well last week with three rounds in the 60’s, and has always been a premier ball striker. He ranks high in this field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his Vegas odds to win are better or the same as Stenson, Garcia, Thomas, and Kuchar.
7027	7027	13	13	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. (2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III.
275	275	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Genesis Open Bets: Outright: DJ Scott E/W: Casey Grace Pieters English Long Shot: Donald FRL: List
11363	11363	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
12200	12200	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
10129	10129	10	10	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So why not use the CareerBuilder as a tune-up? Beyond Rahm, Brian Harman, on the heel of his recent HOT FIYA run, is the only other member of the world’s top 20 in the CareerBuilder field. Failing to convert another 36-hole lead at the Sony Open, the 3-foot-7 Harman is one of 10 players teeing it up for the third consecutive week to begin the year.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
1478	1478	22	23	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$10million+ Salary Players :  Positive: We have 6 players over the $10 million threshold this week which is something new for 2017. Bill Haas takes some beating from a consistency level - he's Mr PGA West - and although the move to a tricky Pete Dye Stadium Course has not helped the Carolinian in any sense, you would be crazy to leave him out of your roster if you want a +$10m spear-head. Zach Johnson is the other that appeals to me on the basis he made 21 birdies and an eagle last week, in what was far and away his best PGA Tour outing since the 2015 Barclays tournament.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
202	202	46	46	target: Koepka's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That should give the Californian the extra incentive to seal it in style and the other way of looking at it is that he may just feel a little more relaxed than some of the others who are the wrong side of the line and chasing. Koepka's recent putting stats are impressive (he's 10th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season) and when you put everything together he's capable of landing the title on his course debut. There are plenty of others who could play a part in what looks a fascinating week but, at the prices, I like my trio of Reed (50/1), Watson (40/1) and Koepka (30/1).
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
5462	5462	4	5	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Piercy ($8,500)  9. Phil Mickelson ($10,200)  11. Francesco Molinari ($10,500)  Recommended Lineup  Francesco Molinari: $10,500  Molinari finished second at the BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour in his most recent action.
7462	7462	13	13	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good min-price punt this week. Others: Robert Garrigus  High-upside GPP Picks  Bubba Watson ($9,400): Watson has picked up the pace a bit over his couple of starts and comes in off the back of three straight made cuts and a T27 at last weeks Open. It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well.
10743	10743	20	20	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure. (Note: It is worth following how Day says his back is feeling prior to Thursday.)
11766	11766	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style. Matt Kuchar – Cash – DK: $8200 FD: $10600  Although last weekend was rough for Matt Kuchar, I have full confidence to go back to him in cash game contests this week.
3325	3325	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a different golfer this year and just looks so confident out there. If you have followed us the past month you can probably tell that we have loved Rickie Fowler this year. And it has paid significant dividends.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
1350	1350	2	3	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Patrick Reed is a great bet at 60/1. Course History and extreme recent form being overvalued by the books.… https://t.co/TbrLwKNofc
2201	2201	20	20	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s close, and Riviera has been kind to him – top-4 finishes five times since T-10 in 2009. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
4103	4103	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A win in Fiji on the PGA Tour of Australasia two years ago slightly saves face, but there are obvious concerns at $11,500 and I am tempted to fade him this week. Brooks Koepka ($10,900) – Brooks Koepka at $10,900, are you crazy? Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best.
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
8017	8017	36	36	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
4230	4230	1	2	target: B. Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. B. Haas – Should be playing better than he is. Look for a top 5 here.
2032	2032	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
13568	13568	19	20	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As of midday Wednesday, he's way out front in ownership percentage at 20 percent. That's eight clicks better than Luke List in second and 14 points clear of both Sergio Garcia and Brendan Steele. Surely, there are options.
568	568	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
7685	7685	23	24	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is the defending champion. Pinterest Chris Condon  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Dustin Johnson  Jason Day  Rory McIlroy  Hideki Matsuyama  Brooks Koepka  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Bubba Watson  Professor's Explanation: Firestone is a big track. It is a "bombers and gorgers" kind of place.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
6636	6636	21	22	target: Curtis Luck 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the defending champion of the Greenbrier Classic - why should you keep an eye on him this weekend? And finally, Curtis Luck might be just a rookie - but why might he surprise the field in Virginia? Tune in to find you that and more!
3338	3338	32	32	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His averages are hurt by last year’s 75.5-point DraftKings performance in which he yielded an ugly -4.92 Plus/Minus. Spieth: Masters Report  Per our Trends tool, in the two years prior to 2016 McIlroy averaged 89.25 PPT and a +4.87 Plus/Minus with 100 percent Consistency. He was a beast in 2015, racking up 105.5 points and a +7.64 Plus/Minus.
9148	9148	15	16	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’re comfortable enough with Nick in GPPs or cash game contests. Best bargain basement option:  Aaron Wise $6,900 – We love Wise this week in GPP contests as we anticipate his ownership around 5%. Wise trains at TPC Summerlin and calls it a home track.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
11498	11498	22	23	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The world’s top-ranked players will congregate in a small 65-player field packed with talent to duke it out over four guaranteed rounds. Dustin Johnson, now established as World No. 1 for over a year, will look to win three of the last four iterations of this event dating back to the 2015 edition played at Doral.
41	41	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#TheBarclays Long Shot Bets: Vegas 150/1, Stefani 250/1, Glover 150/1.
8851	8851	33	34	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Matt Kuchar being priced at $7,700 on Draftkings he will make a great cash-game play or just throw him in as a core player in your GPP lineups, you won't regret it. Paul Casey @ $8,600  I don't think that there's a whole lot that I need to say about Paul Casey. He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
412	412	19	19	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Related: 2016 European Ryder Cup team  This week it’s the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston in Massachusetts. Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done.
3649	3649	53	53	target: Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It worries me slightly here with so much around-the-green work to be done, but if he continues to lap the field in SG: Approach and Putting, he’ll make enough birdies to counteract the hiccups. Oh, he’s the highest ranked player in the field too (16th), don’t forget that… I’m such a sucker for Dufner. He’s never been a great Pete Dye player, but his game theoretically translates perfectly.
13668	13668	33	34	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
4411	4411	1	1	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler took the title in 2015 and although his course record is feast or famine he can scarcely have arrived in better form. Fowler currently leads the tour in adjusting scoring average and it’s difficult to find any chinks in his armour. He missed the cut in New Orleans but that was a team format, when it comes to stroke play his record in 2017 is MC-4-1-16-12-3-11.
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
4099	4099	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
11373	11373	35	35	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It was interesting listening to Phil Mickelson in interview last year here where he talked at length about the nuances of altitude golf and how it can favour 'feel golfers' such as himself and with Bubba cut from a similar cloth in that respect, I can see him enjoying this week after finishing 38th on debut 12 months ago when at a very low ebb. Classical courses carry no concerns for Watson who's twice mastered Augusta National - and who's to say he won't contend again this year - and those tracks featuring Kikuyu on the fairways and rough and Poa Annua on the greens are clearly no issue, as was once again demonstrated at the Genesis on his last start. Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view.
463	463	2	2	target: Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thoughts on Brehm at $5900 on DK? 9th in DD / 33rd in BirdieAvg on @WebDotComTour last year. Slow greens neutralize poor putting... #DFS
6759	6759	9	10	target: Zach Johnson). 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steve Stricker from the Cheesehead state and Iowa native Zach Johnson). Take a look at the previous winners below:  2009 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2011 – Steve Stricker (Yes Back to Back to Back)  2012 – Zach Johnson  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2015- Jordan Spieth  2016 – Ryan Moore  You can start to notice a trend with the players that have won here, they are great putters on the green. TPC Deere Run is a Par 71 playing at 7,268 yards.
2122	2122	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
13267	13267	24	25	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Editor’s Note: Adam Hadwin has withdrawn from this week’s RBC Heritage Open. Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Marc Leishman, Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Kuchar, Brian Harman, Kevin Kisner, Charley Hoffman, Xander Schauffele, Francesco Molinari, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ian Poulter, Cameron Smith, Webb Simpson, Adam Hadwin, Si-WOOOO Kim, Satoshi Kodaira, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Martin Kaymer, Vijay Singh and Bryson Dechambeau are all in the 2018 Heritage field, and each one played the weekend in Augusta. Patrick Cantlay, Jason Dufner, Kevin Chappell, Ross Fisher, Dylan Frittelli, Charl Schwartzel, Ted Potter Jr., Billy Horschel, Doc Redman, Austin Cook and defending champion Wes Bryan all had aspirations of donning the Green Jacket, but that dream ended on Friday for them.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
1665	1665	23	25	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hard to ignore the combo. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Brandt Snedeker - $9,500 Jimmy Walker - $9,400 Jon Rahm - $9,200 Charles Howell III - $7,300 Aaron Baddeley - $6,900 Scott Stallings - $6,800  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
2026	2026	48	48	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But seriously, he hasn’t missed three cuts in a row since 2013, his play earlier in this season has still been solid, and his history in this tournament is just as sensational as the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open. So while others hopefully zag away from Walker, I will keep zigging and just address the elephant in the room later if he burns me again. Middle of the Road  Phil Mickelson $9,300 – Here’s a fun thing: apparently mild hernias are not that hard to recover from.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
2611	2611	47	48	target: Jason Dufner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
8939	8939	38	39	target: Gary Woodland. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's joined by the Tour Championship winner Xander Schauffele and runner-up here 12 months ago Hideki Matsuyama. This week's field also includes Tour Championship qualifiers Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Adam Hadwin, Pat Perez, Kyle Stanley, Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland. Throw-in talented players of the ilk of course winner Anirban Lahiri, Branden Grace, Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel and Thomas Pieters.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
12398	12398	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're chasing and have no qualms about sending anyone out, zone in on the last four champions – Day (2014, 2016), McIlroy (2015) and Dustin Johnson (2017). Day and DJ could square off in the quarterfinals, but you already knew that. Bring it on.
4014	4014	20	21	target: Charley Hoffman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plug him in and don’t check your lineups until Friday night to avoid any mid-round tilt. Also Consider: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Ollie Schneiderjans  Dark Horse  Luke List ($7,600) – Oh man, you aren’t writing up List again are you? He burned some beautiful lineups last weekend.
11932	11932	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
3392	3392	35	36	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even if you do hole them you have to hole them comfortably because if you’re grinding over every three-footer it becomes a burden. Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
9538	9538	45	46	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
2575	2575	22	22	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
11932	11932	1	1	target: Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
7570	7570	18	18	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
13216	13216	37	37	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Full team course history with this play because he has not been playing well at all. Betting Card  Outrights:  Hadwin 33/1 WD  Grillo 40/1  Kisner 45/1  List 55/1  Molinari 60/1 + E/W  Si Woo 100/1 + T10  Cook 100/1 + T10  T10 – Donald 10/1  It’s grown more than I intended but they are pretty light bets on the bottom 5 guys, with the emphasis at the top. Be sure to follow me on twitter (@FantasyJesusDFS) if you don’t already.

11467	11467	36	36	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why it is so hard to bypass Justin Thomas, who actually was leading the tournament after three rounds a year ago, a shot ahead of Johnson, but faded to a 1-over 72. Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
8440	8440	47	48	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some stats below from the opening round of the Playoffs over the past few years:  P ath to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Patrick Reed: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 2nd. 2015 - Jason Day: Round 1: 18th, Round 2: 8th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Hunter Mahan: Round 1: 2nd, Round 2: 12th, Round 3: 3rd.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
11510	11510	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The price reduction is also extremely attractive as you don’t normally see Jordan as the 4th highest player which will allow us to budget for several guys in the 7K and 8K range to complete our lineups. Value Plays:  Paul Casey $8,400 – The case for Paul Casey is fairly simple as he is easily the most glaring error in pricing that jumps out at us. He is a box-checking machine this week as far as Strokes Gained: Approach, Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, and Strokes Gained: Off the Tee.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
11206	11206	42	42	target: Anirban 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
2320	2320	40	41	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t expect much different this week either. Beyond Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas, all the top ranked players in the field are internationals: Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Branden Grace, Russell Knox, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Francesco Molinari, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald and Thomas Pieters. We even get a quartet of Brits making the trek to America for the first time this year: Danny Willet, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ty Hatton and Ian Poulter.
2471	2471	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking. Garcia was excellent off-the-tee last week, but struggled mightily on the greens. He should be in for some positive regression this week.
6889	6889	8	8	target: Stricker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since this event moved to Deere Run, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson, Kenny Perry and Jordan Spieth have won both tournaments and Tim Clark has come close to winning both, finishing runner-up in each event. Sean O'Hair, who won this tournament in 2005, finished tied for second in this year's Dean & Deluca alongside Deere Run specialist, Jordan Spieth, and the 2014 JDC winner, Brian Harman, finished tied for seventh alongside Stricker at this year's Dean & Deluca. Check out Valspar Championship form too as four men have won that tournament as well as this one - the aforementioned Spieth, John Senden, Sean O'Hair and Vijay Singh.
12175	12175	13	13	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he's converting on the greens, he has us at, "Cheers!" If both Woods and Rose are available to you, they might as well just line up as your picks for the API and the Masters in whichever quinella you prefer. We're treated to the steady contributions of Tommy Fleetwood and Alex Noren again this week, but they'll be there again for us at next week's Match Play where no one will want to square off against either.
1028	1028	7	7	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
2604	2604	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play. At $400 less than Matsuyama, who will likely be more widely owned, the globe-trotting Swede is the play at the new venue.
4887	4887	31	31	target: O'Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I kind of welcome that because I think it would benefit me more for sure." The forecast this week is such that it should separate the men from the boys and O'Hair certainly has the skills to thrive when the trouser legs are flapping. His past course form is patchy but he does have T16 and T18 to his name and T34 last year (ninth after round one) was okay too.
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
962	962	3	4	target: Si WOO 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RSMClassic Card 💰💰💰 Si WOO 66-1 Poston 75-1 Kang 100-1 Mitchell 150-1 Saunders 200-1 **Heavy On the T5 for Si Wo… https://t.co/rBUmrQ5leM
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12033	12033	28	29	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
992	992	0	2	target: B. De Jonge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			B. De Jonge is a sleeper pick this week as he should be low owned and have an outside chance to win the event. I have mentioned Tommy Gainey before, but he has let me down….. so I won’t say anything about him this week.
5434	5434	20	20	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell could easily fall between the cracks as he is competing with this week’s chalk, Kyle Stanley at $8,400. If Chappell hadn’t won a few weeks back at the Valero Texas Open, I honestly believe this would be the event we all would be saying was his to win. William McGirt – $7,300  Why is nobody talking about McGirt?!
7870	7870	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can. EXPERT ROB BOLTON , Fantasy Columnist LINEUP | BENCH Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth It’s all about rationing starts right now. So, with no cut at Firestone, there’s no urgency to burn one on Spieth.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
119	119	46	47	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tournament Skill Averages :  Driving Distance: 32nd, Driving Accuracy: 22nd, Greens in Regulation: 12th, Proximity to Hole: 20th, Scrambling: 30th, Putting Average 27th. So let's take a view from players as to how Bethpage Black played at the 2012 Barclays and what specific skills it requires:  Bubba Watson : "I think it'll be a tough test. Again, that's the only time I've played it, so I don't know if they can firm up the greens.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
12789	12789	33	34	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five of the world's top 10 have already won in 2018, with Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy picking up victories as recently as the Florida Swing. Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
7110	7110	12	12	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m thinking the odds are in his favor. Sergio Garcia… Much like Fowler, he’s elite when it comes to playing in the elements. It’s no wonder he’s pieced together 10 top 10s in 20 Open Championship appearances.
1760	1760	46	46	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
10026	10026	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer. And I say that as a good thing.
565	565	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed Kaymer at 185/1. Poor record here, but playing well and likes the big event. Weather could produce a surprise winner like ZJ in 2007.
8940	8940	43	44	target: Gary Woodland; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) Jim Herman; 13) Paul Casey; 14) Graeme DeLaet / Richy Werenski; 16) Hao Tong Li / Brendan Steele; 18) Jason Dufner / Lucas Glover; 20) Rafael Cabrera-Bello.

11427	11427	28	28	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s due for a breakout on the North American stage, and perhaps a trip to Mexico is all he needs to get the monkey off his back. Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil.
5941	5941	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect a thrilling finish and bounce backs from McIlroy and Day, who both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Russell Knox  2015 – Bubba Watson  2014 – Kevin Streelman  2013 – Ken Duke  2012 – Marc Leishman  2011 – Fredrik Jacobsen  2010 – Bubba Watson  2009 – Kenny Perry  2008 – Stewart Cink  2007 – Hunter Mahan    Key Stats to Winning at TPC River Highlands    • Par Breakers percentage  • Par 4 scoring average  • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green    Champion's Profile    With an interesting list of both short and long hitters claiming victories in the past, it is clear length has little to do with winning on one of the PGA Tour’s shortest courses. Plenty of shorter holes means birdies can come in bunches and are essential to success here, so look for players with high par-breaker percentages as quality candidates.
7176	7176	30	30	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.

Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.
10025	10025	2	2	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.

Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.

He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).

7416	7416	38	38	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey. RESULT: T62  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  We were on board Ollie Schniederjans as recently as Old White TPC and despite a very strange WD there for a scoring card signing infringement, I'm still very much of the opinion that Ollie is a player to watch right now. His last performance at the John Deere Classic was far better as he co-led after shooting a flawless -8/63 on Thursday and backed that up with a -5/66 to get back in contention.

6589	6589	21	21	target: List. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tight with tough to hit greens and penalizing areas around the green. That is not the ideal course set up for List. However, Old White TPC course is.
6003	6003	1	2	target: David Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. David Lingmerth, $7,900  After a poor start to the season, Lingmerth has found the form that made the 29-year-old one of the game’s most interesting prospects in 2015-16. The Swede has four top-21 finishes in his last five events, smashing salary-based expectation each time.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
11212	11212	4	5	target: 1.Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top-5 finishers last year:  1.Rickie Fowler  T2.

Rickie Fowler (DraftKings $11,700, FanDuel $12,300: Rickie will look to earn his ticket back to the Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the same way he did last year, by winning the Honda Classic.
4863	4863	47	48	target: Jason Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Amazingly Jon Rahm heads the betting, which is a measure of his meteoric rise along with the lack of strength in depth in the field. The Spaniard is a class act but I think the title might be heading to another elite ball-striker in the shape of Jason Dufner. Twice a runner-up at Colonial he finished T6 last year and it’s clearly a course he gets on well with.
5594	5594	21	22	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
8178	8178	21	21	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can keep it going on the greens, he very well could win a second week in a row. Like Fowler, Matsuyama has never won a major, but he doesn't carry nearly the baggage that Fowler does. Tier 2 Values    Matt Kuchar - $8,800 (50-1)    While we picked four of the top-5 guys on the DraftKings board in Tier 1, we're dropping way down in price for Tier 2, bypassing the low-$10,000 and all the $9,000 guys, including Brooks Koepka.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here.

5837	5837	8	9	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s break down the field! The Favorites…  Rickie Fowler – Player with the most balanced bag in the field goes right back to the top after missing the cut in Memphis. Fowler checks in #2 SG: Total highlighted by his excellent putting and short game.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
4150	4150	21	22	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
12194	12194	8	9	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite. We all know how that ended, Thomas edging out Luke List in a play-off, and for me it was an outcome which underlined why you have to think very carefully before taking ultra-skinny prices as Fowler failed to so much as make the weekend.
1628	1628	30	30	target: Snedeker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one shot adrift when play resumed on the Monday, but winds from the opposite direction meant Jimmy Walker, Kevin Streelman and most notably KJ Choi failed to better Snedeker. Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
330	330	6	6	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
13091	13091	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t putt. The last time Scott gained strokes on the green was at the WGC Bridgestone last July. Not great, Bob.
5319	5319	11	12	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The less our players have to scramble the better. Core Plays  Rickie Fowler ($12,000) – Never thought I would see the day that I pay $12,000 for Rickie Fowler. That is the kind of year this guy is having though.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
3679	3679	27	27	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
11205	11205	30	30	target: Garcia's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago. The week before, he won the Singapore Open.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
417	417	42	43	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			South America: Emiliano Grillo – The Argentine is on a lovely run of form as he looks set to clinch the Rookie of the Year award on the PGA Tour. He finished in a tie for second last week, just one behind Patrick Reed, and also tied for 13th and 8th at the USPGA and Olympics. He’s up to sixth in the FedEx Cup and up to a career-high 25th in the world.
7177	7177	7	7	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
9312	9312	60	61	target: Dustin Johnson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			doesn’t have a huge correlation at this course, but it does have a strong correlation to making birdies. The Golfers  Justin Thomas ($11100): This may be a good spot to get the reigning champion at lower-than-expected ownership (relative to the size of the field), with JT priced at the top of the field ahead of past winners Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson; Thomas won last year as he went nuclear to kick off his 2017, and he should be able to keep that up this week. Thomas was the best golfer from 50-125 yards out last year (15’6” from the cup on average) and was the sixth-best golfer in SG: Approach.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
13195	13195	0	1	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
194	194	2	2	target: @BHaasGolf 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @BHaasGolf at 22/1 in the #careerbuilderchallenge. Hard to knock the strong claims of the two-time tournament winner Haas
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
6390	6390	8	9	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Greenbrier  1. Patrick Reed  2. Bill Haas  3.
236	236	19	19	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He loves the challenge of a difficult golf course and I could easily see him taking home this title. Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 33/1  Draftkings - $9,100  FantasyAces - $5,650  Bubba checks every box for me this week. He is coming off an 8th place finish at the Olympics and if there was anyone who seemed to embrace the experience 100% it was definitely Bubba.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
13639	13639	32	33	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Henrik Stenson, Zach Johnson, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
1006	1006	5	6	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whee Kim - $7,400  5. Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
2495	2495	38	38	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In other words, right now he has the game to play well anywhere and that makes him such an appealing proposition on a course unknown to virtually everyone this week. Speaking about the current state of his game, Woodland said at the end of the Honda Classic: "I'm happy with the way I'm playing, and looking forward to playing the next couple weeks in a row." That's here and next week's PGA Tour event at Innisbrook.
13112	13112	40	41	target: Si Woo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time. The thing that makes these two finishes of particular interest to me is that when Si Woo has won his two PGA tour titles to date he hasn’t come in to the events on a blinding run of form, but has actually won events following steady 25th & 22nd place finishes. So in summary we have a world class proven winner, on a perfect track for his game rounding in to steady form.
732	732	3	3	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			OAD will be Grace or Steele im still undecided
168	168	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To steal a line from Samuel L. Jackson in the first Jurassic Park, "Hold on to your butts." Jonathan Coachman -- Jason Day ($12,400)  Bethpage Black is a "big boys" golf course. There are a lot of holes that have long carries and long approach shots.
7624	7624	54	55	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This isn’t incredibly groundbreaking information, but you’ll want to roster golfers who can take advantage of the short Par 5s and who are in good recent form in terms of accuracy. The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively.
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods – $10,000  Personal note – I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.

3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
9725	9725	3	3	target: Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
11154	11154	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton 25/1  The Englishman has been in super form recently and hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in his last six starts. Since winning the Alfred Dunhill Links and Italian Open back to back in October, Hatton followed that with an impressive T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China. He then travelled to Turkey finishing T16 at the Turkish Airlines Open followed by a T19 at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa.
12672	12672	28	29	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
3599	3599	28	29	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
2433	2433	11	12	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 on Tour in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season truly dangerous. Sergio Garcia ($10,900) – What’s not to like about this choice? He’s been playing well recently (a win in Dubai three weeks ago featured four rounds in the 60s).
1921	1921	27	28	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry $7,000 – Very low price, Oostyesque if you know what I’m saying. C-List  Cameron Smith $6,900  Jim Herman $6,900  Ryan Brehm $6,700  Steve Stricker $6,600  Robert Garrigus $6,600  That is all for this week. Per the usual hit me up on twitter if you have questions or need help.
9633	9633	38	39	target: Kevin Kisner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Those who've shown if not here then at places like Harbour Town, Southwind, Colonial and Copperhead, that a low-scoring test of precision is their bag; that hard-to-hit fairways offer an opportunity, rather than a problem. Someone, perhaps, like Kevin Kisner. With the front two in the betting there to be taken on, suddenly this feels like an eminently winnable event.
6178	6178	34	35	target: Rory McIlroy: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ultimately, we're looking at another second-shot golf course this week with greens in regulation percentage, proximity to the hole, and iron play from 150 to 200 yards key this week. Creme de la Creme  Rory McIlroy: $11,600  If Rory McIlroy doesn't barnstorm his way around this course and make one million birdies, he's not Rory McIlroy. Seriously.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
4634	4634	106	107	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8200	8200	23	23	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He then travelled to Birkdale and didn’t shoot worse than a 71 to finish a respectable T22. Last week at the WGC Bridgestone, Fowler was steady as a rock throughout the week shooting 70,71,67,66 on his way to a solo ninth. He has a good record here in Quail Hollow getting his first PGA Tour win here in 2012.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
13683	13683	0	1	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
11226	11226	62	63	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Bob Harig  Daniel Berger  Neither form nor recent course history seems like it's on his side -- he MC'd in last week's Genesis Open and each of the last two editions of the Honda -- but he's played well so far this year and is back on home turf at an event where he once reached a playoff. -- Jason Sobel  Luke Donald  Donald has his spots on the PGA Tour, and this is one of them. The fact that he was able to make the cut last week and not finish last on a course that rewards strong off the tee play is a good thing.
1815	1815	4	5	target: Hideki Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
1413	1413	22	22	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sub $8million Salary Players :  Positive: Ryan Blaum and Charles Howell III deserve respect as highlighted and I cannot believe that Chris Kirk is available at ($7.7m). Kirk was top-priced $11.3m at the RSM Classic last time out for him and a missed cut there has seen his salary plummet by $3.6 million. That's a huge downshift and one that needs to exploited as Kirk is a TifDwarf Bermudagrass green specialist who otherwise finished 2016 brilliantly.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
10975	10975	19	20	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am looking for Pieters to draw on his good memories here and put his good form to use. Keegan Bradley ($7.6K) – Keegan Bradley seems to be returning to his Major-winning ways this year. He spent most of last year getting sorted with putting grips and changes.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
459	459	30	31	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tuesday, August 30, 2016  From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk .
669	669	4	5	target: L. List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: L. List - 60/1 J. Spaun - 66/1 N. Taylor - 150/1 M. Jones - 175/1 S. Power - 200/1 Top 20s to follow. Weak field!
11031	11031	40	41	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s always a danger he’ll hit a wall like Brian Harman and Chez Reavie have before him, but he’s simply playing too well to be overlooked, especially when you’re getting a discount because of the bigger names in the field. Martin Kaymer  The former world’s No. 1 has been middling with results for about two years now.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
5436	5436	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
5887	5887	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			275 yards (46th), 85.7% fairways (9th), 72.2% greens in regulation (34th), proximity to hole 32'0" (45th), 95.0% scrambling (1st), 1.67 putts per GIR (11th). 2010, Bubba Watson (-14). 321 yards (1st), 66.1% fairways (58th), 70.8% greens in regulation (38th), proximity to hole 31'5" (25th), 57.1% scrambling (43rd), 1.63 putts per GIR (2nd).
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
8198	8198	57	58	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Quail Hollow Club, Charlotte, North Carolina  7,600 yards, Par 71  The Course  Quail Hollow is the host course of the Wells Fargo Championship since 2003 and is a tough test measuring a lengthy 7,600 yards. Previous winners here include Brian Harman (2017), James Hahn (2016), Rory McIlroy (2015 and 2010) J.B. Holmes (2014), Derek Ernst (2013), Rickie Fowler (2012) and Lucas Glover (2011). The course was originally designed by golf course architect George Cobb in 1961 to capture the beauty as well as challenging terrain of the Piedmont region.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
10595	10595	7	7	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Catch him while he’s on the rise. Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
4959	4959	52	53	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
5779	5779	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two spots remaining, we have $18,300 left to work with. Golfers that could fill the final two spots: Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Brooks Koepka, and Rickie Fowler. DraftKings Picks:    Jordan Spieth ($11,500): Using Spieth as my anchor because I like his ability to prep for a new course.

12656	12656	68	70	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Six of the world’s Top 20 will tee it up in Houston. Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson and Henrik Stenson are the class of the field, follow edclosely by the second tier of Tony Finau, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Berger, defending champ Russell Henley, Luke List, Chez Reavie, Keegan Bradley, Peter Uihlein, Jason Dufner, Brandt Snedeker, J.B. Holmes, Ben An, Thomas Pieters, Yuta Ikeda, Charles Howell III and Indian wunderkind Shubhankar Sharma.

13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.

5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
7689	7689	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
6455	6455	1	1	target: Randolph 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jonathan Randolph ($6900) – A better putter than his SG: Putting rank of 100 would suggest, Randolph is very good at one-putting (40.9%) and is nails from 4-8’ (7 th in 148 attempts) which isn’t listed as a “key” stat, but is encompassed in the 5-10’ putting range that has some importance. Randolph is great from short distances and like Vaughn is known for his accuracy. He missed the cut in 2015 (only attempt) but has shown better form in making seven of his last ten events, including a T8.
11494	11494	19	20	target: Thomas Pieters, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a somewhat risky option but is priced modestly given he won the last time he teed it up. Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week.
10396	10396	22	22	target: Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cherry Hills: Winner: Billy Horschel; EW Places: Watson, Hoffmann, Fowler, Palmer. TPC Summerlin: Winner: Ben Martin; EW Places: Streelman, Knox, Simpson, Finau, Piercy. 2015 :  Old White: Winner: Danny Lee; EW Places: Streb, Henley, Hahn.
10206	10206	63	63	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event. Even so, an $8,900 salary on FanDuel this week has a significant amount of value in it if Woods makes the cut and shows very capable top-25 upside. He won the event in 2013, but Woods is clearly a different golfer now in 2018.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
5379	5379	20	21	target: Graeme McDowell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s also got the same Vegas odds to win as defending champion, Daniel Berger, nearly $900 more expensive on DraftKings. Graeme McDowell $7,500 – GMac has missed one cut all year and plays Harbour Town in Hilton Head like he built it. We see Harbour Town as a related course to TPC Southwind.
5267	5267	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			24th in strokes gained: total. Charley Hoffman: $6,500  A definite head-scratcher priced this low, Charley Hoffman is 15th on Tour this season in strokes gained: off-the-tee and 29th in strokes gained: tee-to-green. In other words, another solid player here, folks.
9711	9711	24	24	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee. This play is all ownership dependent, currently, we are projecting Thomas at around 14% in GPP’s but that could all change throughout the week before we do a final update for VIP members. Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event.
8750	8750	4	24	target: Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7 Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas not firing at Conway Farms, I'm happy to take Spieth for a second week running. RESULT: T7  Justin Rose 2.5pts EW 16/1 with NEW! £100 in free bets for new customers, T&Cs apply (5 places, 1/5 odds):  It's not rocket science I know but if momentum, course experience and the ability to win big tournaments mean anything this week, I think Justin Rose is a decent bet in a world where both Jason Day and Jon Rahm are shorter prices.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
3766	3766	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
4553	4553	47	47	target: Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season. With that drama now behind him Poulter should be free to “swing freely” at this event, where he’s had some success in the past, including a runner-up finish from 2009. What I like most about Poulter here though is his recent form.
5627	5627	3	4	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’. Seeing Scott stand over a 4’ putt can be a scary thing (126th), but he’s leaving only 2’3” on approach putts and has hit a fair number of putts from a distance.
7934	7934	44	44	target: Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CAVEAT: putting is so variable week to week that it’s never good to rely on that, but with such a strong game in getting to the green, even if Rickie putts poorly this week he’ll still be in contention. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Thomas Pieters ($7500): Unfortunately this won’t be a week where Pieters gets overlooked at an excellent price like at Augusta or the Open, after his excellent performance at the WGC Bridgestone (sitting in first place at the time of writing) – as an aside, Firestone CC is a decent comparable course for Quail Hollow. Pieters still gets his feature in this space for the second week in a row thanks to his excellent iron play which will be so crucial this week, and his ability to absolutely smash the ball off the tee when needed.
3239	3239	48	48	target: Peterson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Total Points staked this week: 3  Profit/Loss for 2017: – 36  I have purposely kept stakes to a minimum this week, as I didn’t want to get too involved in this event. Horschel was too obvious to ignore, whilst I have been looking for a chance to back Peterson, and Texas is as arguably the best place to get him on side. Ross Fisher looked like giving us a run for our money last week, only to be knocked out by Hideto Tanihara in the quarter finals.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
532	532	20	20	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His switch back to a Scotty Cameron flat stick already seems to be paying dividends. Along with the improved putting, McIlroy ranks first on tour in both P5S and BoB, with ranks of fourth in PROX and 10th in DD. He has struggled with consistency this year but the small field allows owners to pay up for his tier-topping salary.
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can’t look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
6050	6050	49	49	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
1261	1261	12	12	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			LETS DO THIS!!!!! NORTH COURSE STACK!!!!! Spaun +8000 Cink +10000 Chesson +10000 Wise +12500 Mullinax +15000 Post… https://t.co/3EHQym9alE
1248	1248	13	13	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And his putting and especially scrambling leave something to be desired. But, like Watson, he's still done well at Kapalua. Jason Dufner - $7,400 (40-1)    Dufner's last visit to the TOC was in 2014, when he tied for fifth.
7537	7537	32	32	target: Hughes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hughes played the tournament once before, missing the cut four years ago. All that said, the weight of Canada will be on his shoulders, especially if he's in the mix on Sunday. Hughes is a premier putter, ranked eighth in strokes gained putting.
749	749	0	2	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Si Woo Kim showed showed some life at the Valero with a T22. If he's healthy, he and Kang could be a formidable duo at 70/1 in the Zurich.
1445	1445	4	4	target: @BrandtSnedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First #ATTProAm bet is @BrandtSnedeker at 49/1. Snedeker absolutely loves Pebble Beach and has two wins here since… https://t.co/vL4CebF7GI
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week. Yahoo!
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
10025	10025	2	2	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
3688	3688	48	49	target: Branden Grace, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Perhaps remembering the early days of golf betting and the advice of Keith Elliott, I've always tended to back players at Hilton Head who didn't put themselves in the heat of battle at Augusta the week before. And this week's defending champion, Branden Grace, fits the bill. Grace was a nearest-the-finish T27 at Augusta but, rather than view that as a slight disappointment, he was probably relatively pleased given that he'd previously missed his last three cuts at the Masters.
12883	12883	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
12469	12469	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course does grade out as a pretty strong fit so maybe, just maybe, he can break out of his massive slump. The Specialists  Retief Goosen  Emiliano Grillo  The specialist this week is Retief Goosen. The South African has flashed some form early in the year but no real consistency.
5822	5822	27	27	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That win was at Royal Aberdeen which I alluded to earlier. Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week.
3492	3492	2	2	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th). His putting will need to improve this week, but Augusta greens are a different challenge than anything the South African has faced this season and he knows exactly what to expect of them, after eight starts here.
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
5708	5708	20	21	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rosie’s price tag is too cheap, and he’s consistently overlooked in majors on DraftKings despite a great performance. Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,500 – “Kiz” joined us on the Tour Junkies Podcast this week after seeing Erin Hills and believes that it’s going to come down to keeping it in the fairway off the tee, chipping off these tight lies around the greens, and solid putting. Basically…that’s Kevin Kisner!
4589	4589	9	10	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Past Five Champions    2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Rickie Fowler  2014 – Martin Kaymer  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Matt Kuchar    Last Year’s Top 10 Finishers      1 Jason Day -15  2 Kevin Chappell -11  T3 Justin Thomas -10  T3 Matt Kuchar -10  T3 Colt Knost -10  T3 Ken Duke -10  T7 Francesco Molinari -9  T7 Hideki Matsuyama -9  T9 Graeme McDowell -8  T9 Daniel Berger -8  T9 Alex Cejka -8  The Names  Hey, Remember Me?

His rankings in SG:T2G (fourth) and scrambling (second) this season on Tour are elite, and it doesn’t hurt that he won this event in the past.Jason Day – $16,900Hideki Matsuyama – $16,900Justin Thomas – $16,500Henrik Stenson – $16,200The Pick: Everyone in this group could conceivably be listed in “The Names” category, as they all have notable victories and elite potential.
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
4303	4303	21	22	target: Bud Cauley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With those injury doubts, I'm willing to let him go there. The other player with a hat-trick of top 10s is Bud Cauley. Okay, they're of a different variety and one was even in a pairs event last week when he finished T5 alongside Justin Thomas in New Orleans.
8657	8657	30	43	target: Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Stewart Cink, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Lucas Glover, Brian Harman, Hideki Matsuyama, Jhonattan Vegas. 1 - Keegan Bradley, Bryson DeChambeau, Bill Haas, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Sean O'Hair, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter, Chez Reavie, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Kyle Stanley, Henrik Stenson, Justin Thomas. The BMW Championship, the third leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, has a number of trends that are intriguing.
1346	1346	5	5	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us. His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
4101	4101	23	24	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last eight starts, his WORST finish is T-13, and he has won here. And we give you Adam Hadwin (ballstriker) and Luke Donald, who only played here once, but was T-13 and showed some good form last week. Charley Hoffman, who is money at this event.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
5841	5841	15	16	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, he only has one top 10 in the last five years in this event. Adam Scott – Played the weekend in his last five including finishes of T-9, T-4 and T-18 last year at Oakmont. There aren’t many better in the GIR department, and that’s why the Aussie continues to collect big checks most weeks he tees it up.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
11925	11925	42	42	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However thrilling it was to see Tiger in contention, he didn't quite win and while I don't hold that against him, we are talking about a different player and a different sport now. When Woods took the title here in 2013, Rickie Fowler paid the price for trying to serve it up to him as a closing 73 dropped him to third, but I'm hopeful he can demonstrate that he's capable of going a couple of places better some five years on. Three weeks ago, Fowler was a single-figure price for a renewal of the Honda Classic which featured Justin Thomas, currently the most prolific player on the planet and one of the game's true elite.
3766	3766	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
3612	3612	35	36	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ross Fisher – $6,900  Ross Fisher was a late addition to The Masters field, so he will definitely be overlooked and less hyped up than other golfers. His pricing fell into a crowded range with Adam Hadwin and Kevin Kisner. Fisher is a lesser known player on the PGA Tour as he is a predominately a Euro Tour golfer, which will help suppress his ownership further.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
6210	6210	14	15	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are getting firmer and faster and the rough’s not getting any shorter." David Lingmerth : "I was really calm all day. You've really got to golf your ball out here.
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
1247	1247	0	1	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
3099	3099	15	16	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA Tour Fantasy Golf DraftKings Picks – The Puerto Rico Open  Lock of the week:  Luke List $9,900 – Luke is in solid form coming off his T17 at the API. He’s played this event twice without a missed cut, including a T15 last year. We’ve heard from sources on site that the rough is basically non existent.
1021	1021	24	25	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After tying for 66th in his Sea Island debut, has missed the cut in four consecutive starts. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
12241	12241	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
2533	2533	46	47	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price. Finally, I want to side with Kevin Na in some way and the top-five and top-10 markets look best. In essence, Na is another accurate type, with form at altitude and at some of the PGA Tour’s tighter courses, such as Harbour Town and Silverado.
13299	13299	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he is priced as the 11th– most expensive player on DK, DailyRoto gives Hatton the fourth-best win probability (2.66%). Putting and short game are going to be a huge factor this week and Hatton is fifth in SG Putting and fourth in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green. This is a steal at just $8,800.
7951	7951	145	146	target: Kyle Stanley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 PGA Championship Picks: Show Index  3:23 Course  7:46 Key Stats  9:09 Field/Odds Breakdown  37:25 Bets & Picks  39:08 One and Done  There’s $1,000,000 up for grabs at PGA Championship on DraftKings, so Sign Up for a DraftKings Account Today and get a FREE $10!!! 2017 PGA Championship Details  Purse: $10.25M  FedEx Cup Points: 600  Defending Champion: Jimmy Walker  Course: Quail Hollow  Yardage: 7,600  Par: 71  2017 PGA Championship Key Stats  Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee  Driving Distance  Par 4 Performance 450-500 Yards  Strokes Gained: Approach  Ball Striking  2017 PGA Championship Picks: One And Done  Team Mayo:$6,523,697  2017 PGA Championship Pick: Adam Scott  2017 Golfers Used: Jimmy Walker, Jamie Lovemark, Martin Laird, Jon Rahm, Sean O’Hair, Dustin Johnson, Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland, Henrik Stenson, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton, Branden Grace, Lucas Glover, Martin Kaymer, Patrick Reed, Nick Taylor, Rickie Fowler, Kyle Stanley, Shane Lowry, Brendan Steele, David Hearn, Harris English, Kelly Kraft, Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Daniel Berger  Team Stewart: $2,231,161  2017 PGA Championship Pick: Brooks Koepka  2017 Golfers Used: Pat Perez, Luke List, Gary Woodland, Harris English, JB Holmes, Paul Casey, Daniel Berger, Martin Kaymer, Wes Bryan, Francesco Molinari, Thomas Pieters, Charley Hoffman, Jordan Spieth, William McGirt, Brendan Steele, Jon Rahm, Ryan Moore, Tony Finau, Marc Leishman, Patrick Cantlay, Peter Uihlien, Branden Grace, Bubba Watson, Danny Lee, David Lingmerth, Curtis Luck, Andy Sullivan, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele  Mayo’s 2017 PGA Championship Picks: Value Bets  Outright Winner (2x Units)  Jon Rahm +2500  Outright Winner (Full Units)  Adam Scott +4000  Outright Winner (3/4 Units)  Daniel Berger +6600  Outright Winner (1/2 Units)  JB Holmes +9000  Tony Finau +10000  Louis Oosthuizen +11000  Kyle Stanley +15000  Outright Winner (1/4 Units; e/w)  Jamie Lovemark +20000  James Hahn +22500  Outright Winner (1/8 Units; e/w)  Bud Cauley +25000  Andrew Johnson +30000  First Round Leader (T5 Each Way)  Jimmy Walker +9000  Louis Oosthuizen +9000  Jamie Lovemark +11000  Byeong-Hun An +12500  Keegan Bradley +12500  James Hahn +12500  Patrick Rodgers +1500  Jason Kokrak +17500  Luke List +17500  Scott Brown +20000  Jonas Blixt +20000  Matt Dobyns +40000  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

7016	7016	42	43	target: Scott Brown, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round.
5212	5212	53	53	target: Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $10,000  The last time we saw Hideki, he finished T22 at The PLAYERS and it seems as though the buzz around Hideki has gone away. Obviously he isn’t the hottest golfer on the planet anymore like he was late in 2016, but he certainly shouldn’t be priced $1,000 less that Spieth. Matsuyama won this event in 2014 and game T5 in 2015 and we are all well aware of his capabilities tee to green.
778	778	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
6544	6544	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
11175	11175	26	26	target: Hatton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After winning the Masters last year, Sergio appears to be a much more relaxed player who is more likely to raise a trophy come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton, $10600 – A European Tour staple, Hatton will make his first PGA Tour start this season at the course he finished fourth at last year. Hatton is a great putter who recently finished third at the Dubai Desert Classic, making him worth strong consideration this week.
3769	3769	13	14	target: Chad Campbell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Please! Make the cut  Luke List $7,300  Lucas Glover $7,200  Kyle Stanley $7,200  Chad Campbell $7,100  I really don’t think you must dip below $7,000 this week, but of course you can if you choose. I probably won’t.
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
11475	11475	26	27	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
4208	4208	26	27	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s the inaugural version of this event, so not much to talk about in the way of past winners. The Golfers  The Core  Daniel Berger – Thomas Pieters (14 to 1 currently): With the ability shown by Thomas Pieters in the Ryder Cup, it’s clear that the Belgian can succeed in the team format (even in a losing effort). Coming off a top-5 at the Masters, Pieters has the distance (technically 64th on Tour, but hasn’t played any full-on bombers courses) and the putting to cash in with his partner.
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
1477	1477	13	13	target: Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut. 12 months on from a switch to PXG, Zach has established what seems a comfortable relationship with his clubs, and the putter really clicked at Waialae last week.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
2601	2601	2	2	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
2599	2599	15	15	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like Mickelson, he's a lot of golfer for $7,500. And averaging 3.75 birdies per round, Kaymer can fill it up. Definitely the biggest upside of anyone in the $7,400-$7,500 range.
185	185	245	245	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fansharesports.com Listener League: https://t.co… Free View in iTunes  71 Explicit WGC HSBC Championship Podcast | Kenny's New Sound w/ Special Guest @DFSJimmie Listener League: https://t.co/eXAucbEn3g Fanshare… Free View in iTunes  72 Explicit The CIMB Classic | Kenny Doesn't Listen to Brad...again Make sure to check out www.fansharesports.com wer… Free View in iTunes  73 Explicit Safeway Open Breakdown | PGA Tour is back!

5686	5686	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Dufner 2 weeks ago and Bello last week recency bias is real and he could be that guy this week after his missed cut at the St. Jude, which I’m not worried about at all. Middle Range  Paul Casey $8,400 – He currently sits as the second highest rated golfer in my model. Knock on wood he hasn’t missed a cut since I mushed him with my One and Done pick in Hawaii.
5107	5107	11	11	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I really thought I could have got to that magic number." Scott looks a danger on any suitable course right now and this must count as one of them. Take the 25s.
12079	12079	46	46	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of the field will shy away from challenging the water, however, and that leads to a lot of long irons. Over 33 percent of approach shots come from beyond 200 yards, so it’s no surprise that players such as Tiger, Stenson, Rose, Keegan, Rory and Scott all have experienced success at this event over the years. Quality long irons will help mitigate the difficulty of the long Par 3s (three over 200 yards), the lengthier Par 4s (six over 450 yards), make the Par 5s slightly easier, and potentially open up an eagle opportunity on the 16th hole.
1060	1060	34	41	target: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign: First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2) Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33) Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18) Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25) Jim Furyk (T11-3) Robert Streb (WIN-T25) Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9) Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  Each week I think aloud to provide you with my One-and-Done selection as well as a few alternatives. Fade or Follow?
10569	10569	14	15	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he’s playing well again and was T-12 at Farmers last week. Also like: Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
7246	7246	22	23	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I prefer him at 25/1 than out-of-form Rory McIlroy and inexperienced Jon Rahm at 18s. Justin Rose and massively in-form local hero Tommy Fleetwood both have obvious links to Royal Birkdale and should go well at 25/1 and 18s respectively. A bit further down, I like Adam Scott and Branden Grace too.
7087	7087	54	55	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps it’s a big the reason why Royal Birkdale has produced so many classy winners. By country it reads five Americans - Arnold Palmer (1961), Lee Trevino (1971), Johnny Miller (1976), Tom Watson (1983) and Mark O'Meara (1998), three Australians - Peter Thomson (1954 & 1965) and Ian Baker-Finch (1991) and one Irishman - Padraig Harrington (2008). Every winner since the world rankings became a thing was a top 25 player; every winner before they existed would probably have been in the top 10.
3223	3223	54	55	target: Phil Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, the Rees Jones design is a par 72 that measures 7,441 yards, which will provide a stern test to all of those teeing it up this week. There are a number of big names in the field this week working on eleventh hour tune-ups for Augusta, including Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Phil Mickelson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Adam Scott and many others. I took last week off from my column (#sorrynotsorry Puerto Rico Open and WGC Match Play), but two weeks ago my picks at the Arnold Palmer Invitational were straight nails as my Driver-off-the-Deck BOLD play of the week on Marc Leishman took home the trophy.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
11974	11974	16	17	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I do not hate the idea of a Day-Noren playoff for the second time this year. Henrik Stenson ($9100) – People will most likely be off of him due to his poor performance last week. It hopefully will not take much to be overweight on Stenson and he has great history (minus last year).
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6207	6207	56	75	target: David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Boo Weekley; 3) Ben Crane; 3) Spencer Levin; 4) Tim Wilkinson; 5) Kyle Stanley; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Jim Herman / Daniel Summerhays; 9) David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Johnson Wagner; 18) Martin Laird / Kyle Reifers; 20) K.J. Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor.
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
13126	13126	8	9	target: Matt Every, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - K.J. Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Fabian Gomez, Billy Horschel, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Davis Love III, Ryan Palmer, Brandt Snedeker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Graeme McDowell, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, John Senden, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Nick Watney.
8228	8228	19	19	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts. We currently have Rory projected for 21-25 percent ownership in large-field guaranteed prize pools (GPPs), but I wouldn’t be shocked to see him break 30 percent in DraftKing’s Millionaire Maker.
2475	2475	22	22	target: Diaz 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dufner-8100 way too much when Noren’s 7200  Molinari-8200 same reason as above. Names to know, or I had to look up-  Roberto Diaz ($6,500)- Playing his way via the highest ranked Mexican golfer in the world, Diaz has been tearing up the Web.Com tour this year posting a 4/4 record with 3 top 20’s. In a no cut event for the min price playing for the pride of his country, I like the narrative here.
13249	13249	29	29	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson is one of the most talented souls on tour; just not sure that translates to dividends this week. We do like Riccio's picks of Paul Casey and Zach Johnson, two players whose games mirror past RBC Heritage winners like Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, and Graeme McDowell. Same goes for his picks of Austin Cook (although the Model seemingly chooses Cook every week) and Matt Kuchar (who's won here in the past).
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
3396	3396	44	45	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes, he’s on a streak, but he wouldn’t be my choice down to the fade. He is big and strong, which is a help, but even coming off the win, and I think he’s in a happy place, no I’d definitely be sticking with Adam Scott. Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds.
938	938	1	1	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
451	451	19	19	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gotta give an some extra time looking into Bozzelli (55/1) and Spaun (45/1). I'm intrigued. Oh, if you want List at 33/1, get him now.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
2908	2908	14	15	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Jason Day; 2) Hideki Matsuyama; 3) James Hahn; 4) Tommy Fleetwood; 5) Tiger Woods; 6) Cameron Smith; 7) Emiliano Grillo / Patton Kizzire / Alex Noren; 10) Chesson Hadley; 11) Marc Leishman; 12) Charl Schwartzel; 13) Brian Harman / Si Woo Kim; 15) Austin Cook / Justin Rose / Sam Saunders; 18) Tyrrell Hatton; 19) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Zach Johnson / Ollie Schniederjans / Chris Stroud. Winners & Prices : 2017: Leishman 100/1 ; 2016: Day 14/1 ; 2015: Every 300/1 ; 2014: Every 66/1 ; 2013: Woods 3/1 ; 2012: Woods 8/1 ; 2011: Laird 45/1 ; 2010: Els 16/ 1; Average: 69/1.
13319	13319	54	56	target: Si Woo Kim, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously I say this with my tongue firmly in my cheek as my reasons for siding with Beau again this week go way beyond any kind of misguided loyalty. No, my main reason for backing Beau again this week is how hugely impressive I felt he was down the stretch in Houston and, unlike Si Woo Kim, until a couple of loose shots in the play off you could lay no fault at Beau’s door for him not taking the trophy home that week. Had this performance come out of the blue I would perhaps have been a bit more cautious but of course Hossler has been talked about as a potentially huge star of the game in the making for a long while now and he has been producing some good stuff on the tour all season without putting four rounds together until it all clicked in Houston.
239	239	61	62	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members. It does not get any better than this anywhere in the industry.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
314	314	37	37	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Field: Top 100 in FedExCup Standings  TPC Boston, Norton, MA  Par 71, 7,216 yards  The Course  This week the FedExCup Playoffs travel to TPC Boston where it has hosted this The Deutsche Bank since 2003. Its Labour Day weekend in The US so this tournament will go from Friday-Monday. It is a par 71 layout with three par 5’s, four par 3’s and 11 par 4’s and has a tendency to give up very low scores.
1476	1476	44	44	target: Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mr Consistency is the lowest-risk call across the $10m+ players this week and is sure to be in the mix at PGA West, coming off a strong putting performance at Waialae. Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut.
11206	11206	42	42	target: Anirban 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
246	246	19	20	target: Matt Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
3027	3027	19	19	target: Cejka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 is the year of the Canadians, EH?! Also consider: Peter Uihlein, J.J Spaun, Cameron Percy, David Hearn, Alex Cejka  These core players will garner the most exposure (40%+) in our lineups at the Puerto Rico Open. We will be using these lineups as staples and incorporating some of the deep sleepers you need at low ownership to take down a large GPP.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
4498	4498	23	23	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
4131	4131	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Everyone suffered from his missed cut last week. Now, Cink is merely an afterthought heading into the Valero Texas Open. Cink is still having a phenomenal season for his standards, consistently finishing inside the top 30 and making 11 of his last 13 cuts.
5425	5425	29	29	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
4713	4713	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has played this event the past two years and has 12th- and 10th-place finishes to show for it. Honorable Mentions: Jason Day ($10,100) and Brooks Koepka ($10,200)  I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is matt13jones) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on. Although I have expressed my personal view on the games and strategies above, they do not necessarily reflect the view(s) of DraftKings and I may also deploy different players and strategies than what I recommend above.
1600	1600	14	14	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm hoping Stallings' form lasts another week as I'm e/w on him, Henley &amp; Murray (long shot) at the Honda Classic. #golf #bettingtips
11582	11582	16	17	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think most will avoid because of the names around him and last week. Tier 2  Adam Hadwin $7,500 – Another guy who played well at the Genesis. He didn’t play here last year, but I like what I saw a couple weekends ago.
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
45	45	12	13	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
9725	9725	2	3	target: Daniel Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
10817	10817	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Its pretty much the antithesis to last week’s event from a TV standpoint. Golfers to Consider:  $16,000+  Dustin Johnson ($17,100)  The best player on the planet, there’s just no questioning it. Off the tee, he’s going to be in position to score almost every single time.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.
8438	8438	29	78	target: Jason Dufner / Russell Henley; 11) Francesco Molinari; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Ollie Schniederjans; 14) Charley Hoffman; 15) Tony Finau; 16) J.J. Henry / Marc Leishman / Xander Schauffele / Steve Stricker; 20) Blayne Barber. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Gary Woodland; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Chad Campbell; 6) Rickie Fowler / Ben Martin; 8) Graham DeLaet; 9) Jason Dufner / Russell Henley; 11) Francesco Molinari; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Ollie Schniederjans; 14) Charley Hoffman; 15) Tony Finau; 16) J.J. Henry / Marc Leishman / Xander Schauffele / Steve Stricker; 20) Blayne Barber. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 4) Matt Kuchar; 5) Paul Casey / Xander Schauffele; 7) Rickie Fowler; 8) Justin Thomas; 9) Sung Kang / Grayson Murray; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Daniel Berger / Jordan Spieth; 14) Jonas Blixt / Robert Streb; 15) D.A. Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark.
11467	11467	35	36	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why it is so hard to bypass Justin Thomas, who actually was leading the tournament after three rounds a year ago, a shot ahead of Johnson, but faded to a 1-over 72. Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous.
6803	6803	70	71	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
6324	6324	16	17	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently. Zac Blair ($7000) – On any course where accuracy matters more than distance, Blair has to be considered; the little Mormon hits 68.85% of fairways (15 th ) but struggles with longer distances – luckily with long approach shots (above 200), he’s 46 th on Tour and 20 th from 200-225. He’s not without his flaws, but he gains strokes on the greens, scores very well on par-3s (four of them on this course) and averages only 4.02 on par-4s.  )

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
6606	6606	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can be tilting to follow live so I don’t recommend watching every shot. However, at this price Finau can allow you to avoid having to punt in cash games. Danny Lee ($16,400) – A former winner at this event, Danny Lee is riding a hot streak.
10986	10986	13	14	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be decently low owned with all the names in this range. Bubba Watson $7,800 – Pretty good price for a guy who has won here twice. He is getting some form back, so I will try and hop on before he is super chalk.
8938	8938	3	4	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Emiliano Grillo  7. Luke List  8. Kevin Na  9.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
2188	2188	28	29	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
2601	2601	1	2	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
10945	10945	37	38	target: Chez Reavie, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is the first we have seen of Charl this season as he makes his way over to the States to gear up for Augusta. Charl has zero tags on FanShare Sports and is wedged in between Chez Reavie, Brendan Steele, and Thomas Pieters, all of whom are inside the top five most tagged early on this week. Charl missed the cut here last year, but he does have two top fives at this event in the past five years.
5299	5299	56	57	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World top 20 players in the form of Dustin Johnson and Lee Westwood have won this tournament in recent years, but so have Tour maidens Daniel Berger (33/1), Fabian Gomez (400/1), Harris English (66/1) and Harrison Frazar (275/1). This week the field includes Rickie Fowler (OWGR No.9), Adam Scott (No.12), Francesco Molinari (No.16), Charl Schwartzel (No.21), Brooks Koepka (No.22) and Phil Mickelson (No.23) who has decided to give next week's U.S. Open a miss. All in all though, it's traditionally one of the weaker tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule and offers a big opportunity for those whose game fits TPC Southwind.
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
1842	1842	69	70	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Standard eligibility rankings apply, whilst the following shall first be eligible:  AT&T Pebble Beach winners prior to 2000 and in the last five seasons The Players Championship and major championship winners prior to 2000 and in the last five years  In addition there is no Open Monday Qualifying for this event. Headlining the field is World No.1, Jason Day who is also joined by Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed from the world’s top-10. Day and Johnson will be looking for much better performances than they managed at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, as both players missed the cut in an event they were rightly favourites for.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
232	232	35	36	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
10405	10405	22	22	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 :  Old White: Winner: Xander Schauffele; EW Places: Streb, Lovemark, Henley, Kraft, Finau, Blaum. Chapultepec: Winner: Dustin Johnson; EW Places: Rahm, Thomas, Mickelson, Snedeker. Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
51	51	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lipsky &amp; Canizares in Switzerland and Reed and Woodland in the US for me this week. #golf #betting #tips
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
8211	8211	20	21	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RELATED: 13 picks to win the PGA Championship  And for those of you playing other fantasy golf formats:  Yahoo! lineup: Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm (Starters); Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Charley Hoffman, Brooks Koepka (Bench). Knockout/One-and-done pick: Rickie Fowler.
2286	2286	20	20	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won’t be over-owned because of an egregious miss price but also provides enough upside to stomach paying that price. Casey is one of my favorite bets on the board this week at 50-1 and is my early lean for a One and Done selection. Brandt Snedeker – $7,600  Your free space for the week is Brandt Snedeker.
1290	1290	18	19	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Focus aggressively on tee-to-green excellence and you will most likely be rewarded in kind. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays.
7740	7740	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/5 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brooks Koepka 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (5 places EW, 1/4 odds):  Jordan Spieth arrives at another strict ball-striking test as the bookies favourite this week and after riding his luck and putting incredibly well at the end to win The Open Championship a fortnight ago at Royal Birkdale, whether he can repeat that feat here remains to be seen. Firestone South isn't the best fit to Spieth's game, however the same could be said of the Southport links and we all saw what happened there.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
16	16	15	16	target: Harold Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
2022	2022	34	34	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Fiction. First, the only reason you could question Spieth’s recent performances is because he hasn’t won since the Dean and Deluca Invitational last year. And I get it – if Jordan is going to be the highest-priced player every week he tees it up, you really do want him to win.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.
10971	10971	16	17	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
1074	1074	16	17	target: Ryan Armour… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Interesting stat from Kapalua: Dustin Johnson had 39 opportunities for birdie or better inside 20 feet. Ryan Armour… https://t.co/GmdWS6oPSM
10543	10543	9	10	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the short list of truths to be self-evident, Hideki Matsuyama at the Waste Management Phoenix Open appears. No, the history doesn't predict the present, but we compete in an imperfect fantasy world. This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident.
577	577	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will.
11765	11765	2	2	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style.

7022	7022	14	14	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this cheap price tag, Luck is the perfect GPP play this week. Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.
2393	2393	17	18	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Great price, cash worthy. Economy  Billy Horschel $7,200  Nick Watney $7,100  Kyle Stanley $7,100  Martin Flores $7,100  Stewart Cink $7,100  That’s it for this week. I think it is a great week to focus on cash games and build some bankroll.
282	282	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
6628	6628	20	21	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because of that dynamic, ownership levels are projected to be fairly even among many of the high-priced guys. Not until James Hahn at $8,800 on DraftKings — he has the 14th-highest salary in the field — do we find someone projected for potential single-digit ownership at nine to 12 percent. Sung Kang is the first golfer below that; he’s $8,600 and is currently projected for five to eight percent ownership.
890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
8214	8214	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone? Jamie Lovemark (150-1): Seems to be made for majors this season – T-27 at U.S. Open and T-22 at British Open this year.
1151	1151	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY PICK : Henrik Stenson ($9,400)  It’s hard to pick one player to stand out from what is basically an all star field of golfers this week. Still, I do see this as an opportunity for Henrik Stenson to end his already amazing 2016 with a bang. Stenson won the Open Championship in maybe the most brilliant display of golf in a major ever, nearly won the Olympic gold and was just his usual cool self all year.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!

828	828	14	14	target: WEBB 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
5459	5459	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
3829	3829	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Brit returns to action at arguably his best course. Donald has never won at Harbour Town, but he has four runner-ups and two thirds. Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well.
1522	1522	0	0	target: CHOI 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CHOI has an impeccable record at Riviera. https://t.co/iNGBsDFpIs
9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.
2603	2603	27	27	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
12704	12704	54	55	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is also live coverage on BBC2 on Saturday and Sunday, and they also have Red Button coverage from mid-afternoon over the weekend, showing featured groups, Amen Corner, and holes 15 and 16. Last Ten Winners  2017 - Sergio Garcia -9 (playoff)  2016 - Danny Willett -5  2015 - Jordan Spieth -18  2014 - Bubba Watson -8  2013 - Adam Scott -9 (playoff)  2012 - Bubba Watson -10 (playoff)  2011 - Charl Schwartzel -14  2010 - Phil Mickelson -16  2009 - Angel Cabrera -12 (playoff)  2008 - Trevor Immelman -8  What Will it Take to Win the US Masters? Sergio Garcia's stats were incredible last year and it's hardly surprising he won.
11904	11904	19	20	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is quite a specialised event so strong results on Florida-type courses are essential. My selections are as follows:  Tiger Woods 4pts Win 7/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim here:  Tiger Woods with Florida form of 12/2 just has to be backed for his first PGA Tour win since 2013 here at Bay Hill where he's won the title across 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013.
12014	12014	1	1	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
13621	13621	64	65	target: Tommy Fleetwood; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) John Senden; 3) Emiliano Grillo / Kyle Stanley; 5) Keegan Bradley; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Daniel Berger; 8) Ryan Blaum; 9) Adam Hadwin / Brian Harman; 11) Alex Cejka / Tommy Fleetwood; 13) Jonathan Randolph; 14) Andrew Landry; 15) Kevin Kisner; 16) Vaughn Taylor; 17) Fabian Gomez / Alex Noren / Ted Potter Jnr / Webb Simpson / Kevin Streelman.

621	621	3	4	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@gfienberg17 JJ Spaun, Luke Donald, Jason Kokrak
2119	2119	120	121	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan / Kevin Streelman; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Daniel Berger; 6) Martin Kaymer / Francesco Molinari; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Charl Schwartzel; 10) Keegan Bradley; 11) Patrick Cantlay / Peter Uihlein; 13) Billy Horschel; 14) Branden Grace; 15) Dustin Johnson / Pat Perez / J.J.

Winners & Prices : 2017: Johnson 9/ 1; 2016: Watson 25/1 ; 2015: Hahn 200/ 1; 2014: Watson 33/1 ; 2013: Merrick 250 /1; 2012: Haas 50/1 ; 2011: Baddeley 100/1 ; 2010: Stricker 16/1 ; Average: 85/1.
3728	3728	12	12	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a significantly better putter than the two ahead of him. When Kisner was second to Furyk here, he put on a ball-striking clinic and a similar display should see him go close once more, his focus no doubt fixed on atoning for Bay Hill and winning on what's home soil for the South Carolina man, who practices nearby at Kiawah Island. As for going win-only, again that's largely so he can share the load with Snedeker, but I'm a big believer in Kisner's ability to get it done.
3618	3618	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
7890	7890	10	11	target: Charl Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			These are the type of events where he shines brightest. Charl Schwartzel $7,200 – Schwartzel is coming off a T12 at the Porsche European Open last week where he racked up 15 birdies and two eagles. He’s recorded two T10’s at Firestone Country Club in the last five years The South African ranks high in the field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach the Green and DraftKings Scoring.
5820	5820	6	6	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong. But the clincher with Rose this week is how he has played on courses similar to Erin Hills. Rose was 4th at Whistling Straits, 12th at Pinehurst No.2 but the most interesting one is his Scottish Open win.
6525	6525	11	12	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kokrak could be dangerous if he gets the flat stick rolling. Stewart Cink - $14,100    The 44-year-old veteran just continues to be under-priced, despite climbing to 53rd in the FedExCup standings with 13 top-30s in 20 events this season. Over his past 12 rounds, he’s 12th among the field in SG: T2G, 11th in SG: Approach and 14th in SG: Putting.
483	483	16	17	target: Shawn Stefani, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
4730	4730	30	30	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament. Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him.
9560	9560	48	49	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
320	320	2	2	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @Thomas_Pieters at 80/1 in the @WGCMexico. Pieters was second at Riviera recently and this course may share some similarities
6588	6588	25	25	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
13666	13666	63	64	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Daniel Berger, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Henley, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Ryan Palmer, Scott Piercy, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Keegan Bradley, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, J.B. Holmes, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Satoshi Kodaira, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Jon Rahm, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Steve Stricker, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Jhonattan Vegas, Johnson Wagner, Nick Watney, Bubba Watson, Gary Woodland. Trends in terms of recent winners are interesting to say the very least and that's hardly surprising at a tournament where the average odds of the winner since 2010 sits at 109/1 and across the last 4 years at a staggering 167/1.
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
2074	2074	4	5	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Do not fade them. Sergio Garcia ($9,300) – Outside of a missed cut here last year, few players have embraced the challenge of Riviera like Sergio. He is one of the absolute best ball strikers on the planet with surgical precision when he’s locked into his game, and based on the fact he just shipped the Dubai Desert a few weeks back, I would say that he’s feeling pretty good.
11788	11788	27	28	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Spieth sets goals, he generally achieves them. As a past champ here (2015), this is as good of spot as any to pick up that W.  Henrik Stenson ($11,600): It's been love at first sight for the Swede and Copperhead. He posted a solo fourth in his 2015 debut and has since returned to collect two more finishes of T11 or better.
3393	3393	12	13	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts.
327	327	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
12241	12241	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
2611	2611	47	48	target: Jason Dufner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
413	413	65	65	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He talks about his 1st Masters experience and the impact of Draft Kings and Fantasy Free View in iTunes  139 Clean WGC Cadillac 2016 W/ PGATour Caddie Paul Tesori PGATour Caddie, Paul Tesori talks about life on Tour, caddying for Webb Simpson, caddie preparation, and the Tesori Family Foundation on this week's episode.

807	807	3	3	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Anyone else feeling Grillo this week? I think this might be the big boys man party ive been predicting hes gonna crash very soon #ThePlayers
3849	3849	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Six starts, never has finished better than T-46. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Kevin Kisner. Runner-up here in 2015 and his game is such a good fit for Harbour Town.
1501	1501	42	42	target: Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I was counting all my money on Thursday and figuring out how it would be spent, only to watch in horror as guys went over par on Friday afternoon to completely ruin the week. I myself put way too much stock in Casey, who lost his putter Thursday going -4 SG: Putting, which is historically awful. Anyway, like I said last week it is early and we don’t know exactly how these guys are playing so I hope you went light.
720	720	17	17	target: Kim. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Better than feeling bad... All the An and Kang this week with a sprinkle of Lee and Kim. #TeamKorea https://t.co/TCc8MHOJgR
7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
7096	7096	38	39	target: Louis Oosthuizen, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some lists…. Top five finishers in last 6 Opens  2016 (Royal Troon): 1 Henrik Stenson, 2 Phil Mickelson, T3 J.B. Holmes, 4 Steve Stricker, T5 Sergio Garcia, Rory McIlroy, Tyrrell Hatton  2015 (St. Andrews): 1 Zach Johnson, T2 Louis Oosthuizen, Marc Leishman, T5 Jason Day, Jordan Spieth  2014 (Hoylake): 1 Rory McIlroy, T2 Sergio Garcia, Rickie Fowler, 4 Jim Furyk, T5 Adam Scott, Marc Leishman  2013 (Muirfield): 1 Phil Mickelson, 2 Henrik Stenson, T3 Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Adam Scott  2012 (Royal Lytham): 1 Ernie Els, 2 Adam Scott, T3 Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker, T5 Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald  2011 (Royal St. George’s): 1 Darren Clarke, T2 Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, 4 Thomas Bjorn, 5 Chad Campbell, Anthony Kim, Rickie Fowler  That’s 36 players if you’re counting. By region?
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
8954	8954	35	36	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The weather forecast for KL looks mixed with rain and thunderstorms a distinct possibility. Venue: TPC Kuala Lumpur (West), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Date: Oct 12-15  Course stats: par 72, 7,005 yards  Purse: $7,000,000  Defending champion: Justin Thomas (-23)  TV Coverage:  Thursday 12 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Friday 13 – Sky Sports Golf from 3.30am  Saturday 14 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Sunday 15 – Sky Sports Golf from 4am  Player Watch:  Justin Thomas is obviously going to be heavy favourite but he will face strong competition. There are a number of European players who might threaten, three of those are:  Paul Casey – He was on brilliant form in the second half of the season but was unable to convert and secure a victory.

10598	10598	53	54	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2018 Waste Management Open field is loaded. Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley.
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
10976	10976	22	23	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
5969	5969	43	43	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut at Erin Hills and doesn't have the look of a top-5 player at the moment, but he showed promise at the Memorial and turned in a runner-up at the Nelson. If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
11432	11432	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood – $10,000  All aboard the Fleetwood train…once again. Make it three straight weeks of being in on Fleetwood and I apologize for being repetitive, but when a world class ball striker is affordable and a good course fit, he becomes a “jam him in” play. Fleetwood gained 6.1 strokes on approach shots at the Honda Classic last week, something we should start getting use to.
11789	11789	22	23	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Showing signs of life recently, I'm going to try to jump aboard before the masses jump back on the Texan. DraftKings Picks:    Henrik Stenson ($10,200): Don't have to pay a premium for the Orlando resident that has finished T11 or better in all three visits to the Valspar. Matt Kuchar ($8,200): Should see his ownership plummet after a poor putting performance in Mexico.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.

412	412	18	19	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Related: 2016 European Ryder Cup team  This week it’s the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston in Massachusetts. Rickie Fowler defends after beating Henrik Stenson to the title last year. Fowler now needs a wildcard pick from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III so will only have eyes for the win, especially after last week where he held the 54 hole lead and couldn’t quite get the job done.
2214	2214	2	2	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
4879	4879	46	47	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson are both two-time winners, Jordan Spieth was runner-up in 2015 before winning last year and 2015 champ Chris Kirk had a previous top five as well as making the top 15 the year before his win. So I'm naturally drawn to Kevin Kisner, who has a T10 and a T5 in the last two years. Kisner recovered from an over-par opener with 66-69-66 to sneak into the top 10 last year and in 2015 he posted three 67s and a 69 to finish just two shots behind winner Kirk.
1403	1403	5	5	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyJesusDFS Did u factor in Noren hangover?
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
5626	5626	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale. Scott historically has struggled on the greens, consistently finishing in the bottom third of the rankings, but he’s actually having a fairly decent year in that regard – he’s 34th in Strokes Gained: Putting, mainly due to his putting outside 10’.
8679	8679	104	105	target: Kevin Na; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Paul Casey / Henrik Stenson; 3) Jordan Spieth; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Marc Leishman; 6) Gary Woodland; 7) Rickie Fowler / Zach Johnson; 9) Sergio Garcia; 10) Charley Hoffman; 11) Lucas Glover; 12) Patrick Cantlay; 13) Russell Henley; 14) Jason Day / Luke List; 16) Hudson Swafford; 17) Jason Dufner / Dustin Johnson / Brendan Steele; 20) Francesco Molinari / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka / Justin Thomas; 3) Jason Day; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Dustin Johnson; 6) Xander Schauffele; 7) Grayson Murray; 8) Rickie Fowler; 9) Jon Rahm; 10) Paul Casey / Kevin Na; 12) Webb Simpson / Robert Streb; 14) Henrik Stenson; 15) Hideki Matsuyama; 16) Matt Kuchar; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Zach Johnson; 19) Patrick Reed; 20) Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices : 2016: D Johnson 10/1 ; 2015: Day 15/2 ; 2014: Horschel 66/1 ; 2013: Z Johnson 40/1 ; 2012: McIlroy 7/1 ; 2011: Rose 66/1 ; 2010: D Johnson 33/1 ; Average: 33/1.
2869	2869	23	53	target: Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is horses for courses type of venue - as Matt Every showed two years ago - and so I'm happy to chance Zach on the strength of his six top-11 finishes here and Morgan and on the strength of his fourth placed finish two years ago, when he arguably should have won. Johnson comes here in fair form if we ignore his poor effort in Mexico and Hoffman was runner-up at the Honda in his penultimate start, so both have course and current form enough to tempt me in. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [14.0]  Hideki Matsuyama @ [18.0]  Zach Johnson @ [75.0]  Morgan Hoffman @ [250.0]    There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog.
10541	10541	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate teams are no fun and don't help anyone. FanDuel Picks:    Zach Johnson ($10,600): He's fully synced up with his latest equipment from PXG. Typically runs hot or cold, so I will keep riding the hot streak while it's here.
6965	6965	76	77	target: Rory Sabbatini; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
11764	11764	12	13	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Army Pricing – Use code PGA for 10% off membership! Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since.
8862	8862	64	64	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has been playing some good golf lately and I look forward to seeing him play this week. He is a guy that has burned me more times than he has helped me out in Draftkings, but I have a feeling that a lot of other people will feel the same way and hopefully pivot to someone else in his price range like Kuchar, Garcia, Simpson, Reed, Hoffman, or Finau. I wouldn't call him a "core" player but he's the kind of guy you could see at the top of the leaderboard on Thursday and beat yourself up all weekend for not playing him.
2189	2189	18	18	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
1810	1810	9	10	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Brooks Koepka – $9,100  Last week at Torrey Pines, people piled up on the bombers with Brooks Koepka being one of them. He disappointed a lot of DFSers with a missed cut and now finds himself at a price with plenty of other good options right below him.
5942	5942	36	37	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To make things even more appetizing, Thomas tied for third at last year’s Travelers and will look to break through for his fifth career win, and first on the U.S. mainland. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts.
9983	9983	25	25	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's jump in and take a look at this weeks tag counts. $10K Range  The top tier is small with just five golfers but Rahm, Harman, and Mickelson lead the way in the tag count with Rahm sitting with a commanding lead in start recommendations. I will have the most exposure to Mickelson in this tier but think there is a nice pivot opportunity with Patrick Reed.
3675	3675	54	90	target: Adam Scott ($8,800) – T9 Jon Rahm ($8,600) – T27 Justin Rose ($9,200) – 2 Paul Casey ($7,800) – 6 Russell Henley ($7,200) – T11 Phil Mickelson ($8,700) – T22 Hedge (Minority of Cash Lines) Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			E-Mail Exclusive Picks (FREE, sign up for our newsletter to receive it as well as exclusive discount codes!)

We had Rickie, Rose, Casey, Phil, Scott, Rahm, Henley, Sneds, and Spieth all looking rather sharp.
9368	9368	18	19	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the Sentry Tournament of Champions (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Marc Leishman  Hideki Matsuyama  Jordan Spieth  Justin Thomas    You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks.

Cameron Smith … First-timer comin' in hot.
6292	6292	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
7226	7226	28	29	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose. Yeah, it’s maybe too corny to happen.
3023	3023	5	5	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stay tuned! Core Players  Luke List ($9,900): List can absolutely crush the ball. The rough here isn’t as penal as we saw last weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational where the ball just stuck in the rough.
4077	4077	12	12	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure List make your list among value plays this week. JJ Spaun $7,800 – Spaun is a Web.com graduate, making a huge impact on the PGA Tour in his first season. He gains strokes off the tee and makes a ton of birdies.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.

4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!

3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him.

5805	5805	26	26	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African also has posted consecutive top-five finishes at the U.S. Open, which leads me to believe he is ready to strike again. At $7,700, Grace is a great option for a mid-priced golfer when building your FanDuel lineups this week for the season's second major. -- Erik Dantoft
6362	6362	20	20	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has just been so damn consistent this season compared to the other options it’s pretty much a no brainer. Fowler is the clear favorite to win this week and is obviously the least likely to miss the cut. If you have to back only one golfer from +$10k, it’s 100% Fowler.
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
938	938	1	1	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
12707	12707	1	2	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely. I'm not sure how much credence we can give it but recent history suggests a late start on day one is beneficial as the last seven winners have all teed off late on day one.
10810	10810	25	25	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I used this chart earlier with Reavie, but I love how it shows a golfer’s performance compared to how the field did for that round. Kuchar rarely disappoints us relative to the competition or any given round which makes him a superb building block anytime we can catch him for a fair price. Below $14,000  Rafa Cabrera Bello ($13,800)  Seems the flavor of this range is European’s lately.
8930	8930	3	4	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Knox  11. Anirban Lahiri  12. Peter Uihlein  13.
1982	1982	12	13	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
12886	12886	22	22	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a top 5 already, he made the cut last year shooting 2 under par rounds along the way without contending. Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance.
7023	7023	1	1	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events. There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event.
1254	1254	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And until we see otherwise, Day is still among the very best putters in the game. Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that.
11596	11596	4	4	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Mayo welcomes Deshaun Watson, Joe Theismann, Jermichael Finley, Jamie Erdahl, Greg Jennings, Matt Mitrione, Kathryn Tappen, Jamey Eisenberg and many more into the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row. SHOW INDEX 1:29 Deshaun Watson 32 Free View in iTunes  106 Clean 2018 Fantasy Football - Tuesday on Radio Row Special with Stefon Diggs and many more! Pat Mayo welcomes Stefon Diggs, Chris Rose, Road Warrior Animal, Andy Benoit, Judy Battista, Caleb Truax, and Dave Hunt to the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
5590	5590	19	20	target: Jordan Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
2603	2603	26	27	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
12082	12082	25	26	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Aussie is killing it off the tee, sticking his irons, chipping well and, as usual, missing more 3-foot putts than everyone else combined. Classic Adam Scott. He’s lost almost three strokes per start over his last three events, yet he has churned out solid finishes since the Tour moved to the East Coast (T13/T16).
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
3098	3098	29	29	target: Garrigus. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one of the biggest hitters on the Web.com Tour last year. He checks the box in Birdie or Better % and SG: Off the Tee, much like Garrigus. The Mulli-man has missed the cut in his last two events, but he could bounce back in this weak field.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
6830	6830	11	13	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, let’s try and cultivate some John Deere Picks! Top Tier  Charles Howell III $9,000 – I like that we can roster him a little discount from last week. He hasn’t missed the cut here since 2012, which was his only one in 7 appearances.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
11182	11182	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It won’t surprise me one bit to see Martin use his world-class tee two green game to propel himself to a top 20 finish this week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7.9K) – In this outing, the South African makes his season debut and looks for his elusive first win stateside. Louis Oosthuizen played well here last year.
5437	5437	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week. Daniel Summerhays – $7,800  We all got to see Daniel Summerhays battle it out last week, and because of that, I think there will be more people who jump on Summerhays than there should be.
13195	13195	1	1	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
2936	2936	24	24	target: McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think these are the type of weeks when the cream rises to the top. For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico.
4563	4563	26	26	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott won The PLAYERS all the way back in 2004 and hasn’t missed a cut in his last five tries. We are all well aware of Scott’s ball striking ability that can put him in contention week after week. It is just a matter of if his putter will show up or not.
67	67	25	26	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
4114	4114	37	38	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2452	2452	18	19	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tee-to-green behemoth with the ability to dominate this golf course as he has so many others. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – So he shot an 80 at Riviera on a tough, windy day. That shouldn’t make him $1,800 cheaper than DJ.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
3654	3654	101	111	target: Kevin Streelman; 14) Francesco Molinari; 15) Michael Thompson; 16) Kevin Kisner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Waste Management Phoenix Open / Maybank Championship and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Emiliano Grillo / Steve Stricker; 3) Vaughn Taylor; 4) Ryan Blaum; 5) Ryan Moore; 6) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Jim Furyk; 8) Brian Harman / Martin Laird; 10) Adam Hadwin; 11) Chad Campbell; 12) David Hearn / Kevin Streelman; 14) Francesco Molinari; 15) Michael Thompson; 16) Kevin Kisner; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Fabian Gomez; 19) Russell Knox; 20) Tyrrell Hatton. Greens in Regulation : 1) Michael Thompson; 2) Adam Hadwin; 3) Charles Howell III; 4) Paul Casey / Brian Harman / Luke List; 7) Patrick Cantlay; 8) Dustin Johnson; 9) Charley Hoffman; 10) Chris Kirk / Scott Piercy / Xander Schauffele; 13) Ross Fisher / Emiliano Grillo; 15) Jason Kokrak; 16) Francesco Molinari / Harold Varner III; 18) Corey Conners / Lucas Glover / James Hahn.
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
3304	3304	28	29	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson has burned DFS players in his last two outings but carries a 69.6 scoring average at this tournament over his last three visits. I also like Rickie Fowler who has figured this course out recently with two top-10s here over the past three years. Australians have a nice record at this event and Adam Scott (a former winner) could go overlooked due to his lack of play.
2028	2028	10	11	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
481	481	14	15	target: Kelly Kraft, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
6252	6252	64	65	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m not prioritizing it when selecting golfers this week. Here’s how the top 20 percent of golfers in Rec metrics perform:  Adj Rd Score: -1.37  GIR: -2.39  DD: -2.09  DA: -2.82  SC: -2.60  Adj Bird Avg: -6.45  A Few Names to Remember (From Comparable Courses)  Among golfers with at least five starts in our database at these two comparable courses, both Chad Campbell and Scott Stallings have been consistent, exceeding salary-based expectations in five of their six outings (83.3 percent). Campbell is not in the field this week, but Stallings is, priced at $6,900 on DraftKings and $5,300 on FanDuel.
3394	3394	14	15	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts. With Adam, you can always take that his long game is going to be good, so for me, and I don’t know what the betting is, but if there’s value in the price of Adam Scott, that’s who I’d go with.
8143	8143	11	12	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Enough with the BS let’s get to some picks. Winner Section  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Disclaimer: I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Jordan Spieth. Well mostly just hate.
1761	1761	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surely the tare has to end somewhere, soon?!? $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Ryan Moore ($8.6m) and Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); Brendan Steele is unlikely to disappoint at $8.2 million. 5th (2012), 5th (2013) and 6th (2014) tell you all you need to know about his liking for this test, but his recalcitrant putter is likely to keep him away from the ultimate victory.
607	607	6	6	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
5436	5436	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week.
7839	7839	18	19	target: Brooks Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: JB Holmes  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jon Rahm, Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka, Russell Henley  – Branden Grace, Gary Woodland, Thomas Pieters, Bill Haas, Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel, JB Holmes  Bets:  Gary Woodland 70-1 He’ll be looking to make his mark in a big event soon and this could easily be the place. He finished T17 here in 2015 and was near his second win of the season the last time he played in the USA.
438	438	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also a former champion here, so I certainly won't talk you off of him in tournaments. Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format.
8227	8227	7	7	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts.
10499	10499	8	9	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this stage, I'll just mention one pick. J.B. Holmes is a twice former winner of this title and has a couple of further top-six finishes among his record. He's always been a very streaky type but well capable of winning when in form, so last week's return to contention at Torrey Pines could be significant.
1032	1032	3	3	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
851	851	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has a power game that travels well. Brooks Koepka. Has a power game that travels well.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
13668	13668	33	34	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
6732	6732	99	101	target: Charles Howell III; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Boo Weekley; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Steve Alker / Ryan Moore / Steve Stricker; 7) Spencer Levin; 8) Ben Crane / Kyle Stanley; 10) Chad Campbell; 11) Tim Wilkinson; 12) Zac Blair / Daniel Summerhays; 14) Scott Brown; 15) Nick Taylor; 16) Zach Johnson / Johnson Wagner; 18) Kevin Kisner / William McGirt; 20) Danny Lee / J.J.

7958	7958	22	31	target: Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The North Carolina track has staged the regular-season Wells Fargo Championship (previously Quail Hollow Championship and Wachovia Championship) on 13 occasions and Rory took the trophy in 2010 and 2015. Rory McIlroy is responsible for two of those victories and he’s also the only Euro to have tasted victory at this week’s course, Quail Hollow. With four wins in the last nine editions of the PGA Championship, Europe has reversed a dreadful record in the year’s final major.
7926	7926	65	66	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Par-4 Birdie or Better %  Greens in Regulation %  Long Approach (over 175 yards) – this will have to be an amalgamation of the 175-200 and >200 statistics. Par-4 Efficiency Above 450 Yards  Driving Distance %  The Golfers  Rickie Fowler ($10700) – In a field this stacked, it’s tough to pick just one of the elite golfers, because they all have win upside (Rahm/DJ), excellent course history (Rory/Rickie) or recent form (Spieth/Koepka). Going stars and scrubs would allow for two of these guys, but with a lot of value plays below the $7500 range available that is sure to be a popular strategy – nailing down one elite player and picking from the 8k range to fill out the lineup might be a tough pill to swallow, but it’ll lead to lower overall ownership and less chance of being duplicated.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
708	708	13	13	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			100 to 1 bets that should peak your interest Danny Lee Cam Smith JT Poston Scott Piercy
6588	6588	24	24	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
7369	7369	5	6	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ will be just fine. Rory McIlroy – $11,000  What to do with Rory this week could actually be the million dollar question. He has been very bad lately, missing three of his last four cuts.
774	774	7	7	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@WellsFargoGolf PGA Picks Scott +1800 Berger +3300 McGirt +4000 Holmes +4000 Varner +10000 --- Reed +4000 Poston +11000 🇸🇪Porn👑 +25000
310	310	1	1	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, McIlroy value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP… https://t.co/9OP07g5IZt
7570	7570	17	18	target: Ben Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
12657	12657	20	22	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Additionally, he has experienced plenty of success in Houston, making five of six cuts since 2012, with four Top-15 finishes. Charles Howell III  In the year of players who never win hosting a novelty check, maybe CH3 is next? He has gained at least 3.8 strokes tee-to-green in each of last six events, good for a fifth-place rank against the field in that span.
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
2350	2350	13	14	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take the South African with odds of +4000 given his current form. Adam Scott - Adam Scott is the overall favorite to win the Honda Classic, but you can still fetch him with odds of +1100. Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open.
8163	8163	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler has been on the precipice all season long, and he'll be licking his chops at having his final chance for a major this season at a course he plays so well. Brooks Koepka (DK: $9,200, FD: $8,600)    When we talk about guys who are long off the tee, we have to include Koepka. He's a type of player that I always target in majors and has gained the most strokes against the field in majors over the past two years.
5077	5077	43	43	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first round W/Ds to his history, he hasn’t missed the cut here going back to 2008. There’s not a lot to dislike about Mickelson for cheap, and paired with Fleetwood he leaves a lot of room up top. Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
7177	7177	7	7	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
11206	11206	42	43	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
10397	10397	7	19	target: Scottsdale is a track where he can certainly win. RESULT: T17 Scott Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Justin is close and TPC Scottsdale is a track where he can certainly win. RESULT: T17  Scott Piercy 1pt EW 66/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply. (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Scott Piercy is a decent shout for this week as the Las Vegas resident always tends to show well in his native environment.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
416	416	7	7	target: Merritt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First @APinv bet is @TROYMERRITT_PGA at 469/1. Merritt is a @PGATOUR winner and should enjoy his Bay Hill return where he was 3rd last year
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome.

Yahoo!
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship

10954	10954	39	40	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Targeting a multitude of mid-tier golfers might be a better choice, as strong plays like Branden Grace, Tommy Fleetwood, Alex Noren and Marc Leishman can all be had for less than $10,000. Other strong targets for this format include Paul Casey, Branden Steele, Ollie Schniederjans, Martin Kaymer, Charles Howell III, Martin Laird and Brandon Harkins. Tournaments – It feels like a week where Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could easily go under-owned due to poor recent form or poor course history.
1716	1716	10	10	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some early observations from the @DraftKings prices for the WGC-Mexico: DJ and Thomas are far and away the top two,… https://t.co/3vuhD74OJh
8680	8680	30	43	target: Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Stewart Cink, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Lucas Glover, Brian Harman, Hideki Matsuyama, Jhonattan Vegas. 1 - Keegan Bradley, Bryson DeChambeau, Bill Haas, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Sean O'Hair, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter, Chez Reavie, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Kyle Stanley, Henrik Stenson, Justin Thomas. The BMW Championship, the third leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, has a number of trends that are intriguing.
1914	1914	40	41	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
2571	2571	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide. He had back-to-back T3 finishes at Crans-sur Sierre in 2014 and 2015.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
2528	2528	47	47	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East. Fleetwood beat a field including Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson to land the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and while that event does tend to see the favourites come up short on what’s typically their first start in months, this year’s winner is good enough to use victory as a springboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time.
7323	7323	35	35	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
5720	5720	18	19	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency. His good run of form began back in January where he finished T4 at the windy Waialae Country Club, home of the Sony Open.
6148	6148	38	39	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall though, scoring conditions will likely be ideal throughout, so expect regular low scores here and possibly something in the high teens to win. Last six winners  2016 –- Russell Knox -14 (over Jerry Kelly -13)  2015 — Bubba Watson -16 (over Paul Casey in playoff)  2014 — Kevin Streelman -15 (over Sergio Garcia and KJ Choi -14)  2013 — Ken Duke -12 (over Chris Stroud in playoff)  2012 — Marc Leishman -14 (over Charley Hoffman and Bubba Watson -13)  2011 — Fredrik Jacobson -20 (over Ryan Moore and John Rollins -19)  Winning Trends  Four of the last seven winners of the Travelers have been first-time winners on the PGA Tour. Three of the last four winners of this event were coming into the week off of missed cuts in their previous start.
2029	2029	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
10976	10976	23	23	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
7613	7613	35	36	target: Patrick Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The results of events following a major tend to be fairly wide open because of the weaker base of players playing in these events. The first potential value that stands out on this chart is Patrick Rodgers who has roughly 60:1 odds to win this week despite a mere $7,000 price tag. The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat.
541	541	6	6	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
5044	5044	48	49	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Memorial Tournament is always a highlight of the PGA Tour as its Invitational status, combined with its positioning close to the second Major Championship, guarantees a high class field. 2018 doesn't disappoint with Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Henrik Stenson and 5 times Memorial winner Tiger Woods all in attendance. In all, 11 of the World's top-16 ranked players are in Dublin, Ohio this week.
5836	5836	111	132	target: Jason Kokrak – 0.25pt ew @ 150/1 1st Round Leader Stephan Jaeger – 0.25pt ew @ 200/1 1st Round Leader Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Summary of Bets  Justin Rose – 3pts ew @ 25/1 (Betfair Sportsbook – 1/5th odds, 8 places)  Rickie Fowler – 1pt ew @ 22/1 (Skybet – 1/5th odds, 8 places)  Russell Henley – 0.5pt win @ 200 on Exchange and 1.5pts Top 20 @ 5/1  Kevin Chappell – 0.5pt win @ 80 on Exchange and 1pt Top 10 @ 6/1  Brendan Steele – 0.5pt win @ 230 on Exchange and 1.5pts Top 20 @ 5/1  Tyrrell Hatton – 0.5pt win @ 180 on Exchange and 1pt Top 20 @ 5/1  George Coetzee – 0.5pt win @ 450 and 1pt Top 20 @ 8/1  Thomas Pieters – 2pts Top 10 @ 4/1  Jason Kokrak – 0.25pt ew @ 150/1 1st Round Leader    Stephan Jaeger – 0.25pt ew @ 200/1 1st Round Leader  Jason Day – 0.5pt ew @ 25/1 1st Round Leader  David Lingmerth – 0.25 pt ew @ 100/1 1st Round Leader  (All 1st Round Leader bets are with Betfair Sportsbook 7 places at 1/5 odds)  Weekly pts advised – 21pts    Total 2017 pts advised – 280pts  @theGreek  Advertisements Worth a go at a general 100/1. The Swede enjoys a tough test of golf and he has an early tee-time on Thursday.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
12048	12048	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut. The following week Hatton’s ownership was much lower and we saw him finish T3 against a loaded field.
2153	2153	40	40	target: Dustin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera hasn’t been a place where players suddenly “find their games” and as the sort main event of the West Coast swing, emphasizing players who have performed well at the previous few events is not a bad idea. Stud Picks  Dustin Johnson ($11,400): Hard to argue with Dustin at all this week. Some point to Pebble Beach as his favorite course but this venue might actually suit him better.
3492	3492	2	2	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year, Oosthuizen got all the way to final of the Match Play (losing out to Jason Day) before missing the cut in Houston and he may just benefit from the extra lay-off this time around. Statistically Oosthuizen does not leap of the page, but ranks highly in some of the key Strokes Gained departments including, Strokes Gained: Off-the-tee (18th), Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green (21st) and Strokes Gained: Around-the-Green: (36th). His putting will need to improve this week, but Augusta greens are a different challenge than anything the South African has faced this season and he knows exactly what to expect of them, after eight starts here.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
2287	2287	9	10	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Justin Rose – $8,400  Hear me out for a second. No, Justin Rose didn’t necessarily burn you last week, but you could say he underwhelmed.
1169	1169	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s supposed to be taking some time off for back issues — but he couldn’t resist the guaranteed large paycheck by playing in his own backyard — so approach with caution. Bubba Watson ($7,600): The defending champion is third in the field with a 312.8-yard LT DD, and he ranks seventh with a 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. His 6.7 percent Odds to Win are the best among this middle third of golfers.
5637	5637	14	15	target: Brooks Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Wood, Bernd Wiesberger  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jason Day, Brooks Koepka, Alex Noren, Marc Leishman, Branden Grace, Adam Scott, Branden Steele, Jordan Spieth  – Thomas Pieters, Louis Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Sean O’Hair, Chris Wood, Patrick Reed, George Coetzee, Bernd Wiesberger  Bets:  Jason Day 12-1  Alex Noren 55-1 ew  Louis Oosthuizen 67-1  Marc Leishman 125-1/100-1 ew  George Coetzee 250-1 ew Two top fives in his last three starts means O’Hair shouldn’t be forgotten about this week. His best finish last season was also on a US Open venue at Beth Page Black when he finished T2 at the Barclays.
3310	3310	28	29	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has top 20 upside this here this week and is a really nice value at only $7,300, that can be used in both cash games and GPPs. Jason Dufner: (7,100) Dufner is another player who is just way too cheap for how consistent he has been this season. The 70th ranked player in the world has been great, only missing one cut this season, and finishing no worse than T25 in all of the events he has made the cut.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
947	947	15	15	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First look at the #RSMClassic board, few long shots sticking out. Cook 80-1 Tway 100-1 Power 125-1 Wise 125-1 Ha… https://t.co/9aSkYXRGx2
814	814	4	4	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Par 4 Scoring – Koepka, Castro, Cauley, McGirt, Simpson  3. Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5.
7675	7675	32	32	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Dustin Johnson ($11,800) – Wow, Jordan Spieth is the highest priced. I guess I get it, but for this course, give me DJ all day.
4460	4460	11	11	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form here makes pretty grim reading, despite making 3/3 cuts. Grace has not managed to finish better than T42, as he seemingly struggles to put four rounds together here. In 2013 he posted a final round 77, to fall 30 places, after getting inside the top-10 earlier in the round.
11530	11530	79	80	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”  Last Week Rank: 16,851  Season Rank: 4872 *Did not play most of Segment 1*  Starters:  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Branden Grace  Marc Leishman  Bench:  Justin Thomas  Paul Casey        Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Mo Yoshimoto    “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Rank: 2063  Season Rank: 384  Starters:  Jordan Spieth  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Bubba Watson  Bench:  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay    ~    One-and-Done      Each week I will think out loud about my process in determining my One-and-Done selection. If you are new to the One-and-Done format, it is like an NFL survivor league.
3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
8161	8161	30	30	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can see a top 10 or top five for him, which I really can’t see for many guys under $7,000. Webb Simpson (DK: $6,800, FD: $6,000)    Beyond McIlroy and Fowler, there isn’t another player in the field who has racked up the consistent results at Quail Hollow than Simpson. He is a member at the course and a Charlotte native who seems to love the hometown vibes.
4117	4117	43	44	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2032	2032	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
3766	3766	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets. Horschel nearly won on a couple similar tracks already this season at the Honda Classic and the RSM Classic so he also has some corollary form to rely.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
5435	5435	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is too much risk and barely any upside with Gay this week. Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt.
7174	7174	23	23	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Sergio sees a lot of ownership because of this but I will still be overweight on him for the week. Henrik Stenson – GPP – DK: $9600 FD: $8700  Stenson is quietly showing good form just in time to defend his Open Championship title. With a T10 and a T26 in his last two events, I am not worried about his earlier season struggles.
2881	2881	4	4	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A no brainer. Tyrrell Hatton ($9,100) – “Impressive” would be putting it lightly for Tyrrell Hatton this year in his transition to being a part-time PGA player. Hatton contended for the win at the very tough PGA National and made a nice run in Mexico two weeks ago – he has not finished worse than T13 worldwide in his last four starts.
261	261	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is definitely hard enough to punish even some of the very best, so I would still consider it to be a potentially palatable investment opportunity. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Jason Day ($12,500) and Dustin Johnson ($12,100) – I hate to sound like a broken record here, but these two simply cannot be bested in terms of their sheer combination of power, accuracy, and precision. While they both bear some risk at their salary levels, I think it would be outrageous to fade them with their current form and proven ability to take this course apart.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
6734	6734	46	48	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A result footprint which includes 7th at Copperhead, 9th at Quail Hollow, 5th at TPC Four Seasons, 6th at Colonial, 3rd at TPC River Highlands and 4th at Robert Trent Jones GC also links well to the likes of Stricker, Johnson, Spieth and Moore. Result: WD  Charles Howell III 1.5pts EW 40/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (7 places, 1/5 odds) :  Charles Howell III is playing some great stuff right now and despite being a 'long time between drinks' as Ian Baker-Finch put it at the Quicken Loans National, the Augusta, Georgia man is well worth following this week.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship
4075	4075	8	9	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We love Finau in cash or GPP contests. Luke List $7,600 – List missed the cut last week at The Heritage at a course that was NOT suited for him, but was in tremendous form prior. He was owned around 15 percent in most DraftKings GPPs and may go a little under utilized this week.

12008	12008	3	3	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
2315	2315	31	32	target: (Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a result, international players have reigned supreme at PGA National since the Honda Classic made it the host course in 2007. In 10 events, a non-American has won seven times (Adam Scott, Padraig Harrington, Rory McIlroy, Rory Sabbatini, Camilo Villegas, YE Yang & Ernie Els). And when Team Uncle Sam decides to vault into the winner’s circle, it’s not exactly the who’s who of the sport: Russell Henley (2014), Michael Thompson (2013) & Mark Wilson (2007).

172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1561	1561	5	5	target: Bae 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Taken a chance on Sangmoon Bae at 169/1 and 13/2 for the top 20 in the #GenesisOpen. Bae loves Riviera and has fini… https://t.co/lpLOmpQz73
1010	1010	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk - $11,300  2. Charles Howell III - $9,200  3. Cody Gribble - $8,400  4.
3028	3028	25	25	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
12575	12575	35	35	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will always be a popular player in terms of ownership, and generally the highest priced golfer gets a little bump just because. I will much rather spend the $100 less for the lower owned Rose who likely has a greater win probability. Luke List – $9,600  Welcome to Luke List chalk week.
5215	5215	0	0	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan has had success at this event before and clearly found something last week. This looks like a time to build some Spieth lineups in tournaments to capitalize on a potentially huge leverage play. Jason Day – $10,300  Similar to Spieth, Jason Day has shown a recent glimpse of great form with runner up finish at the Byron Nelson, yet the talk of DJ and Rahm is drawing people away from Day.
1009	1009	1	3	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8. Charles Howell III - A strong player on Sea Island and off to a good start this season with a pair of top-15s. Never much of a threat to win, but good for points.
591	591	8	9	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ThePME Not going to be original but like Luke List this week. T13 at both RSM and Sony, T10 last year's Honda so c… https://t.co/fHmZPLhbnL
7706	7706	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His play has been strong all year, and as his record proves, Firestone is a good track for him. Also like: Adam Scott, Branden Grace and Alex Noren. The Aussie is a past champ and has mostly been in good form this year.
8326	8326	543	544	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The MDF rule is in effect if more than 78 golfers make the original cut.

570	570	10	10	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
330	330	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed — It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it’s hard to see why he doesn’t deserve a look again this week. He’s in America Mode.
5227	5227	29	29	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His missed cut will still be hurting those he burned, and his price tag this week won’t be drawing them back in. $8,700 is a lot to pay for Dufner at this event, but he will not have any ownership on him this week so rostering 5% of him will likely put you overweight on him. He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
4556	4556	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better time than the PLAYERS. Rickie Fowler – $9,300  It is all or nothing for Rickie Fowler at TPC Sawgrass. Literally.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
10729	10729	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
3543	3543	21	21	target: Hadwin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,900) Hadwin has been one of my go to guys all season and I am not going to let his lack of course history pull me off him now. It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field.
154	154	11	11	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If I were playing #pga #dfs this week I would have Fowler in 100% my line ups. He is #1 in my @TFFDFS rankings. Matsu and Stenson high too.
3632	3632	23	23	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bernd Wiesberger 20% – Plays consistent tee to green golf and he’s made both of his cuts at Augusta because of it. Like Haas, one year his putter will catch fire and he’ll spike. THE SINGLES  Emiliano Grillo
576	576	33	34	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This wouldn’t quite be a Billy Horschel story of coming out of nowhere to win, but Casey would be a surprise winner, and makes for a good 2nd golfer in lineups this week. Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week.
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
1346	1346	5	5	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Saving the best for last, Casey ranked 2nd in GIR last season and is 31st thus far in 2017. Casey is the sixth-highest salaried player this week but ranks as the top play for us. His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s.
4704	4704	46	47	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In order to make birdies on the par-fours, one-putt percentage and SG: putting will ultimately separate the contenders from the coasters. FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Dustin Johnson - $20,700  Jordan Spieth - $18,400  Sergio Garcia - $18,100  Brooks Koepka - $17,400    Cash-game Target (50/50s, Double-Ups): With Johnson and Spieth outside of the ultimate comfort zone in terms of affordability when building a cash-game squad, Koepka will be a popular candidate as the highest-priced player in many lineups. He held the lead after three rounds during the 2016 Byron Nelson, but eventually fell to Garcia in a Sunday playoff.
5271	5271	9	10	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be high owned, so go big! Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,600 – It’s no secret Kiz is in great form after winning the Dean & Deluca last week. He’s an excellent putter on bentgrass greens, which we will see again this week at Memorial.
4602	4602	3	4	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World’s No. 1 Dustin Johnson, coming off a career best showing at TPC Sawgrass is playing for the third consecutive week. He’s joined by fellow Top 10ers Jason Day (4), Sergio Garcia (5), and Jordan Spieth (6).
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
4729	4729	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I cannot remember the last time I saw his price this low, along with his betting odds at 16/1, which seem long for a field of this strength. Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
13317	13317	67	68	target: Si Woo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly as I mentioned earlier in the piece it may pay to look at a players past performance at the OHL Mayakoba as this is the other Greg Norman designed course played on the PGA Tour. Finally similarities have been drawn between the Oaks Course and Pete Dye design courses due to the run off areas around the greens and one thing we can’t do is doubt Si Woo’s liking for a Pete Dye design! It is these last three pointers that clinched it for me to roll the dice with Si Woo again this week and I am hoping he can add his name to the list of players who have memorably bounced back from heartbreak one week to win the next.
