7625	7625	24	24	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively. They’re historically pricey while DJ is around his average; that should affect ownership, and indeed DJ is projected for the most ownership this week at 26-30 percent in our Models.
12781	12781	11	12	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charl Schwartzel: 30th Houston/47th Bay Hill/24th Doral/14th PGA National/8th Abu Dhabi. Phil Mickelson: 35th Houston/30th Bay Hill/14th Doral/24th TPC Scottsdale. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their wave and winning score since 2010.
3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3858	3858	14	15	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like him in cash or GPP formats on DraftKings this week. Value Plays  Matthew Fitzpatrick $8,300 – FitzMagic is in wonderful form having not missed a cut since January. He’s a total ball striker with accuracy off the tee being his specialty.
13214	13214	12	12	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below are the golfers who fit it this week. Casey  Kuchar  Harman  Cook  Glover  Landry  The top three aren’t a surprise, but the bottom three may test the trend! Cook, Glover, and especially Landry, don’t have the sharpest form coming into this week.
4151	4151	35	35	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior. While he struggles with the flatstick, Grace is an adept approach player, placing 13th on Tour in strokes gained: approach last year. Middling  Ian Poulter: $7,900  Poults has never needed it more.
10406	10406	12	13	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus. Nine Bridges: Justin Thomas; EW Places: Leishman, Cam Smith, Whee Kim, Brown, Lahiri, List, Lovemark. TPC Summerlin: Patrick Cantlay; EW Places: Whee Kim, Cejka, Hadley, Kizzire, Hossler, Hoge Bradley, DeChambeau.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
5487	5487	3	4	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
5464	5464	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  See above. You have to drop down to Kevin Chappell at $8,800 for a player approaching what Mickelson brings to the table. He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints.
10205	10205	13	14	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, it may be enough to keep other owners away. -- Zach Turcotte  Tiger Woods  It is difficult to target a golfer making his first competitive start with FedEx Cup points on the line since this event last year, but in this case, the golfer is Tiger Woods. There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event.
5170	5170	21	22	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When a course requires the top ball strikers, you fit Hideki into your lineups. Also Consider: Byeong Hun An, Jon Rahm, Rickie Fowler, Marc Leishman, Emiliano Grillo  Sleepers  Here is a list of GPP plays, or sleepers if you will, that could be lower owned and have some upside to them. You do not need much ownership on these players to be overweight the field.
3959	3959	13	14	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s. Koepka admitted he lost his game for a while this season but the 27-year-old came back to form by making the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play.
7173	7173	30	31	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course was last played in 2008 when Padraig Harrington took home the Claret Jug. In that year a few current players finished high up on the leaderboard; Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey all finished within the top 10. All three of these players share a few traits within their games; they are all accurate off of the tee and great tee-to-green.
9279	9279	26	26	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
5603	5603	47	48	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The cost per session was $125, albeit free for me, and worth every penny for those who glided four rounds with the most mechanically gifted swinger of the golf club maybe ever. I don't know when it hit me Sunday, but at some point I realized, damn, Dustin Johnson is kind of built to win U.S. Opens.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
231	231	13	14	target: J Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five for Pebble Beach: C Smith 125/1, S Cink 150/1, M Thompson 175/1, J Hahn 200/1, G Owen 200/1. 365 have nice top20 prices for latter four
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
9466	9466	13	14	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if there’s one thing yours truly loves to see, it’s consistency, and Kyle Stanley was an absolute monster in that department, carding an average of 1.259 SG:T2G per round despite playing a very busy 29 event schedule. Incidentally, in those 29 events, Stanley also posted a very impressive twelve top-25 finishes to go with five top-tens and a win at the brutal Quicken Loans National at TPC Potomac. The other thing I love in my DFS golfers is when they are consistently bad at one particular thing, just like Swafford with his scrambling last year.
7837	7837	28	28	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS. Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign.
8978	8978	2	3	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 125/1 Paddy Power The competition is less fierce than a normal PGA Tour event and his ball-striking should out him in contention. He might excel in the early part of the season away from the spotlight.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
1252	1252	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes (7.4k) - not accurate off the tee yet has 33/6/2/23 L4 here. (DA was under 45% each time). Wish his for… https://t.co/MjIQAYaJcI
13257	13257	15	15	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have gamer's remorse, well, there you go. Just as he was last year, Donald is my pick. If you don't like it, ask yourself if you're stereotyping for whatever motivation.
5005	5005	19	19	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take advantage of the price gift DK is giving you this week and lock him in your lineups. Emiliano Grillo $7,800 – Grillo is a guy that can be hard to peg week to week, but coming off an 11th place finish in his last start, we see him trending up and want to be on him while the price is right. Grillo also checks the box for us on approach, shot proximity to the hole which will be key this week as Colonial Country Club has some of the smallest greens you will see all year on tour.
4057	4057	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
73	73	25	26	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH OUT!!!! 2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Ryan Moore $10,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Brandt Snedeker $9,800  Kevin Na $9,100  2016 John Deere Classic DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Rafa Cabrera-Bello $8,900  William McGirt $8,700  Scott Piercy $8,500  Kevin Kisner $8,300  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Ben Martin $8,000  Jason Dufner $7,900  Billy Horschel $7,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Luke Donald $7,000  Camilo Villegas $6,400  Roberto Castro $6,000  Seung-Yul Noh $5,600  Rickie Fowler $11,700  Webb Simpson $10,200  Russell Henley $9,000  JB Holmes $8,100  Shane Lowry $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

7360	7360	12	12	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's the same game plan I had last time we were here." Stenson didn't have his best stuff at the Scottish Open last week but he closed with a 68 for T26 and his best Open results have come when he's warmed up on the links in Scotland. He may also have noted that Padraig Harrington came to Royal Birkdale as the defending champion in 2008 and retained the Claret Jug.
9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
6224	6224	41	41	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A good putting week and he'll be very dangerous on a course like this. I don't want to be backing anyone at short prices this week given the lack of course form so therefore I'm happy to take the 50/1 about Bradley rather than the short odds for Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. Bill Haas and Brendan Steele have good credentials but between them they have a win apiece since 2013 so I'm not overly enthused about either at 25/1.
4158	4158	11	11	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year.
12386	12386	35	35	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's the ultimate wild card because you're likely going to burn him at some point, but you still wouldn't miss him if you didn't. Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format.
9495	9495	33	34	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lower down, Hideki Matsuyama is a near lock at under $10K given his course history, and Brooks Koepka should garner heavy consideration at $9,400, too. Some potential value plays include Ryan Armour ($6,200), Bryson DeChambeau ($7,000), Brendan Steele ($7,400) and Cam Smith ($7,600). Tournaments: Given that Fowler has the worst course history of the top-three golfers, he might be the best target in tournaments ownership-wise.
335	335	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very minimal research but on top of DJ and Spieth I really like JT this week. Vegas And Haas for cheap. Woody Phil and Reed too.
4674	4674	2	3	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			GPP ONLY. Nick Taylor $6,900  Welp, there ya go. The top 17 (no idea how I keep landing on that number of picks every week) for this week if playing on DraftKings.
3125	3125	9	9	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In reality, that just doesn't happen. In-Play Tactics  Given Holmes was the first winner on the PGA Tour to come from six back with a round to go since Matt Jones had done so in this event 12 months earlier, it's clearly possible to win from some way off the pace but Jim Herman won from the front last year and that felt like normal service had resumed. Both the 2014 and 2015 results were unique in their own way.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
11171	11171	4	4	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $12100 – JT has two missed cuts and a third-place finish at PGA National, but don’t let his up-and-down results turn you away from one of the best in the field. Thomas has morphed into a better player each year and his maturity should land him much closer to another top-5 than a missed cut this week. Sergio Garcia, $11900 – Making his first PGA Tour start on U.S. soil this year, Sergio should have plenty of confidence on a venue where he has notched three top-15s in his last four trips.
8878	8878	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically, Finau is dominating off of the tee recently, a quick glance at our VIP Research Station shows he is right at the top of the field in this regard. On a course with plenty of scoring opportunities, I like Finau’s chances this week. Keegan Bradley – Cash – DK: $9300  Bradley made ten straight cuts to finish the season.
5361	5361	11	11	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year. Brooks Koepka, $10100 – Finishing second, third, and 19th in three Memphis starts is a good track record for anyone, let alone the fourth-highest ranked player in the field. Koepka is plenty long and posted five top-16 finishes over his last seven starts.
7955	7955	209	210	target: Tony Finau, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 PGA Championship Picks: Show Index  3:23 Course  7:46 Key Stats  9:09 Field/Odds Breakdown  37:25 Bets & Picks  39:08 One and Done  There’s $1,000,000 up for grabs at PGA Championship on DraftKings, so Sign Up for a DraftKings Account Today and get a FREE $10!!! 2017 PGA Championship Details  Purse: $10.25M  FedEx Cup Points: 600  Defending Champion: Jimmy Walker  Course: Quail Hollow  Yardage: 7,600  Par: 71  2017 PGA Championship Key Stats  Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee  Driving Distance  Par 4 Performance 450-500 Yards  Strokes Gained: Approach  Ball Striking  2017 PGA Championship Picks: One And Done  Team Mayo:$6,523,697  2017 PGA Championship Pick: Adam Scott  2017 Golfers Used: Jimmy Walker, Jamie Lovemark, Martin Laird, Jon Rahm, Sean O’Hair, Dustin Johnson, Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland, Henrik Stenson, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton, Branden Grace, Lucas Glover, Martin Kaymer, Patrick Reed, Nick Taylor, Rickie Fowler, Kyle Stanley, Shane Lowry, Brendan Steele, David Hearn, Harris English, Kelly Kraft, Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Daniel Berger  Team Stewart: $2,231,161  2017 PGA Championship Pick: Brooks Koepka  2017 Golfers Used: Pat Perez, Luke List, Gary Woodland, Harris English, JB Holmes, Paul Casey, Daniel Berger, Martin Kaymer, Wes Bryan, Francesco Molinari, Thomas Pieters, Charley Hoffman, Jordan Spieth, William McGirt, Brendan Steele, Jon Rahm, Ryan Moore, Tony Finau, Marc Leishman, Patrick Cantlay, Peter Uihlien, Branden Grace, Bubba Watson, Danny Lee, David Lingmerth, Curtis Luck, Andy Sullivan, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele  Mayo’s 2017 PGA Championship Picks: Value Bets  Outright Winner (2x Units)  Jon Rahm +2500  Outright Winner (Full Units)  Adam Scott +4000  Outright Winner (3/4 Units)  Daniel Berger +6600  Outright Winner (1/2 Units)  JB Holmes +9000  Tony Finau +10000  Louis Oosthuizen +11000  Kyle Stanley +15000  Outright Winner (1/4 Units; e/w)  Jamie Lovemark +20000  James Hahn +22500  Outright Winner (1/8 Units; e/w)  Bud Cauley +25000  Andrew Johnson +30000  First Round Leader (T5 Each Way)  Jimmy Walker +9000  Louis Oosthuizen +9000  Jamie Lovemark +11000  Byeong-Hun An +12500  Keegan Bradley +12500  James Hahn +12500  Patrick Rodgers +1500  Jason Kokrak +17500  Luke List +17500  Scott Brown +20000  Jonas Blixt +20000  Matt Dobyns +40000  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

682	682	6	6	target: Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			as you know, I'm a big Gribble guy. and he's from TEXAS. more later on this. https://t.co/keg5WaDjOx
2290	2290	11	11	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the wonky pricing, entire cash game lineups are becoming chalk. Rose will be in it on Sunday. Jim Furyk – $6,700  Jim Furyk gave all those who rostered him a heavy dose of pars last week, managing to only score 30 DraftKings points in three rounds before getting MDF’d.

10594	10594	80	81	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley. Plus, Ian Poulter, Steve Stricker, and Ryan Moore will be making their 2018 PGA debuts.
6703	6703	6	6	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy early and often! VALUE  Nick Taylor ($7,600) – Feeling generous, are we DK? Taylor has been red hot lately, and the only reason he isn’t priced even higher than this is because his putter tends to let him down from time to time.
4634	4634	178	178	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
7817	7817	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He hasn’t had a signature win since The Players a few years ago, and I think this could be spot where he breaks through on the WGC stage. Jason Day (DK: $9,400, FD: $8,800)  This is purely a gut call and could blow up in my face, but I’ll be going heavy on Day in GPPs. I have to believe that his ownership will be microscopic and in an 76-man field, we’ll need to take some shots on low owned guys who can legitimately win the event.
6153	6153	28	29	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			14 in the Power Rankings), Harris English (Sleeper) and Chez Reavie (Draw in the Fantasy Insider). That you've come this far without a mention of two-time Travelers champion Bubba Watson says all that you need to know. Because of an inconsistent 2017 perhaps due to the change in his ball, he sets up as an ironic contrarian at the tournament where he's the all-time earnings leader, but only if you're way back in the pack.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
10967	10967	17	17	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still, he missed the cut. Coming into Riviera off a missed cut and in questionable form makes Scott a decent GPP play this week. Since we know most golfers will be playing from the rough this week, I peeked at guys who make birdies from the rough.
12784	12784	29	30	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think this week signifies his best chance of winning a Major and, if he doesn't, a top-8 finish is by no means out of the question. Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course.
797	797	5	6	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton Kizzire - $8,500  4. Webb Simpson - $7,800  5. Nick Watney - $7,500  6.
12699	12699	0	1	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9300): Although he fell back in the pack on Sunday in his Masters debut last year, Rahm was very impressive through 54 holes at Augusta, sitting at even par through 54 in what was a very tough week for scoring. For a first-timer, Rahm flashed all the tools necessary to succeed in the years to come, and this year he should sport an even better finish. Since the start of 2018, the feisty Spaniard has amassed four top-25s – including a win at CareerBuilder and a runner-up in the Tournament of Champions – while missing zero cuts in seven events.
3028	3028	24	25	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
7603	7603	9	10	target: Danny Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Danny Lee – $8,000  Danny Lee has WD from the John Deere Classic. These were words most of the DFS Golf community dreaded to see two weeks ago.
1433	1433	7	7	target: Kelly 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How on earth was course specialist Jerry Kelly matched at [300.0] on the exchange? Winner in 2002, Kelly has made the top-20 on 11 of 17 renewals this century, including top-nines in the last three. He's since come down to around [200.0] but still looks massively overpriced.
359	359	48	49	target: Phil Mickelson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi / Emiliano Grillo; 11) Colt Knost / John Huh / Spencer Levin; 14) Kevin Streelman; 15) Jon Curran; 16) Scott Brown / Kevin Na / Kevin Kisner; 19) Russell Knox; 20) Chad Campbell.

1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
2862	2862	18	19	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you want to go contrarian, Graeme McDowell is the guy in this group. Hideki Matsyuama, Justin Rose, Paul Casey, & Kevin Kisner – Don’t worry about Hideki’s recent struggles, his ball striking and short game are still elite, which is necessary at Bay Hill… Rose has four Top 15s in his last five trips to Orlando along with three Top 5 finishes in his past five overall. As a bonus, he’s second in the field from the key Par 3 Range, trailing only Martin Kaymer… Casey has just been playing too well to not pop at some point.
1688	1688	20	20	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
3633	3633	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price suckered me in. Paul Casey 40% – Speaking of way too cheap. Here we have Paul Casey.
6001	6001	7	8	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			COMING IN HOT : RECENT FORM  1. Paul Casey, $9,700  I highlighted Casey in the “Coming in Hot” portion of this article last week and he stayed scorching early in the U.S. Open with a 66-71 Thursday-Friday. A 75-74 weekend left him with a 26th-place finish, but it’s still 11 straight made cuts for the Englishman.
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
1647	1647	33	34	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Dustin Johnson ($11.1m); 2: Jason Day ($11.4m); 3: Jimmy Walker ($9.4m); 4: Brandt Snedeker ($9.5m); 5: Phil Mickelson ($10.0m); 6: Charles Howell III ($7.3m); 7: Gary Woodland ($8.6m); 8: Justin Rose ($10.2m); 9: Rickie Fowler ($9.7m); 10: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.2m). Predictor Positives : Dustin Johnson is cheaper than both Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama this week and I would take him in this 2017 renewal.
8610	8610	70	71	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This section is going to detail a few of the golfers who have the best fantasy value compared to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Marc Leishman 66-1 $6,900 Tony Finau 7,100 and 80-1  Russell Knox $7,100 and 125-1  Emiliano Grillo $6,900 and 175-1 Adam Scott 34-1 $7,900 Gary Woodland $8,000 and 100-1  Webb Simpson $8,200 and 55-1  Charley Hoffman $8,300 and 50-1  Course Horses  Phil Mickelson loves being aggressive, and this course has suited him well in the past. Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and also has a 10th and fourth in his past six visits.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
5639	5639	0	1	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8,800): Scott has been up and down ever since the Masters but his recent finish at the FedEx St. Jude suggests a man whose long game might be finally peaking. Scott was top five in SG: approaches and tee to green in Memphis and has actually been putting better than his career averages recently too. For DFS, he’s well under priced at just $8,800 and probably a better play from a pure value perspective than anyone in the 9k range.
7192	7192	0	1	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia may have a Green Jacket in his closet, but this is the major championship he’s been the best at over his career. Dating back to 2005, Garcia has seven finishes of ninth or better at the Open, including a heartbreaking playoff loss to Paddy Harrington in 2007. Marc Leishman is a bit of a late bloomer to links golf, but his record over the past few Opens is worth noting.
12041	12041	60	61	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Strategy Tips for this week (based on 60k standard salary cap)    Well-rounded players who are solid off the tee with great irons excel at Bay Hill, but there’s also a chance a few elite putters find themselves in contention as well. As such, focus your efforts on securing great ball strikers who have shown flashes of good putting recently (*cough* Jason Day - Justin Rose - Tiger Woods *cough*) and blend in others who have proven history at the King’s place. The eventual winner is going to need to drive it well and score on the par-5s to have any chance, so make sure you fill your lineup with players who have a good chance of doing just that.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
2036	2036	20	21	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the weather is truly as bad as it looks, I also like Brandt to contend more than others. Tom:  Justin Rose $9,200 – Rosey has teed it up twice in the States in 2017, and twice finished in the top 5. When players of his caliber do this, it is best to just ride the hot hand.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
12699	12699	1	1	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9300): Although he fell back in the pack on Sunday in his Masters debut last year, Rahm was very impressive through 54 holes at Augusta, sitting at even par through 54 in what was a very tough week for scoring. For a first-timer, Rahm flashed all the tools necessary to succeed in the years to come, and this year he should sport an even better finish. Since the start of 2018, the feisty Spaniard has amassed four top-25s – including a win at CareerBuilder and a runner-up in the Tournament of Champions – while missing zero cuts in seven events.
12032	12032	41	42	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Though Arnold isn’t physically present, his legend lives on in what should be another fantastic close to the Florida Swing. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Marc Leishman  2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Matt Every  2014 – Matt Every  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Martin Laird  2010 – Ernie Els  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Tiger Woods    Key Stats to Winning this Week    • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green  • Strokes Gained Putting  • Par-5 Scoring    Champion’s Profile    As a longer track with some penalizing rough, it’s a must for players to drive the ball well, both long and straight. The length becomes a nice advantage on the reachable par-5 holes and longer par-4s that prove demanding over four rounds.
93	93	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sleeper of the Week  Our weekly pick for you is one that you may not expect. Graham DeLaet: He scored a top 5 here in 2012 and was 20th in the Olympics a few weeks ago. He also posted a top 10 in July, so he is close.
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
1288	1288	13	13	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open picks: Winner: TIGER! Just kidding... Leishman Top 10: Finau, Howell, Steele DK Sleepers: L… https://t.co/JMY4XPGdcM

6104	6104	65	66	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For tournaments, I will be looking to build around a core the same core for the most part but also using some contrarian plays that could be lower owned with similar upside. The Course  TPC River Highlands - Cromwell, CT  Par 70 - 6,841 Yards  Greens - Bentgrass  **Click to Enlarge**  Past Five Winners  2016 - Russell Knox (-14)  - Russell Knox (-14) 2015 - Bubba Watson (-16)  - Bubba Watson (-16) 2014 - Kevin Streelman (-15)  - Kevin Streelman (-15) 2013 - Ken Duke (-12)  - Ken Duke (-12) 2012 - Marc Leishman (-14)  The Stats & Fantasy Approach  My Key Stats:  Strokes Gained: Off the Tee + Approach  Par 4 Scoring Average  Greens in Regulation from 100-150 Yards  Birdie or Better %  Other Stats I am looking at - Bogey Avoidance, Strokes Gained Putting  I will also be factoring in players who do well on Par 70 courses and Pete Dye designed courses.

826	826	12	12	target: GAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
2851	2851	1	2	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Bill Haas - Haas was outclassed in Mexico, but he's otherwise been great this season. This is a good track for him, and he should have won here last year.
9004	9004	11	12	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Purse: $7 million; $1.26 million (winner); 500 FEC points. Defending Champion: Justin Thomas defended his championship as he defeated Hideki Matsuyama by three shots. Notes: 78 players; 72 holes (no cut).
8090	8090	19	20	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My shortlist was massive this week although very few really struck me as potential winners. Of those that did, Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel were the most notable within our price range. Both have majors pedigree, excellent Florida records and are long off the tee.
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
5576	5576	10	10	target: Fowler’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite. A missed cut at the FedEx St Jude Classic aside – more on that shortly – Fowler might just have the most complete profile currently and is well capable of putting himself in position for victory once more. His latest opportunity to land himself a major came at the Masters in April and although perfectly poised after three rounds, it didn’t happen for the Californian as he drifted away to a T11 with a closing 76.
4530	4530	2	2	target: Johnson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That said, Johnson’s heavy 12.5 percent odds to win are currently the best in the field. Newlywed Swag  Unlike Johnson, the newly-married Rory McIlroy has thrived in recent trips to TPC Sawgrass. In fact, McIlroy’s 68.2 Course Adjusted Round Score is the fifth-best score among golfers who have made more than one start at this course.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
9716	9716	1	1	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week. Thomas for a second-straight week will serve as defending champion, but don’t let last week’s performance scare you away. Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week.
8010	8010	27	27	target: Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That first round was a tough one for him in his debut in the Wells Fargo, but he played well throughout the rest of the week. Like Holmes, Finau has played pretty well of late. He was fifth in the RBC Canadian Open and seventh in the Greenbrier Classic.
4788	4788	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All those sub-par rounds have translated into T10 on debut in 2010 and T12 last year. I always like Finau on a windy track and that's the deal this week. He won the Puerto Rico Open last year in really blustery conditions and fired a 65 in round two of the Texas Open when it blew over 20mph.
6885	6885	39	40	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They're getting long in the tooth now and Zach, in-particular, is struggling form wise but I thought they were worth small savers at around [30.0] and I also like the defending champ and this year's Heritage winner, Wesley Bryan. Ryan Moore hasn't played for five weeks because of a strained tendon in his left shoulder so there's a danger he's rushing back to make his defence. That's the only reason I can see for his price of [42.0] but if you flip that on its head, maybe he's waited to get back in A1 condition to put up a bold defence on a course he clearly loves?
816	816	19	20	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick to Click: DJ was awful last week; I’ll do much better this week. Winners picked this year: 1  Brooks Koepka – $10,700 Out of alt he guys priced 10k and above, he’s the only one I’d play at a high clip. Chris Kirk is playing very well right now, but I think Koepka is going to win, and soon, and it might be in Vegas this week.
11370	11370	40	41	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a plethora of players vying for a place in the six-man line-up for the official European Tour fantasy game and the addition of some top Americans, who are now eligible, adds to the difficulty for gamers. Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood will surely be a staple of most line-ups given their exploits here last year while Dutchman Joost Luiten could be a big-value outsider to cause a few waves. One To Swerve  Tyrrell Hatton’s T10 last year may have been based on the fact he was in fantastic form rather than loved the course.
3652	3652	17	17	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have to take the chalk in this group (Kuchar/Snedeker/Furyk), Kuch is the best bet. Tyrrell Hatton & Jason Dufner – As with Grace last year, the missed cut for Hatton at Augusta may actually work in his favor. Expectations have been lowered and he got the extra two days of downtime.
1099	1099	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: B Gay 125/1, B Stuard 125/1, W Kim 250/1, C Campbell 250/1, M Hoffmann 250/1, C Conners 300/1
8222	8222	29	29	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They've changed number five which was an awkward tee-shot which required a draw which I'm glad I don't have to play anymore." With less hype surrounding him this week, Rahm could really fly. Last four events: 28-44-1-10  Quail Hollow record: Debut  US PGA record: Debut  Last 10 majors: 44-MC-27-59-23  Last 50 starts - Win: 6%, Top 5: 31%, Top 10: 40%      Brooks Koepka    If Spieth has been king of the majors in the last few seasons, Koepka has probably been prince.
578	578	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will. He’s long enough to suit this course and with 9 consecutive tournaments of being under par, Reed has the scoring ability to win everything come Sunday.
818	818	13	13	target: Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like that form to continue this week. o P/PR= 88  • Cody Gribble – $8.400 Fresh of his first PGA Tour victory, Gribble’s masterful Sunday propelled him to full tour status for the next 2 years. I’m sure that will have a great effect on him, and I expect to see him around a lot this year.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
11523	11523	17	18	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The second WGC of the 2017-18 season also presents career-changing potential for non-members. In last year's edition, Tommy Fleetwood, Ross Fisher, Thomas Pieters and Tyrrell Hatton recorded top 10s in Mexico City. Each would go on to total enough non-member FedExCup points to secure fully exempt status this season.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
1031	1031	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
11902	11902	25	26	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st). 2012, Tiger Woods (-13). 295 yards (11th), 64.3% fairways (29th), 79.2% greens in regulation (1st), 36'4" proximity to hole (20th), 60.0% scrambling (10th), 1.84 putts per GIR (52nd).
11649	11649	39	39	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace lost strokes on his approaches in Mexico for the first time all season, yet he continued his season-long trend of saving pars from missed GIRs. If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament.
1142	1142	5	6	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka - $8,900  3. Rickie Fowler - $7,900  4. Russell Knox - $7,400  5.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
7254	7254	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
6500	6500	17	19	target: Tyrone Van Aswegen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			During his streak, he's up nearly six percentage points and slots a season-best T44 in the stat. Tyrone Van Aswegen … No golfer puts four rounds together regularly, but the absence of it entirely is the ironic constant among rank-and-filers. When expectations need to remain high to sustain a livelihood at this level, any spark can be monumental, not to mention lucrative.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
6119	6119	23	24	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(gpp)  Anirban Lahiri ($7,500) – Par 4 scoring machine when he’s on and he definitely has the ability to come out hot. (gpp)  Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Had a MC last week but I’m not worried. He fits this course and has been solid all season.
3178	3178	25	25	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2008, it was Johnson Wagner and his local connections which upset the apple cart and while Paul Casey, Anthony Kim, Hunter Mahan and Phil Mickelson represent more obvious champions, it's pretty clear that this event has been somewhat hard to predict. Of those mentioned, Stenson and Mickelson look sure to play well and it was interesting to note the latter's comments in last week's Match Play, which convince me that he's worth having on-side despite Houston's in-built volatility. When asked about Augusta, Mickelson was keen to stress that he has another event to play first and, considering how confident he's become in his game of late, he expects to contend.
11105	11105	41	42	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Russell Knox; 2) Tommy Fleetwood; 3) Tyrrell Hatton; 4) Billy Horschel / Alex Noren; 6) Keegan Bradley / Sergio Garcia / Martin Kaymer; 9) Dylan Frittelli / Scott Piercy; 11) Peter Uihlein; 12) John Peterson / Justin Thomas; 14) Gary Woodland; 15) Kevin Kisner / Adam Scott; 17) J.J. Henry / Patton Kizzire; 19) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Chesson Hadley / Hudson Swafford. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Jason Dufner; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Tiger Woods; 5) Tyrrell Hatton; 6) Alex Noren; 7) Wesley Bryan; 8) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Rickie Fowler / Tommy Fleetwood / Sergio Garcia; 12) Padraig Harrington; 13) Austin Cook; 14) David Lingmerth / Bernd Wiesberger; 17) Brian Gay / Patton Kizzire; 19) Daniel Berger / Louis Oosthuizen / Ollie Schniederjans. Winners & Prices : 2017: Fowler 16/1 ; 2016: Scott 20/1 ; 2015: Harrington 400/1 ; 2014: Henley 300/1 ; 2013: Thompson 300/1 ; 2012: McIlroy 9/1 ; 2011: Sabbatini 80/1 ; 2010: Villegas 30/1 ; Average: 85/1.
10314	10314	29	30	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Temperatures in La Jolla will be mild for the first two rounds with no precipitation in the forecast, so don’t expect a morning/afternoon tee-time advantage. Past Champions    2017 - Jon Rahm  2016 - Brandt Snedeker  2015 - Jason Day  2014 - Scott Stallings  2013 - Tiger Woods  2012 - Brandt Snedeker  2011 - Bubba Watson  2010 - Ben Crane    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Jon Rahm - $18,000    After notching a second victory in his last three starts at last week’s CareerBuilder Challenge, Rahm is the betting favorite once again as he looks to defend his title at Torrey Pines. The Spaniard even has a chance to overtake Dustin Johnson’s No.
2764	2764	17	18	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I expect him to break out very soon and contend for his first Tour title. DraftKings bargain: Scott Brown ($6,700). I don’t think you’ll have to go too deep this week considering the strength of field, but if you want Justin Thomas or Henrik Stenson then Brown is a good option.

6579	6579	30	30	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The scrubs in these tournaments are trash, and the upside a top tiered golfer offers isn’t much higher than someone in the $9K range. That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls.
12168	12168	3	4	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fervor that Tiger Woods manufactured at last week's Valspar Championship was all the most skeptical needed to close the chapter on any residual doubt in his latest return to competition. His performance aligned with candor, honesty, adjusted expectations and the glint of his old and still familiar fire. It reminded us of all that once was good and that he could be again.

11715	11715	14	15	target: Sam Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, instead, I'll jump down to the three-figure prices and try a punt on Sam Saunders at 125/1. Asked recently what his grandfather, the great Arnold Palmer, might say about his recent play, Saunders replied, "Something like, it's about time you won." He'd made a similar point himself at the start of the year.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
2729	2729	105	106	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Kevin Streelman; 2) Ross Fisher; 3) Keegan Bradley; 4) Henrik Stenson; 5) Charles Howell III / Sergio Garcia; 7) Russell Knox / Justin Rose; 9) Jordan Spieth; 10) Gary Woodland; 11) Paul Casey; 12) Adam Hadwin / Adam Scott; 14) Tony Finau / Hudson Swafford; 16) Lucas Glover / Peter Uihlein; 18) Byeong-Hun An / Billy Horschel; 20) Branden Grace.

Winners & Prices : 2017: Hadwin 125/1 ; 2016: Schwartzel 33/1 ; 2015: Spieth 16/1 ; 2014: Senden 125/1 ; 2013: Streelman 200/1 ; 2012: Donald 11/1 ; 2011: Woodland 100/1 ; 2010: Furyk 30/1 ; Average: 80/1.
801	801	6	6	target: CASEY, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WellsFargoChampionship win: DJ in mix: RAHM, CASEY, webb, BRYAN, berger 💣: poston, gay 5/1 is your only hope. 💰e… https://t.co/OzxPWUtlnc
6545	6545	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries. Cink is one of the best in the field in SG: Approach. He’ll be wildly popular we suspect in DraftKings GPPs, but it’s too great of a bargain to pass up.
186	186	3	3	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SonyOpen Picks Luau Jimmy 22-1 Paul Casey 28-1 Russell Knox 40-1 Daniel 🍔 40-1 Scott Piercy 40-1 Chris Kirk 50-1 Harris English 60-1
5340	5340	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On to the Picks! Next Day Air  Brooks Koepka $11,500 – He finished second here last year, 3rd the year before and 19th in 2014. I watched him all last week on Shot Tracker and his biggest issue seemed to be making putts.
2472	2472	18	18	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be in for some positive regression this week. When looking at our European Tour comp courses, Garcia fits. He’s especially fond of Crans Sur Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters.
11040	11040	13	13	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At his worst, he’s a grinder who can get you to the weekend. Keegan Bradley  If you have a pacemaker, please, for your own safety, do not roster Keegan. The stress will have you in the emergency room.
8582	8582	42	43	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are firm and you have a lot of options for shots around the greens." Weather Forecast    TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting at 19:00 on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Patrick Reed -9  2015 - Jason Day -19  2014 - Hunter Mahan -14  2013 - Adam Scott -11  2012 - Nick Watney -10      What Will it Take to Win the Northern Trust? It's never easy when a new venue is used but it sounds like the fairways are generous enough so Driving Accuracy is probably a stat to ignore.
6101	6101	8	9	target: Lucas Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At $6,500 why not play the hot hand? Lucas Glover – $6,600 and a strong cut maker. When he is in sync he pushes top 10/25 territory.
12647	12647	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the GOLF GODS exist, they’ll be worth a couple of shots this week. Brandt Snedeker: He’s never made the cut but his last trip was 2013. He was one shot out of the lead at Valspar before fading with 78.
11	11	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
293	293	77	78	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			As the 146th Open gets underway this week in England, 156 hopefuls will compete for the right to be called Champion Golfer of the Year, and another chapter in the compelling and unpredictable history of this oldest major in golf will be written. Henrik Stenson aims to become the first player to successfully defend The Open title since Padraig Harrington did it in 2007 and 2008, and is joined by a marquee class of major champions including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott. Over the past decade, The Open has favored crafty veterans over young upstarts, with eight of the last 10 Open winners checking in at ages 33 or older.
1428	1428	8	8	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ThePME @fantasynational I see a lot of Captain Kirk 😎
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
12285	12285	101	102	target: Harris English. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi; 9) Fabian Gomez; 10) Richy Werenski; 11) Brice Garnett / Graeme McDowell / Rory Sabbatini; 14) Tim Herron; 15) Ben Crane; 16) Scott Piercy; 17) Alex Cejka / Joel Dahmen / Tyler Duncan; 20) Davis Love III. Greens in Regulation : 1) Scott Piercy; 2) Sam Ryder; 3) Emiliano Grillo; 4) Corey Conners; 5) J.J.

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Ricky Barnes; 2) Emiliano Grillo; 3) Lanto Griffin; 4) Andres Romero; 5) Greg Chalmers / Michael Kim; 7) Scott Piercy; 8) David Lingmerth; 9) Troy Merritt; 10) Harris English / Trey Mullinax; 12) Jim Furyk / Tom Lovelady; 14) Fabian Gomez / Mike Weir; 16) Martin Flores / Ethan Tracy; 18) Robert Garrigus / Ricky Werenski; 20) Johnson Wagner.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.

My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Justin Rose - $9,600 Jon Rahm - $9,000 Sergio Garcia - $8,500 Jason Dufner - $8,100 Rafa Cabrera-Bello - $7,400 Louis Oosthuizen - $7,200  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
1018	1018	2	3	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Sleeper: Luke List.
13156	13156	63	63	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey won the Valspar Championship last month, his first main Tour victory since 2014, and we all know about Phil Mickelson's 5 year drought ending with a cracking victory at the WGC-Mexico Championship the week before Casey's victory. So in Simpson we have a 4-time PGA Tour winner who hasn't won since October 2013. Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one.
7688	7688	2	3	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
11875	11875	2	3	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
7838	7838	8	9	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign. It will be interesting to see what Brooks’ ownership will be this week on DK, but I’d venture to guess he’ll be going off as lesser-owned than any of the players above him, making him a perfect gpp target.
815	815	3	3	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5. Strokes Gained Approach to Green – Simpson, Garrigus, Cejka, Taylor, DeLeat  Player Focus: The Shriners  On the Rise: Pretty bad week overall.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
1589	1589	27	29	target: Charles Howell III: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer has always had an erratic streak that has kept him from ascending to the upper echelons, and this was yet another week that exemplifies that tendency. Charles Howell III: Another week, another top 15 finish from CH3. The transition to PXG and recovery from his injury late last season have clearly returned Chalk Howell back to his prominent, consistent form.
1469	1469	25	25	target: Spaun’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 26-year-old punched his ticket to the big league by winning the News Sentinel Open but it’s the style of his victories that I like. Spaun’s winning score in Knoxville was 26-under and his money-list winning season on the PGA Tour Canada was driven by taking apart easy courses. Spaun is 3/6 in cuts made this season but rounds of 65 at the OHL Classic and RSM Classic have hinted at his potential.
5386	5386	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Brooks Koepka  The man has only played the event three times and he's gotten better each year. From T-19 to T-3 to runner-up in 2016.
98	98	28	29	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alex Cejka ($7,000) has withdrawn. 2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Jason Day $12,400  Rory McIlroy $11,600  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Phil Mickelson $9,700  Rickie Fowler $9,300  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Charl Schwartzel $8,500  Jimmy Walker $8,200  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Patrick Rodgers $7,400  2016 The Barclays DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Daniel Berger $6,900  JB Holmes $6,400  Webb Simpson $6,000  Brendan Steele $5,900  Rickie Fowler $9,300  Louis Oosthuizen $9,000  Marc Leishman $7,900  Paul Casey $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

7889	7889	29	30	target: event…Jon Rahm! 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam believes that Torrey Pines is a course that strongly resembles Firestone. By the way, guess who won at Torrey earlier this season their first time playing in the event…Jon Rahm! He’s an incredible ball striker with a caddie on the bag that knows Firestone quite well.
2692	2692	17	17	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finally – and here’s the absurd selection I referred to earlier – I can’t leave out Bryson DeChambeau at 300/1. Among the many small reasons for expecting improvement from DeChambeau is his form here as an amateur, which includes guiding SMU to victory when he was the only player in a good field to break 70 in both rounds at the course. Isolated, that’s nowhere near enough to make a case but DeChambeau caught the eye last time, striking the ball exceptionally well at the extremely difficult PGA National only to find all his work undone by one of the worst putting displays you’ll see.
1373	1373	6	6	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winners for this week. Xander 100/1, Harkins 150/1 and Brazel 140/1. All ew.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
4059	4059	4	4	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, all Cink needs to do is make the cut and score some more points on the weekend. He may not be the sexiest play by any means, but he does rank 31st in SG: Tee to Green, 15th in Par 4 Scoring, 50th in Bogey Avoidance, and 44th in Birdie or Better %. As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
11875	11875	2	2	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
598	598	6	6	target: McGirt, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bets for this week: Knox, 50/1 McGirt, 66/1 Stanley, 80/1 Herman, 150/1 All outright only and to be followed by Top 20 bets.
3253	3253	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la creme  Rickie Fowler: $10,000  Spieth and Stenson will be the most highly owned golfers this week, and not without good reason. Consider fading them for the cheaper Rickie Fowler, who has been on a tepid march lately with a win and a trio of top-20 finishes in his last four starts. He's never missed the cut in Houston and has a pair of top-10 finishes.
8724	8724	19	20	target: (Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens are smaller than average and sectioned into quadrants. Don't discount the fact that the last two winners here (Jason Day and Zach Johnson) are among the tour's best putters. In addition to the aforementioned dexterity with the flatstick, aptitude with the driver (distance preferred!)
2690	2690	18	19	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Robert Garrigus at 150/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) – twice placed at the course and a recent eye-catcher  0.5pt e.w. Bryson DeChambeau at 350/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – point to prove on a course he knows well  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record. After a successful WGC debut in Mexico City, the PGA Tour returns to Florida and something of a deep breath between the top-grade events which have already ensured that 2017 will be a year to remember.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
8577	8577	7	8	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Why not make it back to back? Paul Casey – $9,000  Even though he doesn’t win, Paul Casey loves to get out of the gates hot and wind up inside the top 15 in some way. It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
5781	5781	41	42	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've already used all four so its time to think outside the box. If we open up the criteria to top 20 in both tournament history AND long-term baseline performance we add the following names: Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott, Justin Rose, Jim Furyk, and Charl Schwartzel. I narrowed down to Rose or McIlroy at the Masters and picked wrong there.
11017	11017	4	4	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Tom Hoge $6,600 – Hollywood Hoge is somewhat of a gut call down here in this range.
3274	3274	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At less than $7,000, this is a no-brainer. Michael Kim - $6,400 (Field, 7-2)    Kim hit a rough patch of consecutive missed cuts at Riviera and the Honda, but he's cashed twice since, including a T17 in his last start at Bay Hill. That was his fifth top-25 already this season.
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
7691	7691	9	9	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Get him while he’s feeling good. DraftKings bargain: Bill Haas, $6,900. His record at Firestone is OK, but Haas has been solid for months up until a missed cut at the Open.
10201	10201	28	28	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players whom they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Picks to win  Tony Finau  I've been telling anyone willing to listen that Finau is ready for a breakthrough season that could elevate him to top-10 player in the world status. On a long golf course like Torrey South, where he finished T-4 last year, he should thrive once again.
11365	11365	37	37	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5 couldn’t get much going here last year when shooting 70-72-71-71 to finish T38 but expect a real improvement on that. Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
1309	1309	0	1	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama  Price: $11,000  I wrote last week that I was going to continue to roll with Matsuyama until he cools off, and that's not changing now. Dating back to last fall, here's how the scintillating-hot 24-year-old has fared in his last six events: win, second place to Justin Thomas, win, win, win, second place to Justin Thomas. At some point he's going to finish outside of the Top 2, and there's a good chance that happens at Waialae, where he has three missed cuts (all as an amateur) and a DNF (2015), but he's just playing too well to fade right now.
540	540	4	4	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
13432	13432	51	52	target: Aaron Baddeley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2011 winner, Brendan Steele, was only 28 when he won but disregarding the 2010 and 2103 editions again, the other five winners, when conditions were typical, have all been in their 30s. Inaugural winner, Scott and the 2014 champ, Steven Bowditch, like the course designer, Norman, are both Aussies and Aaron Baddeley and Cameron Smith both finished inside the top-six places last year. Competitors from Down Under are well worth considering.
6275	6275	19	19	target: Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s desperate for a win to secure his spot on the President’s Cup team this Fall. Pivot Plays  David Lingmerth ($8,500) – I like that DK priced Lingmerth this highly because he was bound to be extreme chalk otherwise. I still love him this week, and now we should get him under 15% owned.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
7690	7690	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
10216	10216	45	46	target: Ollie Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However 20th for Birdie Average, 21st for par-5 Birdie or Better Conversion and 28th for All-Round on the PGA Tour season to date, plus 10th position in my 10-week Putting Average tracker, highlights a Torrey Pines specialist you simply can't ignore this week. RESULT: T8  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 50/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places EW, 1/5):  As Barry O'Hanrahan stated in this week's Farmers/Dubai podcast , younger players on the PGA Tour will take note that Jon Rahm won his first PGA Tour title here 12 months ago. That kind of extra motivation could prove the final piece of the jigsaw for talented non-winners this week and Ollie Schniederjans fits that category perfectly.
5621	5621	40	40	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will come into play a lot more than on a regular course, because putting will be neutralized a bit with just getting to greens being a struggle. Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
4087	4087	28	29	target: Rafael Campos 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week we find a standout in a golfer who I have been very intrigued by over the last few weeks. A staple on the Latin American tour Rafael Campos has made over $100,000 in each of the past two seasons in only two events on the PGA Tour. Campos is quickly raising my eyebrows this year however as he continues to make cuts in a string of gutsy performances.

2024	2024	38	39	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the top 5s won’t happen every week, Rose is coming off a T6 finish here last year, and oh by the way, he’s currently leading the PGA in strokes gained tee-to-green, scoring average, and pre-cut scoring average. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – That’s right, I’m hopping back in the Jimmy horse. He might’ve kicked me off twice already this season, but COME ON!
9270	9270	14	15	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan a couple of weeks ago with 20-under. Brooks Koepka loves a low one and he jumps off the page here. With a win (Japan) and a second (WGC-HSBC in China) in his last two starts, he's in cruise control mode and, although his price has been nibbled at, I'm happy to take 9/1.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2769	2769	19	20	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook. Graham DeLaet and Kevin Na. Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook.
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
3483	3483	1	1	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Notably, Mickelson would have to be the first of the last 19 winners to win here a year after missing the cut. That particular trend doesn’t bother me in Mickelson’s respect, with the three-time Green Jacket winner having a clear affinity with this course. That missed cut last year was just his third in 24 appearances at Augusta and as such I believe it was almost an anomaly.
785	785	18	18	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Ian Wilkerson - Wells Fargo - 2ew Simpson 40-1, Rahm 12-1; 1.5ew Casey 22-1; 1ew Swafford 66-1, JT Poston 110-1
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
6513	6513	45	46	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s going to be plenty of bogeys this week, so we need birdies to offset the damages. The top-10 in this field in recent birdie or better percentage are Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson, Tony Finau, Stewart Cink, Kevin Streelman, Grayson Murray, Boo Weekley, James Hahn, Patrick Reed, and Xander Schauffele. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Patrick Reed ($11,200)  This guy is going to win, and he’s going to win soon.
355	355	15	15	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Didn't get to say it on the pod, but don't sleep on PXG Perez or Molinari this week. Sign me up for both!
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
6358	6358	17	17	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have a feeling this is the week, when everyone has finally given up on him. Kyle Stanley – $7,600  Stanley was one of the most popular plays last week on DraftKings and didn’t quite come through with his T57 finish. He is now $1,000 cheaper, which is likely keep his ownership relatively high, but I think the general public will be off of Stanley.
3177	3177	61	62	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the 2013 renewal was a fortnight prior to Augusta, it was still the final port of call for most of the big names in the field and they were to a man outdone by DA Points. In 2008, it was Johnson Wagner and his local connections which upset the apple cart and while Paul Casey, Anthony Kim, Hunter Mahan and Phil Mickelson represent more obvious champions, it's pretty clear that this event has been somewhat hard to predict. Of those mentioned, Stenson and Mickelson look sure to play well and it was interesting to note the latter's comments in last week's Match Play, which convince me that he's worth having on-side despite Houston's in-built volatility.
10436	10436	23	24	target: Harris English, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price. Harris English, $8500 – About halfway down the salary list we see English, and no, this is not a misinterpretation. But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
7589	7589	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not only is there a lack of top talent besides DJ, but the ownership projects on the golfers in the $8K range is down right criminal. Currently, Kevin Chappell has seven tags on FanShareSports, which doesn’t even come close to the golfers priced ahead of him. Chappell arguably a top five golfer in this field, but is will likely come in at under 10% ownership.
1708	1708	21	21	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Three further top-4 finishes at the CareerBuilder, WGC Cadillac and the Wells Fargo were enough to ensure a very solid year. Mickelson will be desperate to get back in the winners’ circle and this is the place for him to do so. He doesn’t stand out statistically but he must be doing something right, looking at his current form.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
7471	7471	14	14	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two of the last three winners here coming off of good Open Championships, Kuchar looks to be in a prime position to take down a weaker field. Charley Hoffman ($10,300): For many of the reasons we have to like Matt Kuchar this week, we also have to like Charley Hoffman. Hoffman played well at the Open, finishing T20, and hasn’t missed the weekend in any of his last nine starts.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
13055	13055	37	38	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another. I can definitely see Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson being part of the picture too so will back both for top 10s at [2.88] and [2.84] respectively. Both can play this course in their sleep and I want to cash in on their combination of experience and impressive recent form.
192	192	27	27	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of others who could play a part in what looks a fascinating week but, at the prices, I like my trio of Reed (50/1), Watson (40/1) and Koepka (30/1). Koepka's recent putting stats are impressive (he's 10th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season) and when you put everything together he's capable of landing the title on his course debut. That should give the Californian the extra incentive to seal it in style and the other way of looking at it is that he may just feel a little more relaxed than some of the others who are the wrong side of the line and chasing.
4803	4803	19	20	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watch (Or Listen) to the show and you’ll get the full skinny. A-List: Graeme McDowell & Marc Leishman  B-List: Paul Casey, Jordan Spieth, Kevin Kisner & William McGirt  C-List: Nick Taylor & Kyle Stanley  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between. You can watch the Pat Mayo Hour every weekday at noon, 3:00pm EST, 8:00pm EST and Midnight on the FNTSY Sports Network Television channel or on your Apple TV, Xbox, Roku or Amazon Fire Stick.
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
4126	4126	8	9	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
334	334	1	2	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Dustin Johnson — D.J. doesn’t have a whole lot to show for himself at TPC Boston, but it’s hard to dislike a guy who has enjoyed the season he’s had.
1061	1061	6	6	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some interesting prices out there. Stewgoat Cink at $6800 will prob bankrupt me
1554	1554	10	10	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Genesis Open - 2ew Chappell 50-1; 4win Johnson 5-1; 1ew Rodgers 125-1, Cantlay 50-1 #GenesisOpen
11363	11363	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
877	877	0	1	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Aaron Wise winner on Web Tour &amp; T10 at TPC Summerlin 12 months ago. Birdie machine who will relish Shriners Open. https://t.co/zLqcf7SOnY
2079	2079	1	2	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Bill Haas -- Haas is a great pick this week, and not just as a horse-for-course. He hasn't finished outside of the top 20 in any start this season.
827	827	7	7	target: HADWIN 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
10185	10185	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Next Best: Back Tony Finau e.w. @ 33/1  Tony Finau's record in the majors - T10, T14, T18 and T27 in just seven played - shows that he likes and can play well in tough conditions. With single digits under par winning three of the last four Farmers Insurance Opens, Finau will get the sort of test he likes and, indeed, Torrey Pines is right up his street in many ways.
13156	13156	41	41	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey won the Valspar Championship last month, his first main Tour victory since 2014, and we all know about Phil Mickelson's 5 year drought ending with a cracking victory at the WGC-Mexico Championship the week before Casey's victory. So in Simpson we have a 4-time PGA Tour winner who hasn't won since October 2013. Players undoubtedly take inspiration from others and with Webb arriving in Hilton Head to play one of his favourite courses, he may well feel that this week could be the one.
735	735	31	32	target: Martin Laird, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Chris Kirk, Nick Watney. 1 - Sang-moon Bae; Jonas Blixt, Jonathan Byrd, Bryson DeChambeau, Luke Donald, Ernie Els, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Billy Hurley III, Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox, Martin Laird, David Lingmerth, Hunter Mahan, Ben Martin, Troy Merritt, Kevin Na, Geoff Ogilvy, Rod Pampling, Ted Potter Jnr, Rory Sabbatini, Vijay Singh, Scott Stallings, Kevin Streelman, Camilo Villegas. Course experience here is an important factor but course debutants shouldn't be overlooked either.
10979	10979	26	27	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not too strict, but definitely helps avoid the golfers that should be reserved for GPPs only:  Sangmoon Bae  Tom Hoge  K.J. Choi  Jonas Blixt  The Specialists  Jason Kokrak  Chez Reavie  Vaughn Taylor  Keegan Bradley  Jimmy Walker  The specialist this week is Jason Kokrak! This masher finished T34-79-MC-T41 in his first four trips to Riviera CC.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
5688	5688	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Worth a GPP team or 2. Matt Kuchar $7,600 – In a tournament that demands mental strength I will want some of the old guy who has been there, done that and doesn’t get too rattled. He also has made the cut (46-12-12-28) the last 4 years.
10129	10129	10	10	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So why not use the CareerBuilder as a tune-up? Beyond Rahm, Brian Harman, on the heel of his recent HOT FIYA run, is the only other member of the world’s top 20 in the CareerBuilder field. Failing to convert another 36-hole lead at the Sony Open, the 3-foot-7 Harman is one of 10 players teeing it up for the third consecutive week to begin the year.
3178	3178	24	25	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2008, it was Johnson Wagner and his local connections which upset the apple cart and while Paul Casey, Anthony Kim, Hunter Mahan and Phil Mickelson represent more obvious champions, it's pretty clear that this event has been somewhat hard to predict. Of those mentioned, Stenson and Mickelson look sure to play well and it was interesting to note the latter's comments in last week's Match Play, which convince me that he's worth having on-side despite Houston's in-built volatility. When asked about Augusta, Mickelson was keen to stress that he has another event to play first and, considering how confident he's become in his game of late, he expects to contend.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
1478	1478	22	23	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$10million+ Salary Players :  Positive: We have 6 players over the $10 million threshold this week which is something new for 2017. Bill Haas takes some beating from a consistency level - he's Mr PGA West - and although the move to a tricky Pete Dye Stadium Course has not helped the Carolinian in any sense, you would be crazy to leave him out of your roster if you want a +$10m spear-head. Zach Johnson is the other that appeals to me on the basis he made 21 birdies and an eagle last week, in what was far and away his best PGA Tour outing since the 2015 Barclays tournament.
6350	6350	1	1	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Taylor – GPP Punt – DK: $6700 FD: $5400  Maybe it’s my Canadian bias coming through but here’s another Canadian that sets up for any par 70 course. For me, Taylor stands out to me in the range of players in the bottom few $100 of salary. Our VIP Spreadsheet shows Taylor gaining strokes to the field Tee-to-Green which is huge anytime you can get a punt play who is doing that.
1005	1005	5	6	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge! If you want to win at DraftKings daily fantasy golf, you have to figure out a way to find six golfers that play all 72 holes and earn roughly 85 points each.
7390	7390	32	33	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To say the least, this course is definitely a bit of a bomber’s paradise. Obviously, this is not to say that shorter hitters won’t be able to jump all over it – Matt Kuchar has destroyed this course the past three times he’s played it – but if you have limited penalty for missing the fairway with short Par 5s and bentgrass greens, that’s pretty much the green light special for your favorite big hitters. Let’s jump into some picks.
10733	10733	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk. Kirk is always a solid putter and relies on his irons, so take some GPP shares of Kirk this week.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
202	202	46	46	target: Koepka's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That should give the Californian the extra incentive to seal it in style and the other way of looking at it is that he may just feel a little more relaxed than some of the others who are the wrong side of the line and chasing. Koepka's recent putting stats are impressive (he's 10th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season) and when you put everything together he's capable of landing the title on his course debut. There are plenty of others who could play a part in what looks a fascinating week but, at the prices, I like my trio of Reed (50/1), Watson (40/1) and Koepka (30/1).
7021	7021	44	45	target: Trey Mullinax, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round.
2929	2929	15	15	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I love those types of golf courses that reward good golf but punish sloppy play." Rose won Memorial in 2010 (his first PGA Tour victory) and you know he'd be a fitting winner and would say all the right things if he were to win the first running of the tournament since Arnie passed. Already on Twitter, he's posted: "The most important follow this week... @APinv #TheKing."
1429	1429	0	1	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak is $6900 on DK and is averaging 69 points over his last 7 events. All in.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10	10	37	38	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And so, I'm taking a guy who doesn't own a great track record here -- just one career top-10 against a bunch of missed cuts -- but has played some inspired golf this year. Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
5462	5462	4	5	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Piercy ($8,500)  9. Phil Mickelson ($10,200)  11. Francesco Molinari ($10,500)  Recommended Lineup  Francesco Molinari: $10,500  Molinari finished second at the BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour in his most recent action.
10239	10239	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes naturally it's a huge ask and Rahm will have plenty on his plate this week, but back-to-back victories are nothing new these days and particularly for a man of his talent. Rahm spent 60 weeks as World Amateur Number 1 and just a look at his amateur history shows back-to-back wins plus victories in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah. Asked last week about his love for California, Rahm answered, "The main reason why I don't live in San Diego or in California is taxes, to be honest.
4601	4601	6	6	target: Spieth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			15 player in the world. Jordan Spieth, Sung Kang, Boo Weekley & Charley Hoffman – Spieth. Meh.
11766	11766	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style. Matt Kuchar – Cash – DK: $8200 FD: $10600  Although last weekend was rough for Matt Kuchar, I have full confidence to go back to him in cash game contests this week.
3325	3325	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a different golfer this year and just looks so confident out there. If you have followed us the past month you can probably tell that we have loved Rickie Fowler this year. And it has paid significant dividends.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
6827	6827	9	10	target: Rory Sabbatini 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's because he's currently 132nd in the FedExCup standings. Rory Sabbatini … He's only 41 years old, but he's been around long enough to have competed in the final edition of the John Deere Classic at Oakwood Country Club as a PGA TOUR rookie in 1999. The South African may have wondered why he didn't back to the Quad Cities sooner than 2012.
2201	2201	20	20	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s close, and Riviera has been kind to him – top-4 finishes five times since T-10 in 2009. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
4103	4103	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A win in Fiji on the PGA Tour of Australasia two years ago slightly saves face, but there are obvious concerns at $11,500 and I am tempted to fade him this week. Brooks Koepka ($10,900) – Brooks Koepka at $10,900, are you crazy? Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best.
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
5380	5380	13	13	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – St. Jude Classic  Lock of the week:  Francesco Molinari $10,500 – We’ve seen a mixed bag of winners here at TPC Southwind as there have been both accuracy guys and bombers that have prevailed to win this championship. However, Molinari can win on either for the results he has been producing lately. He’s consistently played well all year making 10/11 cuts with three T10s.
4171	4171	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While both make their debuts at TPC Louisiana, it’s a Pete Dye design and Grace has already thrived on such courses despite limited opportunities, most notably when winning at Harbour Town a year ago. Oosthuizen’s long, straight driving has to be considered a huge asset given the roll of honour at this lengthy par 72, and like Grace he’s been on the fringes of contention for much of 2017 without quite putting the pieces together, although he was mighty close in Phoenix back in February. The chief reason for liking them here is that we know they are a formidable force both when sharing a ball and when playing their own.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
7398	7398	2	2	target: Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
8017	8017	36	36	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
9014	9014	13	14	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Xander Schauffele – $9,700  The are pretty slim pickings at the top of the board this week. Thomas, Matsuyama and Casey are all good options and clearly the elite of the field, but my favorite golfer in terms of price, ownership and upside has to be Xander Schauffele.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
4230	4230	1	2	target: B. Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. B. Haas – Should be playing better than he is. Look for a top 5 here.
2032	2032	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
5154	5154	43	44	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the highest purse behind only the four majors, THE PLAYERS, and the four WGC events, there’s plenty to get excited about in Columbus this week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – William McGirt  2015 – David Lingmerth  2014 – Hideki Matsuyama  2013 – Matt Kuchar  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Justin Rose  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – K.J.

Pinterest Chris Condon  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Dustin Johnson  Jason Day  Rory McIlroy  Hideki Matsuyama  Brooks Koepka  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Bubba Watson  Professor's Explanation: Firestone is a big track.

332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
5621	5621	40	40	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will come into play a lot more than on a regular course, because putting will be neutralized a bit with just getting to greens being a struggle. Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy.
6636	6636	21	22	target: Curtis Luck 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the defending champion of the Greenbrier Classic - why should you keep an eye on him this weekend? And finally, Curtis Luck might be just a rookie - but why might he surprise the field in Virginia? Tune in to find you that and more!
9148	9148	15	16	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’re comfortable enough with Nick in GPPs or cash game contests. Best bargain basement option:  Aaron Wise $6,900 – We love Wise this week in GPP contests as we anticipate his ownership around 5%. Wise trains at TPC Summerlin and calls it a home track.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
12783	12783	52	53	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money. A winner of the Farmers Insurance Open in January, a course that has seen Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson triumph in the past, Day captured his 11th PGA Tour title and first for 20 months. From there 2nd at Pebble Beach and a competitive 22nd at Bay Hill after a month's inactivity highlight a player who's playing some decent stuff under the radar.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
41	41	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#TheBarclays Long Shot Bets: Vegas 150/1, Stefani 250/1, Glover 150/1.
1981	1981	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, there's that gamble. Kirk skipped Pebble last year and missed the cut the year before, He was runner-up to Snedeker in 2013. Stewart Cink - $7,500 (Field, 3-1)    Cink is playing this year via his one-time career money list exemption, and he's making the most of it.
8851	8851	33	34	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Matt Kuchar being priced at $7,700 on Draftkings he will make a great cash-game play or just throw him in as a core player in your GPP lineups, you won't regret it. Paul Casey @ $8,600  I don't think that there's a whole lot that I need to say about Paul Casey. He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week.
2357	2357	1	1	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays. Grace is also 37th in greens in regulation percentage. There’s also the fact seven of the last nine winners of the Honda Classic weren’t from the United States.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
6810	6810	15	16	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s good value given his rise in form and will be low owned in gpps. Roberto Castro ($6,500): Castro finally showed some signs of life last week with a T20 finish, his best of 2017. Castro has generally struggled in all areas this year but the fact he put together three rounds in the 60’s for he first time since 2016 is noticeable.
11018	11018	30	31	target: Tom Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Tom Hoge $6,600 – Hollywood Hoge is somewhat of a gut call down here in this range. He’s a tremendous ball striker from tee to green but cursed with the ever elusive hot and cold putter.
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
4099	4099	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
13410	13410	68	68	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's almost two years since the affable veteran started a final round within two strokes of the lead and while there's plenty to indicate that he's just about as good as ever, that's not enough to be confident at prices no bigger than 20/1. Charley Hoffman can play this place blindfolded and will become the default selection for many, but it's another former champion in the reliable Brendan Steele who looks better value at around the 40/1 mark. TPC San Antonio is a fairly long, very demanding course which we know plays to Steele's strengths.
3613	3613	13	14	target: Marc Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There seems to be no course that can over match this young phenom. Marc Leishman – $7,100  Even though Marc Leishman was a late addition to the DraftKings player pool, they still got his price wrong. His odds suggest he should be priced about $500 more, as does his recent form.
10434	10434	25	25	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki should easily be among the highest-owned players on all DFS golf websites, but he’s more than worth the salary and attention this week. Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season.
463	463	2	2	target: Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thoughts on Brehm at $5900 on DK? 9th in DD / 33rd in BirdieAvg on @WebDotComTour last year. Slow greens neutralize poor putting... #DFS
6759	6759	9	10	target: Zach Johnson). 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steve Stricker from the Cheesehead state and Iowa native Zach Johnson). Take a look at the previous winners below:  2009 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2011 – Steve Stricker (Yes Back to Back to Back)  2012 – Zach Johnson  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2015- Jordan Spieth  2016 – Ryan Moore  You can start to notice a trend with the players that have won here, they are great putters on the green. TPC Deere Run is a Par 71 playing at 7,268 yards.
5380	5380	12	13	target: Francesco Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – St. Jude Classic  Lock of the week:  Francesco Molinari $10,500 – We’ve seen a mixed bag of winners here at TPC Southwind as there have been both accuracy guys and bombers that have prevailed to win this championship. However, Molinari can win on either for the results he has been producing lately. He’s consistently played well all year making 10/11 cuts with three T10s.
3861	3861	10	11	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantastic player to throw in your Cash or GPP lineups. Kyle Stanley $7,200 – Stanley is coming off a T8 at the Shell, T17 at Bay Hill, and T27 at Valspar. He leads the PGA Tour in the Ball-Striking statistic which is the most heavily weighted stat this week at Harbour Town.
13267	13267	24	25	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Editor’s Note: Adam Hadwin has withdrawn from this week’s RBC Heritage Open. Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Marc Leishman, Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Kuchar, Brian Harman, Kevin Kisner, Charley Hoffman, Xander Schauffele, Francesco Molinari, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ian Poulter, Cameron Smith, Webb Simpson, Adam Hadwin, Si-WOOOO Kim, Satoshi Kodaira, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Martin Kaymer, Vijay Singh and Bryson Dechambeau are all in the 2018 Heritage field, and each one played the weekend in Augusta. Patrick Cantlay, Jason Dufner, Kevin Chappell, Ross Fisher, Dylan Frittelli, Charl Schwartzel, Ted Potter Jr., Billy Horschel, Doc Redman, Austin Cook and defending champion Wes Bryan all had aspirations of donning the Green Jacket, but that dream ended on Friday for them.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
1648	1648	10	10	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#HondaClassic Futures Berger +4500 Knox +4500 Scott +5000 Henley +5000 Kizzire +6600 Bradley +9000 Consensus outr… https://t.co/jRr5dO2ulO
2026	2026	48	48	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But seriously, he hasn’t missed three cuts in a row since 2013, his play earlier in this season has still been solid, and his history in this tournament is just as sensational as the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open. So while others hopefully zag away from Walker, I will keep zigging and just address the elephant in the room later if he burns me again. Middle of the Road  Phil Mickelson $9,300 – Here’s a fun thing: apparently mild hernias are not that hard to recover from.
7836	7836	37	38	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matsuyama is second in par 4 scoring and tenth in SG: Off the Tee for the season, and is coming off three straight top 15 finishes (including a T2 at the US Open). He’s been outperformed by Brooks Koepka in the past month, but only barely, and for a cheaper price could easily flip the script here. Jon Rahm ($9,700): Rahm seems to have been mildly dismissed by the salary makers at DraftKings this week as his sub-10k price doesn’t seem to factor in his dominate win in Ireland just three weeks ago.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
8939	8939	38	39	target: Gary Woodland. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's joined by the Tour Championship winner Xander Schauffele and runner-up here 12 months ago Hideki Matsuyama. This week's field also includes Tour Championship qualifiers Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Adam Hadwin, Pat Perez, Kyle Stanley, Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland. Throw-in talented players of the ilk of course winner Anirban Lahiri, Branden Grace, Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel and Thomas Pieters.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
10012	10012	16	17	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
4057	4057	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
9131	9131	15	16	target: Webb Simpson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2014 - Ben Martin: Round 1: 19th, Round 2: 5th, Round 3: 1st. 2013 - Webb Simpson: Round 1: 6th, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 1st. 2012 - Ryan Moore: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 3rd, Round 3: 1st.
10100	10100	7	8	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Outright Bets to Win  Brian Harman 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  JJ Spaun 65/1  First Round Leader  Jon Rahm 15/1  Russell Knox 45/1  Chez Reavie 50/1  Brian Stuard 75/1  Sam Saunders 120/1  Doubles  Jon Rahm 8/1  Brian Harman 15/1  Kevin Kisner 20/1  Patton Kizzire 30/1  Chris Kirk 55/1  Euro  Dustin Johnson 5/1  Rory Mcilroy 7/1  Justin Rose 8/1  Branden Grace 22/1  Tommy Fleetwood 40/1 We'll touch on those at the end. We'll just get right to it with the first tip, the La Quinta Course is the Easiest of the 3 so we should target guys that tee off early on this course first on Thurs for the First Round Leader bets.
12398	12398	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're chasing and have no qualms about sending anyone out, zone in on the last four champions – Day (2014, 2016), McIlroy (2015) and Dustin Johnson (2017). Day and DJ could square off in the quarterfinals, but you already knew that. Bring it on.
5002	5002	13	14	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – DEAN & DELUCA Invitational  Lock of the week:  Sergio Garcia $10,800 – We absolutely love Sergio this week on a course that should set up well for a tremendous ball striker like he is. Strokes Gained off the Tee and Strokes Gained Approach are two of our favorite stat categories this week and Garcia is amongst the top 20 in the field in both. The Spaniard faltered a little on Sunday last week but had a tremendous back nine 29 on Saturday and is still on a heater coming off that Masters win in April.
3392	3392	35	36	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even if you do hole them you have to hole them comfortably because if you’re grinding over every three-footer it becomes a burden. Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
9538	9538	45	46	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
2575	2575	22	22	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
1063	1063	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar. It's easy to wait on Kuchar since he's so consistent week-to-week.
4718	4718	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option  Anirban Lahiri $6,400 – We wanted to go super basement option here and give you a guy you can pair with DJ comfortably. There’s a lot of good value in the upper $6K range this week, but Lahiri is our guy in the bottom of this range. Now, if you were paying attention on Friday at TPC, Lahiri was -6 on his round approaching the 18th tee, where he then proceeded to hit 3 tee shots in the water left to miss the cut by 4 shots.
11227	11227	24	25	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players whom they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Sergio Garcia  Making his 2018 U.S. debut, the reigning Masters champion has the ball-striking prowess to succeed at PGA National. He finished second to Adam Scott in 2016 and already has a victory to his name earlier this year at the Singapore Open.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
13216	13216	37	37	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Full team course history with this play because he has not been playing well at all. Betting Card  Outrights:  Hadwin 33/1 WD  Grillo 40/1  Kisner 45/1  List 55/1  Molinari 60/1 + E/W  Si Woo 100/1 + T10  Cook 100/1 + T10  T10 – Donald 10/1  It’s grown more than I intended but they are pretty light bets on the bottom 5 guys, with the emphasis at the top. Be sure to follow me on twitter (@FantasyJesusDFS) if you don’t already.

11467	11467	36	36	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why it is so hard to bypass Justin Thomas, who actually was leading the tournament after three rounds a year ago, a shot ahead of Johnson, but faded to a 1-over 72. Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
9692	9692	15	16	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watch those Fanshare tags, if he is low then I’ll be all over him. “Value”  Gary Woodland $7,800 – His last 3 starts here: 6th, 13th, 3rd. I will have plenty and he will more than likely be on my cash team.
3641	3641	5	6	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RBC Heritage Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Bill Haas & Graeme McDowell – If it’s a Dye design, it’s time to roll out Haas in your lineups. He’s gained strokes on the field around the greens in seven straight events, made 12 consecutive cuts, and keeps posting quality results on the Dye layouts (3rd/T17/T43/T14/T9/T9)… Before no-showing the Puerto Rico Open, GMAC was starting to recapture his game again.
8440	8440	47	48	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some stats below from the opening round of the Playoffs over the past few years:  P ath to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Patrick Reed: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 2nd. 2015 - Jason Day: Round 1: 18th, Round 2: 8th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Hunter Mahan: Round 1: 2nd, Round 2: 12th, Round 3: 3rd.
13060	13060	36	37	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we are focusing on the 8K and up range this week, all of these guys have a legitimate chance of winning this tournament, but like I said earlier, you have to make a stand somewhere. Phil Mickelson: DK $9500/FD $11200  All you really need to do is look at the picture at the top of this page. Phil is wearing a collared, button up shirt, with his jumpman logo on the cuffs, in a practice round.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
11019	11019	25	25	target: Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tremendous ball striker from tee to green but cursed with the ever elusive hot and cold putter. Since the season started in October, Hoge has been in position to win his first PGA Tour event three times but failed to close the door. Unfortunately, two of his three missed cuts all season have come in the last two weeks.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
11206	11206	42	42	target: Anirban 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
2320	2320	40	41	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t expect much different this week either. Beyond Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas, all the top ranked players in the field are internationals: Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Branden Grace, Russell Knox, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Francesco Molinari, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald and Thomas Pieters. We even get a quartet of Brits making the trek to America for the first time this year: Danny Willet, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ty Hatton and Ian Poulter.
9697	9697	0	1	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event. Although he known for being one of the longest drivers on the tour Woodland is also able to keep the ball in play. At this event, this has resulted in a T6, T13 and T3 the last three years here at the Sony Open.
2471	2471	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking. Garcia was excellent off-the-tee last week, but struggled mightily on the greens. He should be in for some positive regression this week.
10350	10350	21	21	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now he'll head to his old stomping grounds in Scottsdale, the area he played his college golf. After a tough Saturday, Rahm may have shifted his focus to Phoenix a bit early. Given his comfort in the area, I wouldn't be worried about any fatigue issues.
555	555	5	5	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only 8 measures rounds, but Rory is gaining 3.125 strokes Off the Tee + Approach per round. That's more than DJ &amp; Spieth COMBINED.
6889	6889	8	8	target: Stricker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since this event moved to Deere Run, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson, Kenny Perry and Jordan Spieth have won both tournaments and Tim Clark has come close to winning both, finishing runner-up in each event. Sean O'Hair, who won this tournament in 2005, finished tied for second in this year's Dean & Deluca alongside Deere Run specialist, Jordan Spieth, and the 2014 JDC winner, Brian Harman, finished tied for seventh alongside Stricker at this year's Dean & Deluca. Check out Valspar Championship form too as four men have won that tournament as well as this one - the aforementioned Spieth, John Senden, Sean O'Hair and Vijay Singh.
12175	12175	13	13	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he's converting on the greens, he has us at, "Cheers!" If both Woods and Rose are available to you, they might as well just line up as your picks for the API and the Masters in whichever quinella you prefer. We're treated to the steady contributions of Tommy Fleetwood and Alex Noren again this week, but they'll be there again for us at next week's Match Play where no one will want to square off against either.
1028	1028	7	7	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
2604	2604	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play. At $400 less than Matsuyama, who will likely be more widely owned, the globe-trotting Swede is the play at the new venue.
9555	9555	17	17	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DeChambeau does the other stuff pretty well. And if you want some odd connection, here it is: DeChambeau got here by winning the John Deere, and this tournament has been won four times by Deere winners in the past seven years: Spieth, Zach Johnson, Steve Stricker and Jonathan Byrd. (No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.)
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
9127	9127	125	125	target: Simpson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Patrick Cantlay; 2) Brian Stuard; 3) Luke List; 4) Gary Woodland; 5) Martin Laird; 6) Charley Hoffman / Vaughn Taylor; 8) Harold Varner III; 9) Ryan Armour; 10) Brandon Hagy / Adam Schenk / Bubba Watson; 13) Kevin Chappell / Matt Jones / Rob Oppenheim / Sam Saunders; 17) Corey Conners; 18) Alex Cejka / Brice Garnett / Chesson Hadley / William McGirt.

12033	12033	28	29	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
992	992	0	2	target: B. De Jonge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			B. De Jonge is a sleeper pick this week as he should be low owned and have an outside chance to win the event. I have mentioned Tommy Gainey before, but he has let me down….. so I won’t say anything about him this week.
1013	1013	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Also like: Kevin Chappell and Charles Howell III. Chappell had a breakout campaign last season and that included a runner-up finish at Sea Island.
5434	5434	20	20	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell could easily fall between the cracks as he is competing with this week’s chalk, Kyle Stanley at $8,400. If Chappell hadn’t won a few weeks back at the Valero Texas Open, I honestly believe this would be the event we all would be saying was his to win. William McGirt – $7,300  Why is nobody talking about McGirt?!
7870	7870	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can. EXPERT ROB BOLTON , Fantasy Columnist LINEUP | BENCH Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth It’s all about rationing starts right now. So, with no cut at Firestone, there’s no urgency to burn one on Spieth.
8946	8946	9	10	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But a number of other big-name players will feature. Paul Casey, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Branden Grace, Thomas Pieters, Ian Poulter and Charl Schwartzel are all on the start sheet. Branden Grace swing sequence:  This will be the eighth time the CIMB Classic has featured on the PGA Tour.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
1022	1022	25	26	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
7121	7121	53	53	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Aussie isn’t having his best season, but has been finding form recently. He’s posted Top 10s in two of his last five starts, and sits inside the Top 20 versus the field in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, SG: Approach, SG: Off-The-Tee, and in Par 3 efficiency from the key range of 175-200 yards… Grace has never missed a British Open cut, despite a lack of top end results. But his fate will be tied to the weather.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
119	119	46	47	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tournament Skill Averages :  Driving Distance: 32nd, Driving Accuracy: 22nd, Greens in Regulation: 12th, Proximity to Hole: 20th, Scrambling: 30th, Putting Average 27th. So let's take a view from players as to how Bethpage Black played at the 2012 Barclays and what specific skills it requires:  Bubba Watson : "I think it'll be a tough test. Again, that's the only time I've played it, so I don't know if they can firm up the greens.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
12789	12789	33	34	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five of the world's top 10 have already won in 2018, with Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy picking up victories as recently as the Florida Swing. Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
9474	9474	36	36	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s even with his untimely stair-fall Augusta back injury that limited him quite badly as he wasn’t quite the same golfer until, of course, he shipped the Northern Trust in August. I can imagine that if Rahm looks at stat ranks, DJ is without question the stormy cloud that reminds him that he’s just not quite there yet. DJ gained an average of 1.002 OTT and .702 APR last year and, like Rahm, with only .104 gained ARG, he posted an absolutely disgusting 1.809 SG:T2G average per round.
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
4174	4174	12	12	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bar a lack of course experience, negatives begin and end with putting. Grace was very poor on the greens for much of last week’s Valero Texas Open and Oosthuizen was baffled by Augusta’s lightning surfaces, but this course has always been more about ball-striking (hence a list of poor-putting winners) and on that front perhaps only Stenson and Rose can be labelled superior to this pair. The Europeans are respected, but Stenson has gone right off the boil and Rose will be teeing it up for the first time since a heartbreaking Augusta defeat.
10026	10026	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer. And I say that as a good thing.
8940	8940	43	44	target: Gary Woodland; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) Jim Herman; 13) Paul Casey; 14) Graeme DeLaet / Richy Werenski; 16) Hao Tong Li / Brendan Steele; 18) Jason Dufner / Lucas Glover; 20) Rafael Cabrera-Bello. Greens in Regulation : 1) Paul Casey / Brendan Steele; 3) Graham DeLaet / Gary Woodland; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Stewart Cink; 7) Pat Perez / Harold Varner III; 9) Justin Thomas; 10) Bud Cauley; 11) Jason Dufner / Hudson Swafford; 13) Keegan Bradley / Luke List; 15) Hao Tong Li / Kyle Stanley; 17) Emiliano Grillo; 18) Scott Hend; 19) Martin Flores; 20) Grayson Murray. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Kevin Na; 4) Xander Schauffele; 5) Richy Werenski; 6) D.A.
12100	12100	41	41	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large. Arnold Palmer Invitational Interactive Data  Note these tools are FREE each week for Pro Members.
732	732	42	43	target: Martin Laird; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan / Vaughn Taylor; 15) Roberto Diaz / Jonathan Randolph; 17) Charley Hoffman / Kevin Na; 19) Maverick McNealy; 20) Jon Curran / Rob Oppenheim. Greens in Regulation : 1) Patrick Cantlay; 2) Brian Stuard; 3) Luke List; 4) Gary Woodland; 5) Martin Laird; 6) Charley Hoffman / Vaughn Taylor; 8) Harold Varner III; 9) Ryan Armour; 10) Brandon Hagy / Adam Schenk / Bubba Watson; 13) Kevin Chappell / Matt Jones / Rob Oppenheim / Sam Saunders; 17) Corey Conners; 18) Alex Cejka / Brice Garnett / Chesson Hadley / William McGirt. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Tyrone Van Aswegen; 2) Tony Finau; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Chesson Hadley / Kevin Na; 6) Jonathan Randolph; 7) Kevin Chappell / Andrew Landry / Scott Piercy; 10) Derek Fathauer / Daniel Summerhays; 12) Joel Dahmen / Shawn Stefani; 14) Brice Garnett / Charley Hoffman / Morgan Hoffmann / Webb Simpson; 18) Rory Sabbatini; 19) Beau Hossler / Graeme McDowell; 21) Martin Laird.
12459	12459	1	1	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form. He showed signs of that in his last start, posting a top 10 at the Valspar.
5941	5941	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect a thrilling finish and bounce backs from McIlroy and Day, who both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Russell Knox  2015 – Bubba Watson  2014 – Kevin Streelman  2013 – Ken Duke  2012 – Marc Leishman  2011 – Fredrik Jacobsen  2010 – Bubba Watson  2009 – Kenny Perry  2008 – Stewart Cink  2007 – Hunter Mahan    Key Stats to Winning at TPC River Highlands    • Par Breakers percentage  • Par 4 scoring average  • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green    Champion's Profile    With an interesting list of both short and long hitters claiming victories in the past, it is clear length has little to do with winning on one of the PGA Tour’s shortest courses. Plenty of shorter holes means birdies can come in bunches and are essential to success here, so look for players with high par-breaker percentages as quality candidates.
1209	1209	12	13	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Career Builder Challenge Webb Simpson 20/1 Chesson Hadley 50/1 JJ Spaun 65/1 David Lingmerth 66/1 Scott Piercy 80/1… https://t.co/pWakq5RrXy
11437	11437	13	14	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Dustin Johnson – $11,900  Boring I know, but whenever DJ is in the field playing at a course he has won at before, it’s so tough not to load up. There is only so much that can be said about DJ before it becomes copy and paste from the week prior.
539	539	2	2	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
613	613	28	29	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey offers some solid cash relief off of the top guys and definitely has shown he can contend with the best in the world. Don’t be shocked if Paul Casey ends up lifting the FedEx Cup trophy come Sunday. Si Woo Kim – $6,700  Since I believe stars and scrubs will be a popular approach to building lineups this week, I think Si Woo Kim will be one of the least popular golfers in the sub $7K range.
2621	2621	10	10	target: Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nobody hits a 3-wood with more confidence and accuracy than Stenson. Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.
10544	10544	25	25	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident. As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh.
7686	7686	35	36	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're looking for a longshot, here's your guy. Pinterest Richard Sellers - PA Images  Expert's Picks  Justin Rose  Marc Leishman  Jordan Spieth  Thomas Pieters  Justin Thomas  Rickie Fowler  Tommy Fleetwood  Rory McIlroy  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Expert's Explanation: Don't sweat the change in caddie ; Rory will be fine.

10204	10204	35	36	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas scares me in cash games, but I totally understand the play if you want to use him in those, as well. -- Taras Pitra  Editor's Picks Weekly 18: Rory McIlroy came back strong, will Tiger Woods do so, too? Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.
3813	3813	36	37	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Morgan Hoffmann ($7,000): With local ties to the area and a recent career-best at the Honda Classic, Hoffmann has a lot of potential but I'm keeping on the front end since he's not the safest option. Jason Dufner ($8,300): Is playing steady golf this season. He's been inside the top 30 thru 36 holes in 9 of his last 10 starts, so you know where I'll be placing him this week.
1115	1115	9	9	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@RBaroff427 I can assure you one thing. I have Ollie bet every way possible and always do!

439	439	3	4	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
12507	12507	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Be aggressive. Phil Mickelson: "The style of play here is totally different than Augusta. The rope is at 300 yards or so off the tee, everything pitches in here and every tee shot has a hazard in play.
4738	4738	36	36	target: Kang 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be very popular this week, as he has the second most tags on FanShareSports.com, but I am will to put Finau in 40-50% of my lineups this week to create the required separation. Sung Kang – $7,400  Why not make it two consecutive wins for South Koreans? Even without the Si Woo Kim bump, Sung Kang would have been a fantastic play this week, as he enters the Byron Nelson with second best recent form other than DJ.
12039	12039	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jason Day, $12500 – Day enters rested after a win and runner-up his last two starts on TOUR. He paces the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and is plenty long enough to score on the par-5s this week.
9992	9992	31	31	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The roll-of-honour in the CareerBuilder Challenge, which takes in three courses before a 54-hole cut determines which players can have another crack at one of them, tells you a lot. Although Mickelson features twice and Arnold Palmer used to win it every other year, names like Mark Wilson, Brian Gay and even Hudson Swafford confirm that this is something of a Tier 2 event. This is a good thing and there is some temptation to simply row in with Rahm given that he appears to have little to beat and has enjoyed a rise so meteoric that double-figure prices look generous.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
6003	6003	1	2	target: David Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. David Lingmerth, $7,900  After a poor start to the season, Lingmerth has found the form that made the 29-year-old one of the game’s most interesting prospects in 2015-16. The Swede has four top-21 finishes in his last five events, smashing salary-based expectation each time.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.

Rickie Fowler (DraftKings $11,700, FanDuel $12,300: Rickie will look to earn his ticket back to the Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the same way he did last year, by winning the Honda Classic.
4863	4863	47	48	target: Jason Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Amazingly Jon Rahm heads the betting, which is a measure of his meteoric rise along with the lack of strength in depth in the field. The Spaniard is a class act but I think the title might be heading to another elite ball-striker in the shape of Jason Dufner. Twice a runner-up at Colonial he finished T6 last year and it’s clearly a course he gets on well with.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
11856	11856	28	28	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his career success at Heritage hasn’t translated to Valspar yet, the South African’s knack for smacking quality irons and saving himself around the greens should translate perfectly. Grace lost strokes on his approaches in Mexico for the first time all season, yet he continued his season-long trend of saving pars from missed GIRs. If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa.
5594	5594	21	22	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
5881	5881	22	23	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finishing position in brackets:  2016: Russell Knox -10 (Winner); Jerry Kelly (2nd) Shawn Stefani (11th) -9; Tyrone Van Aswegen (5th) -8. 2015: Bubba Watson -12 (Winner); Bo Van Pelt (7th) -10; Paul Casey (2nd) -9; Curran (10th), Delaet (4th), Gore (10th), Harman (3rd), Pettersson (5th) -8. 2014: Kevin Streelman (Winner), Brandt Snedeker (11th) -11; K.J.
8139	8139	22	23	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can see him being highly owned, but he is cash worthy no matter how highly touted he is, in my opinion. Gary Woodland $6,700 – Played awful Thursday and Friday of last week, but bounced back decently well on the weekend with a 69 on Sunday. He hits it long enough and should have less ownership than he would’ve with a good showing last week.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
4150	4150	21	22	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
6424	6424	2	3	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: DQ  Bryson DeChambeau 0.75pt EW 90/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Bryson DeChambeau is a little like a box of chocolates, you just never know what you are going to get. However, this is the kind of low-key tournament where a talent like DeChambeau could fire, challenge and more than likely take the title. If we're looking for a motive, it appears that Bryson has noticed that he's outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and clearly he doesn't want to go through the stress of the web.com Playoffs again.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
1628	1628	30	30	target: Snedeker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one shot adrift when play resumed on the Monday, but winds from the opposite direction meant Jimmy Walker, Kevin Streelman and most notably KJ Choi failed to better Snedeker. Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
896	896	4	5	target: Charley Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So you never know. Charley Hoffman. OK, his form coming in is troublesome to say the least (he’s missed his first two cuts of the 2016-17 PGA Tour season).
11606	11606	27	28	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At least he's aware of and willing to confront the issue, rather than making excuses; to me that looks like a step in the right direction. Interview: Paul Casey 'buzzing like a young pro' to be back on European Tour with a Ryder Cup place in his sights https://t.co/UOoefzi2bi — Telegraph Sport (@TelegraphSport) January 16, 2018  Casey ended the interview by stating "you could say we are highly-motivated, yes" and with form at altitude including at Crans, this golf course looks one of the more suitable in the run-up to Augusta, where he also tends to play well. I know full well that won't do for everyone and I'm usually keen to take on players with his strike-rate, but this is one rare occasion I can't resist.
6271	6271	26	26	target: Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One angle that will be played up this week is that the web.com Tour hosted events here in 2012 and 2013. One of the winners, David Lingmerth, is in this field and gaining steam in the industry. Not only is Lingmerth in great form, but clearly he’ll have positive memories to draw upon.
5673	5673	21	22	target: Russell Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This market is deep and I'm happy to leave it alone. There are only three in the Top Scot market - Russell Knox, Martin Laird and Richie Ramsay and I'm more than happy to take the 11/8 about Knox. Ramsay's home course is Royal Aberdeen so he might take to Erin Hills but he's not in great form and nor is Laird.
330	330	6	6	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
13091	13091	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t putt. The last time Scott gained strokes on the green was at the WGC Bridgestone last July. Not great, Bob.
5319	5319	11	12	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The less our players have to scramble the better. Core Plays  Rickie Fowler ($12,000) – Never thought I would see the day that I pay $12,000 for Rickie Fowler. That is the kind of year this guy is having though.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
3679	3679	27	27	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
7286	7286	13	14	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A number of shrewd punters are holding fancy positions on Southport's very own Tommy Fleetwood and after hitting a low of [22.0], he's drifted out to a much more appealing [28.0] for no reason at all. After his brilliance at the US Open, where he finished fourth, a respectable sixth in Germany just seven days later, victory in the Open de France and a very fair 10th in Ireland two weeks ago, Fleetwood is one of the hottest golfers in the field. It's hard to envisage Fleetwood not contending but I just wonder whether strong home expectations might pile on a bit too much pressure.
1652	1652	21	21	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA DFS T10 Model 1. Fleets 2. Hatton 3. JT 4. Noren 5. Rory 6. CH3 7. Sergio 8. Woodland 9. Hadley 10. Kaymer
11205	11205	30	30	target: Garcia's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago. The week before, he won the Singapore Open.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
309	309	27	27	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
1623	1623	17	17	target: Tommy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 adds just now over at sportsbook: Knox 50 Ollie 60 Kizzire 60 They join from yesterday: Tommy 30, Harman 35, Billy Ho 100
9312	9312	60	61	target: Dustin Johnson; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			doesn’t have a huge correlation at this course, but it does have a strong correlation to making birdies. The Golfers  Justin Thomas ($11100): This may be a good spot to get the reigning champion at lower-than-expected ownership (relative to the size of the field), with JT priced at the top of the field ahead of past winners Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson; Thomas won last year as he went nuclear to kick off his 2017, and he should be able to keep that up this week. Thomas was the best golfer from 50-125 yards out last year (15’6” from the cup on average) and was the sixth-best golfer in SG: Approach.
2527	2527	56	57	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rafa Cabrera-Bello is another frequent contender on the European Tour’s tighter courses and he's a factor here at 100/1, but again that’s a price which says his consistency should be considered a more valuable asset than Willett’s class and with four rounds for everyone, I’m not sure that’s the case. Instead, I like the look of Tommy Fleetwood at twice the price. The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East.
2239	2239	40	41	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about: he's got two top-sixes and two more top-20s to start the year; he's made five straight cuts at Riviera; he's from Southern California and knows kikuyu; and he's fifth in scrambling, 13th in GIR and T26 in proximity. J.B. Holmes - $7,100 (40-1)    The oddsmakers don't consider DFS pricing before acting, but Holmes' price certainly doesn't jibe with his odds, and in a good way. He has had great success at Riviera, with six top-12s through the years, including T11 last year.
5966	5966	25	26	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But enough rambling; here's what the Professor has to say for the 2017 Travelers Championship. Pinterest Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth Jason Day Rory McIlroy Brandt Snedeker Justin Thomas Tony Finau Patrick Reed Webb Simpson Paul Casey Kevin Na  Professor's Explanation : The top three picks come out strong (in the event) almost every time. Their “long term” stats are so good, they get strong results on almost any course.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
1637	1637	45	46	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 5 winners  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top ten performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016). The other three either hadn’t played for at least 3 weeks or finished outside the top 50 the week prior.
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
6531	6531	35	35	target: Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (DK: $7,800, FD: $8,100)    Walker is a guy that I like to target anytime where approach shots will be at a premium. He sometimes sprays if off of the tee, but similar to Holmes, the wide fairways should help mask some of those problems. Walker has been struggling will illness this year and is coming off of two straight missed cuts, but he is a good enough long-term golfer where you have to believe a rebound is coming.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
1247	1247	1	1	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
5228	5228	20	21	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week. Adam Hadwin – $7,600  Adam Hadwin was heavily owned last week, and even though he didn’t miss the cut, he certainly didn’t win anyone money. Hadwin only has six tags on FanShareSports, clearly showing people have already moved on.
12606	12606	21	21	target: Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Coming off the missed cut at the API mixed with less than stellar course history could lead to lower ownership. Nick Watney $6,800 – I think this price is about $500 too low, so I will take advantage of the savings. Tom Lovelady $7,400 – Never played here but has finished top 20 in 2 of his last 3 starts.
1836	1836	11	12	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I will buy him until I am blue in the face. Jon Rahm ($9,600) – As long as DK continues to offer Rahm at under $10,000, I will continue to buy him. He’s just too strong of a golfer with too great of a chance to ship on any given week to fade.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
2283	2283	14	15	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he will be chalk, don’t get cute and fade DJ in cash. Paul Casey – $8,600  Paul Casey ended the 2016 season with some of his best golf of his career. He went through the FedEx cup playoffs pounding out top 5 results.
13639	13639	32	33	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Henrik Stenson, Zach Johnson, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
421	421	11	11	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bets out early this week! Arnold Palmer Bets: Outright: Rose E/W: Kisner McDowell Perez FRL: Saunders

168	168	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To steal a line from Samuel L. Jackson in the first Jurassic Park, "Hold on to your butts." Jonathan Coachman -- Jason Day ($12,400)  Bethpage Black is a "big boys" golf course. There are a lot of holes that have long carries and long approach shots.
7624	7624	54	55	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This isn’t incredibly groundbreaking information, but you’ll want to roster golfers who can take advantage of the short Par 5s and who are in good recent form in terms of accuracy. The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively.
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods – $10,000  Personal note – I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.
5457	5457	76	77	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Welcome to the 60th edition of the FedEx St. Jude Classic, otherwise known as either a U.S. Open tune-up or a last-gasp effort to make it into the U.S. Open field. A weak-field event, the FESJ includes six of the top 30 golfers in the current FedEx Cup standings and eight of the top 30 in the Official World Golf Ranking: Rickie Fowler (9), Adam Scott (12), Francesco Molinari (16), Charl Schwartzel (21), Brooks Koepka (22), Phil Mickelson (23), Kevin Chappell (26) and Rafa Cabrera-Bello (30). Players face a stern test this week ahead of their U.S. Open final exam (should they be lucky enough to sit for it).
3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
11154	11154	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton 25/1  The Englishman has been in super form recently and hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in his last six starts. Since winning the Alfred Dunhill Links and Italian Open back to back in October, Hatton followed that with an impressive T11 at the WGC HSBC Champions in China. He then travelled to Turkey finishing T16 at the Turkish Airlines Open followed by a T19 at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa.
8431	8431	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth. 1 - Jonas Blixt, Keegan Bradley, Jason Dufner, Emiliano Grillo, Bill Haas, James Hahn, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Hideki Matsuyama, William McGirt, Geoff Ogilvy, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Scott Stallings, Brendan Steele, Henrik Stenson, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland.
10176	10176	54	54	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprise, surprise, he missed the cut at Torrey in both 2013 and 2014 as his game dipped in general but, after making it to the weekend in 2015, he improved to T25 in 2016 and jumped again to T14 last year. In the table of biggest Net gain in world rankings points for 2017, Stanley placed 11th after making a massive surge from 258th at the start of the year to 48th at the end. He's now up to 45th.
3599	3599	28	29	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
2433	2433	11	12	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 on Tour in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season truly dangerous. Sergio Garcia ($10,900) – What’s not to like about this choice? He’s been playing well recently (a win in Dubai three weeks ago featured four rounds in the 60s).
9734	9734	56	57	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi    Key Stats to Winning at Waialae CC    • Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green  • Greens in Regulation percentage  • Putting inside 10 feet  • Par Breakers    Champion’s Profile    Traditionally, driving accuracy has been crucial for success, but dry weather changes the profile for a second straight year. Last year’s dry spell resulted in sparse rough, which allowed Justin Thomas to run away with victory despite finishing 66th in driving accuracy (he was 1st in SG: Tee-to-Green). Given the similar conditions a year later, players – much like last year – can get away with missing more fairways so long as they are in position to hit the green in regulation.
1921	1921	27	28	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry $7,000 – Very low price, Oostyesque if you know what I’m saying. C-List  Cameron Smith $6,900  Jim Herman $6,900  Ryan Brehm $6,700  Steve Stricker $6,600  Robert Garrigus $6,600  That is all for this week. Per the usual hit me up on twitter if you have questions or need help.
13481	13481	40	48	target: Kevin Streelman ($7,700), Jason Kokrak ($7,400) and Kevin Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After him, the $8,000 range has what appears to be some good values in Xander Schauffele ($8,800), Ryan Palmer ($8,300) and former winner Brendan Steele ($8,900). Other values to consider for this format include Jamie Lovemark ($7,700), Keegan Bradley ($7,900), Kevin Streelman ($7,700), Jason Kokrak ($7,400) and Kevin Tway ($7,000). Tournaments — This is a weaker field, so going under $7K doesn’t look very appealing, although if you select the right golfer (as we saw with last week’s RBC winner) you can potentially gain a huge advantage.
7388	7388	20	21	target: Matt Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
6178	6178	34	35	target: Rory McIlroy: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ultimately, we're looking at another second-shot golf course this week with greens in regulation percentage, proximity to the hole, and iron play from 150 to 200 yards key this week. Creme de la Creme  Rory McIlroy: $11,600  If Rory McIlroy doesn't barnstorm his way around this course and make one million birdies, he's not Rory McIlroy. Seriously.

12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
12007	12007	13	14	target: Justin Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill.
4634	4634	106	107	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
703	703	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			made two bets for the Valero so far Palmer 50 to 1 Reed 35 to 1 Holding pattern for tee times / weather
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
3068	3068	38	39	target: Bryson DeChambeau, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Ben Crane, Seamus Power  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Graeme McDowell, Peter Uihlein, Fabrizio Zanotti, Danny Lee, John Peterson, Michael Thompson, Thorbjorn Olesen, Harold Varner III, Andrew Johnston  – Brandon Hagy, JT Poston, Zac Blair, Bryson DeChambeau, Boo Weekley, Ben Crane, Seamus Power, Ryan Brehm  Bets:  Peter Uihlein 33-1  John Peterson 70-1  Harold Varner 80-1  Michael Thompson 100-1 While he comes in off the back of three missed cuts he’s a player who can find form fast and has two top twenties to his name already in 2017, and also won a web.com playoff event late in 2016. He’s played well at windy venues before (won the Honda Classic back in 2013) and has also made the cut at this event in all three appearances.
5773	5773	36	37	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose (5): Been quiet recently but a T12 at the BMW PGA Championship was a nice sign that his game is still there. =SUPER SUBS=  Steve Stricker, Brandt Snedeker, Francesco Molinari, Webb Simpson      Group C  Brooks Koepka (6): Has played a busy schedule since the Masters and for good reason. His game is trending well and he's never backed down from a USGA setup, posting T18 or better in his last three U.S. Open appearances.
2270	2270	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele comes here in much better form than he did last year and looks great value to keep up his good run of form here. Keegan Bradley 80/1  I was quite surprised to see Keegan Bradley at such a big price this week considering the form he’s in. He finished 2016 with three top 15’s in four events finishing solo sixth at the CIMB Classic, T7 at The Shriners Open and a T15 at the OHL Classic.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
13683	13683	0	1	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
11226	11226	62	63	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Bob Harig  Daniel Berger  Neither form nor recent course history seems like it's on his side -- he MC'd in last week's Genesis Open and each of the last two editions of the Honda -- but he's played well so far this year and is back on home turf at an event where he once reached a playoff. -- Jason Sobel  Luke Donald  Donald has his spots on the PGA Tour, and this is one of them. The fact that he was able to make the cut last week and not finish last on a course that rewards strong off the tee play is a good thing.
6002	6002	9	9	target: Leishman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TRAVELERS CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE HISTORY : THE GOOD  1. Marc Leishman, $9,300  Leishman has played this event in each of the last five years, making the cut each time and never finishing worse than 39th. It’s a run which includes a win in 2012, an 11th in 2014 and a ninth last year.
1815	1815	4	5	target: Hideki Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
4157	4157	4	5	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year.
1413	1413	22	22	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sub $8million Salary Players :  Positive: Ryan Blaum and Charles Howell III deserve respect as highlighted and I cannot believe that Chris Kirk is available at ($7.7m). Kirk was top-priced $11.3m at the RSM Classic last time out for him and a missed cut there has seen his salary plummet by $3.6 million. That's a huge downshift and one that needs to exploited as Kirk is a TifDwarf Bermudagrass green specialist who otherwise finished 2016 brilliantly.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
10975	10975	19	20	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am looking for Pieters to draw on his good memories here and put his good form to use. Keegan Bradley ($7.6K) – Keegan Bradley seems to be returning to his Major-winning ways this year. He spent most of last year getting sorted with putting grips and changes.
6900	6900	42	43	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One week after last year's Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III contended for three days at the Greenbrier, don't be surprised to see the current Presidents Cup captain get into the mix on a course where he's won before. -- Jason Sobel  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner has "only" won the John Deere Classic once, but since 2010 his average finish is between seventh and eighth place. The outlier was a T-34 in 2016, but don't be surprised if Johnson posts his first top-10 since March this week in Silvis, Illinois.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
9995	9995	20	20	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I don’t know how it’s going to start out, but I’m very optimistic." Contrast that with a year ago, when Mickelson arrived here with close to zero expectations having had two surgeries since his last competitive outing. In fact, his first full round of golf in over three months came the Saturday before tournament week, so the only thing surprising about a performance which tapered off to 21st was that it started so well.
7881	7881	14	15	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vamos! EXPERT MIKE McALLISTER , Managing Editor LINEUP | BENCH Rickie Fowler  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Jordan Spieth  Branden Grace  Adam Scott  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth Dustin did it earlier this year. No reason why Spieth can’t win three straight.
9207	9207	1	1	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gary Woodland – Cash Games – DK: $9400 FD: $9000  Woodland looked good last week finishing T18 and has shown solid form lately with six straight made cuts. Finishing 2nd here last season Woodland is sure to draw high ownership on both DraftKings and FanDuel given his salary. Chesson Hadley – FanDuel Value – DK: $9900 FD: $7400  Hadley’s price on FanDuel remains ridiculously low for another week.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
8880	8880	0	1	target: Brice Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20. His up and down play makes him an unnecessary risk in cash formats but I like his high ceiling for GPP formats.
669	669	4	5	target: L. List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: L. List - 60/1 J. Spaun - 66/1 N. Taylor - 150/1 M. Jones - 175/1 S. Power - 200/1 Top 20s to follow. Weak field!
11031	11031	40	41	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s always a danger he’ll hit a wall like Brian Harman and Chez Reavie have before him, but he’s simply playing too well to be overlooked, especially when you’re getting a discount because of the bigger names in the field. Martin Kaymer  The former world’s No. 1 has been middling with results for about two years now.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
5436	5436	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week.
10732	10732	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
10232	10232	39	40	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Well both the long bomber and the accurate type with a great short game can contend around Torrey. 2010, 2012 and 2016 saw Ben Crane and Brandt Snedeker triumph, But Bubba Watson, Tiger Woods, Scott Stallings, Jason Day and Jon Rahm are all longer hitters. So realistically we need a 285+ yard driver.
2734	2734	12	13	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I'm dipping a little deeper in the betting market this week. Ryan Moore ticks plenty of boxes this week at a course where he tends to play well. At a test where scoring is likely to be difficult, an experienced level-head is no bad thing.
6309	6309	32	33	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My only concern is he did not play the similar courses on tour very well this season, but he also wasn’t in good form in general, so I can let that slide. Bud Cauley (DK: $7,700, FD: $7,500)    TPC Potomac seems perfectly suited to Cauley’s game. He isn’t long off the tee but is accurate when he is able to club down.
5887	5887	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			275 yards (46th), 85.7% fairways (9th), 72.2% greens in regulation (34th), proximity to hole 32'0" (45th), 95.0% scrambling (1st), 1.67 putts per GIR (11th). 2010, Bubba Watson (-14). 321 yards (1st), 66.1% fairways (58th), 70.8% greens in regulation (38th), proximity to hole 31'5" (25th), 57.1% scrambling (43rd), 1.63 putts per GIR (2nd).
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
86	86	15	16	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rostering one of my least favorite DFS players this week, based on a gut feeling: Chris Kirk.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
310	310	3	3	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
6550	6550	21	22	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We aren’t playing a lot of cash games this week due to the field strength, but we love Keegan in GPPs. Gary Woodland $7,500 – Woodland hasn’t sniffed a top ten since we were wearing sweaters in Georgia, but he’s a consistent cut maker with the upside to win potentially. He’s a bomber that can take advantage of these forgiving fairways.
486	486	34	35	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston. Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week.
10118	10118	15	16	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie has 12th- and 17th-place ties in the last two years at the CareerBuilder, too. Webb Simpson  Happy learned how to putt. Uh oh.
13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.

2051	2051	16	17	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is always a threat in less than normal conditions and this week is just that. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  We were high on Phil in Phoenix last week and he got it within two strokes of the lead making the turn on Sunday before posting a four-over 40 on the back nine to finish 16th. He will look to turn that around this week at a place he absolutely loves.
3812	3812	11	12	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am forgiving him for last week's MC at Augusta National. Jason Dufner (8): His game looks balanced for a change as his putting has been strong recently. If he keeps the putter hot then there is no reason he shouldn't be near the top of the leaderboard come Sunday.
1024	1024	7	8	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			• • •  Mike Glasscott  Projected champion: Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world.
3876	3876	47	48	target: Charley Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 15, and local guy, Patrick Reed headlines the field, along with just eight others currently inside the Top 50 in the world rankings: Matt Kuchar (17), Branden Grace (21), Brooks Koepka (24), Jimmy Walker (25), Ryan Moore (28), Kevin Chappell (41), Adam Hadwin (46), and Charley Hoffman (49). The Masters this is not.
221	221	3	3	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
74	74	25	47	target: Kevin Na $9,100 2016 John Deere Classic DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values Rafa Cabrera-Bello $8,900 William McGirt $8,700 Scott Piercy $8,500 Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH OUT!!!! 2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Super High End Values  Ryan Moore $10,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: High End Values  Brandt Snedeker $9,800  Kevin Na $9,100  2016 John Deere Classic DraftKings Picks: Second Level Values  Rafa Cabrera-Bello $8,900  William McGirt $8,700  Scott Piercy $8,500  Kevin Kisner $8,300  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Mid-Range Values  Ben Martin $8,000  Jason Dufner $7,900  Billy Horschel $7,600  2016 Wyndham Championship DraftKings Picks: Low-End Values  Luke Donald $7,000  Camilo Villegas $6,400  Roberto Castro $6,000  Seung-Yul Noh $5,600  Rickie Fowler $11,700  Webb Simpson $10,200  Russell Henley $9,000  JB Holmes $8,100  Shane Lowry $7,800  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

7789	7789	1	1	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka, $8600 – The recent U.S. Open breakthrough followed by a month-long hiatus and subsequent tie for 6th at the Open Championship is a worthy trend heading into another high-profile event. Koepka withdrew from last year’s WGC-Bridgestone with an ankle injury, but prior to that in 2015 was sixth at Firestone. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Marc Leishman, $6500 – Leishman is top-20 in both par-4 scoring average and Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, so this week aligns well with his strengths.
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
7689	7689	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
3256	3256	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Jimmy Walker: $7,600  At No. 22 in the Official World Golf Ranking, Jimmy Walker's pedigree should command something higher than a $7,600 salary. He hasn't missed a cut in his past six starts in Houston.
6813	6813	24	25	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.
13161	13161	19	19	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yep, we're definitely in KK country this week and I fully expect to see him up there. Last year, Kisner said: "I just feel like it's a great shot-maker's course. You can be in the fairway and have to carve shots into the pin.
6533	6533	3	4	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Jason Sobel  Jimmy Walker  Just when you thought he was done, Walker gets to return to a course where it has always been feast or famine: two missed cuts (including 2014, the last time he played the tournament), as well as two fourth-place ties and a runner-up to boot. "Sky" Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31.
11494	11494	19	20	target: Thomas Pieters, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a somewhat risky option but is priced modestly given he won the last time he teed it up. Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week.
6050	6050	29	29	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
10396	10396	22	22	target: Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cherry Hills: Winner: Billy Horschel; EW Places: Watson, Hoffmann, Fowler, Palmer. TPC Summerlin: Winner: Ben Martin; EW Places: Streelman, Knox, Simpson, Finau, Piercy. 2015 :  Old White: Winner: Danny Lee; EW Places: Streb, Henley, Hahn.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
5379	5379	20	21	target: Graeme McDowell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s also got the same Vegas odds to win as defending champion, Daniel Berger, nearly $900 more expensive on DraftKings. Graeme McDowell $7,500 – GMac has missed one cut all year and plays Harbour Town in Hilton Head like he built it. We see Harbour Town as a related course to TPC Southwind.
5267	5267	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			24th in strokes gained: total. Charley Hoffman: $6,500  A definite head-scratcher priced this low, Charley Hoffman is 15th on Tour this season in strokes gained: off-the-tee and 29th in strokes gained: tee-to-green. In other words, another solid player here, folks.
7694	7694	1	1	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas, $6,900. His record at Firestone is OK, but Haas has been solid for months up until a missed cut at the Open. He’s in good form and a high finish is right around the corner.
7388	7388	21	21	target: Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
1043	1043	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
4374	4374	10	11	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you grab a Berger this week in tournaments. William McGirt $7,900 – McGirt has some ties with North Carolina, and he’s been in solid form his last two events. He’s another ball striker type that is especially deadly with his irons.
4198	4198	25	25	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The team dynamic was huge, something they analysed and looked back on recently. "We've been mates for a long time and we play good together," Grace told pgatour.com. "Obviously with our history at the Presidents Cup, it's been great and I think this is a good chance to get a win under the belt as a team.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
3958	3958	34	34	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take him each-way at 50/1 to follow in the footsteps of Wesley Bryan and secure a first PGA Tour win. At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s.
613	613	29	29	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey offers some solid cash relief off of the top guys and definitely has shown he can contend with the best in the world. Don’t be shocked if Paul Casey ends up lifting the FedEx Cup trophy come Sunday. Si Woo Kim – $6,700  Since I believe stars and scrubs will be a popular approach to building lineups this week, I think Si Woo Kim will be one of the least popular golfers in the sub $7K range.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
4553	4553	47	47	target: Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season. With that drama now behind him Poulter should be free to “swing freely” at this event, where he’s had some success in the past, including a runner-up finish from 2009. What I like most about Poulter here though is his recent form.
11106	11106	32	33	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  6 - Tiger Woods  4 - Jim Furyk, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Camilo Villegas. 2 - Daniel Berger, Ben Crane, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Fabian Gomez, Russell Henley, Billy Horschel, Chris Kirk, Ryan Palmer, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker.
10293	10293	50	51	target: Jon Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While distance off the tee perhaps isn’t as significant a stat as the first two, it’s still something to consider here as winners have averaged higher in Driving Distance and Strokes Gained: Off the Tee than at other venues (on a whole). Four of the last five winners (Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Scott Stallings and Tiger Woods) all ranked within the top 50 in Driving Distance in the year of their win. Finding Values  Odds to win are one factor to think about when picking players (but not the only thing, so be careful putting too much weight on them).
3239	3239	48	48	target: Peterson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Total Points staked this week: 3  Profit/Loss for 2017: – 36  I have purposely kept stakes to a minimum this week, as I didn’t want to get too involved in this event. Horschel was too obvious to ignore, whilst I have been looking for a chance to back Peterson, and Texas is as arguably the best place to get him on side. Ross Fisher looked like giving us a run for our money last week, only to be knocked out by Hideto Tanihara in the quarter finals.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
1303	1303	9	10	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fabian Gomez: 6th ToC/44th RSM/1st Personal Classic/MC Argentine Open. Jimmy Walker: 2nd ToC/9th Shark Shoot/15th World Challenge/35th HSBC. Jimmy Walker: 21st ToC/44th HSBC/6th CIMB/12th Shriners/1st Fry's.com.
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can’t look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
5062	5062	31	32	target: Stewart Cink. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the last ten winners, eight were ranked inside the top-20 on tour for adjusted scoring average. One name you wouldn’t expect to fit the category based on his odds is Stewart Cink. The former Open Champion is still looking for his first win since his 2009 major but is playing some excellent golf of late.
6050	6050	49	49	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
1261	1261	12	12	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			LETS DO THIS!!!!! NORTH COURSE STACK!!!!! Spaun +8000 Cink +10000 Chesson +10000 Wise +12500 Mullinax +15000 Post… https://t.co/3EHQym9alE
1248	1248	13	13	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And his putting and especially scrambling leave something to be desired. But, like Watson, he's still done well at Kapalua. Jason Dufner - $7,400 (40-1)    Dufner's last visit to the TOC was in 2014, when he tied for fifth.
329	329	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			While the Scot has succeeded on all surfaces, it was a regression toward form that yielded just the singular top 10 in 2017. Kevin Na … It hasn't been a bad season, but it's been his worst while healthy in nine years. It also hasn't been any one thing, so there's a direct relationship between his stats and his production.
10236	10236	5	6	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My selections are as follows:  Jon Rahm 3pts Win 8/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply:  It's the mark of the 23 year-old that Jon Rahm not only attended the CareerBuilder Challenge last week (no doubt ignoring a rather large cheque from Abu Dhabi organisers as a result), but won a tournament which hadn't seen an elite player victorious since Phil Mickelson in 2004. In doing so Rahm, as I mentioned at Kapalua when we were on-board him at 12/1, destroyed a set of well established tournament trends. It's obvious that the World Number 2 is just that kind of phenom who's taking apart well-established trends and records to boot.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week. Yahoo!
6351	6351	2	2	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, Taylor stands out to me in the range of players in the bottom few $100 of salary. Our VIP Spreadsheet shows Taylor gaining strokes to the field Tee-to-Green which is huge anytime you can get a punt play who is doing that. If I need to go low salary wise this week I have no issue filling out some line-ups with Taylor.
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
3688	3688	48	49	target: Branden Grace, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Perhaps remembering the early days of golf betting and the advice of Keith Elliott, I've always tended to back players at Hilton Head who didn't put themselves in the heat of battle at Augusta the week before. And this week's defending champion, Branden Grace, fits the bill. Grace was a nearest-the-finish T27 at Augusta but, rather than view that as a slight disappointment, he was probably relatively pleased given that he'd previously missed his last three cuts at the Masters.
5064	5064	2	3	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 150/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) Whilst his game is in good shape, he could crack the top-10 again and perhaps aim even higher. A veteran of Muirfield Village, he’s made his last 14 cuts at the course with five top-10 finishes.
12469	12469	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course does grade out as a pretty strong fit so maybe, just maybe, he can break out of his massive slump. The Specialists  Retief Goosen  Emiliano Grillo  The specialist this week is Retief Goosen. The South African has flashed some form early in the year but no real consistency.
5822	5822	27	27	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That win was at Royal Aberdeen which I alluded to earlier. Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week.
1278	1278	50	51	target: Jimmy Walker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you don’t roster these guys unless you are playing in the Junkies Season Long Golf League, then by all means feel free to take that goose egg. Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know.
5708	5708	20	21	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rosie’s price tag is too cheap, and he’s consistently overlooked in majors on DraftKings despite a great performance. Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,500 – “Kiz” joined us on the Tour Junkies Podcast this week after seeing Erin Hills and believes that it’s going to come down to keeping it in the fairway off the tee, chipping off these tight lies around the greens, and solid putting. Basically…that’s Kevin Kisner!
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
65	65	13	14	target: Bill Haas’ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8k-9.9k range  This is the range where there looks to be multiple options. Bill Haas’ course form in recent years is bettered only by Simpson. In his last four starts at this course he has finished 6-2-20-7.
1102	1102	11	12	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And this week, he gets the job done. Taras Pitra -- Roberto Castro ($8,200)  Castro has had a really good 2016 season and hasn't missed a cut in about four months. Many will look at his finishing position and price and go elsewhere, but I don't think that's a wise move this week.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
8657	8657	30	43	target: Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Stewart Cink, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Lucas Glover, Brian Harman, Hideki Matsuyama, Jhonattan Vegas. 1 - Keegan Bradley, Bryson DeChambeau, Bill Haas, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Sean O'Hair, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter, Chez Reavie, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Kyle Stanley, Henrik Stenson, Justin Thomas. The BMW Championship, the third leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, has a number of trends that are intriguing.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
4101	4101	23	24	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last eight starts, his WORST finish is T-13, and he has won here. And we give you Adam Hadwin (ballstriker) and Luke Donald, who only played here once, but was T-13 and showed some good form last week. Charley Hoffman, who is money at this event.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
5841	5841	15	16	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, he only has one top 10 in the last five years in this event. Adam Scott – Played the weekend in his last five including finishes of T-9, T-4 and T-18 last year at Oakmont. There aren’t many better in the GIR department, and that’s why the Aussie continues to collect big checks most weeks he tees it up.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
1634	1634	20	21	target: Sam Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What price does T26 in 4 straight tourneys get you on DK? $7,100 is gonna cause some serious ownership on Sam Saunders this week for sure.
10288	10288	6	7	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			WATCH: Is it smart to fade Jon Rahm this week? The Cheat Sheet provides fantasy golf players with course info, golfer history and the most noteworthy trends of the week to help them with their roster selections. The Field  The field this week is 150+ golfers.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
6210	6210	14	15	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are getting firmer and faster and the rough’s not getting any shorter." David Lingmerth : "I was really calm all day. You've really got to golf your ball out here.
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
1247	1247	0	1	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
3681	3681	23	23	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can keep his approach game up and find the green, he’ll have the opportunity to take it down this week. Kyle Stanley ($7200): For whatever reason, Kyle Stanley has been consistently under-priced on DraftKings event after event – all he’s done this season is average 68.25DK points, make 10 of 12 cuts, and finish in the top-25 six times (50%). He’s coming off a T8 at the Shell Houston Open where he hit 79.17% of his greens, which is an example of just one reason to use Stanley this week, his GIR%.
106	106	1	1	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson for one is also hard to ignore at $9,100. Watson has not been at his best this season, but has still not missed a cut and managed to finish 8th in Rio on his last start. He also finished 10th here in 2012 and 18th at the 2009 U.S. Open.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
1021	1021	24	25	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After tying for 66th in his Sea Island debut, has missed the cut in four consecutive starts. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
8836	8836	7	7	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, at 25th in the standings Garcia is in exactly the same position from which Bill Haas scooped the lot with that famous shot out of the lake in 2011. All things considered, Garcia looks a solid alternative to the more fancied runners after controversially sneaking into the field on Sunday night to earn a return to a course which plays to his strengths. Video element not supported Sergio's rocky road to saving par at BMW
13299	13299	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he is priced as the 11th– most expensive player on DK, DailyRoto gives Hatton the fourth-best win probability (2.66%). Putting and short game are going to be a huge factor this week and Hatton is fifth in SG Putting and fourth in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green. This is a steal at just $8,800.
1430	1430	4	5	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Been waiting to roster Paul Casey again https://t.co/psaRoimA3k

7016	7016	42	43	target: Scott Brown, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round.
3994	3994	4	5	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year.
5212	5212	53	53	target: Spieth. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $10,000  The last time we saw Hideki, he finished T22 at The PLAYERS and it seems as though the buzz around Hideki has gone away. Obviously he isn’t the hottest golfer on the planet anymore like he was late in 2016, but he certainly shouldn’t be priced $1,000 less that Spieth. Matsuyama won this event in 2014 and game T5 in 2015 and we are all well aware of his capabilities tee to green.
1815	1815	5	5	target: Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
5159	5159	25	26	target: Billy Horschel, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, he’s done just that the last two years, posting 8-under and 9-under on the par-5s respectively, leading to finishes of T11 and T8. Billy Horschel, $7100 – Recent Byron Nelson champ has two top-15s at Muirfield in three career starts, showcasing a nice blend of recent form and course history. Patrick Cantlay, $6600 – The youngster from UCLA earned his PGA Tour status with a runner-up at the Valspar in March and has gone on to post three top-25s in four starts since.
778	778	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
6544	6544	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
3769	3769	13	14	target: Chad Campbell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Please! Make the cut  Luke List $7,300  Lucas Glover $7,200  Kyle Stanley $7,200  Chad Campbell $7,100  I really don’t think you must dip below $7,000 this week, but of course you can if you choose. I probably won’t.
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
11475	11475	26	27	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
11468	11468	3	3	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous. Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship to close 2017 on the Euro Tour, then opened 2018 by taking the CareerBuilder.
3958	3958	33	34	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take him each-way at 50/1 to follow in the footsteps of Wesley Bryan and secure a first PGA Tour win. At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s.
4984	4984	40	41	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
2223	2223	26	27	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has three top 10s and two missed cuts in a feast-or-famine season thus far, but we expect him to cash a nice check this week. Brooks Koepka ($7,100)  He's never played Riviera as a pro, but we're expecting big things out of Koepka in 2017, and this would be a good week for him to start delivering. Jim Furyk ($6,700)  Still shaking the rust off, but he's finished in the top 25 at Riviera in four straight appearances, including an eighth-place showing in 2015.
7479	7479	3	4	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Open’s runner-up, Matt Kuchar, is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Kuchar has finished inside the top-10 here in each of the past three years the Canadian Open has been played at Glen Abbey: His 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks second in this week’s field. But it’s not just Kuchar’s course history that’s hot like fiya: Kuchar’s 67.4 Recent Adj Rd Score leads the field, thanks in part to six straight finishes of 16th or better, including three finishes of fourth or better.
2601	2601	2	2	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
2599	2599	15	15	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like Mickelson, he's a lot of golfer for $7,500. And averaging 3.75 birdies per round, Kaymer can fill it up. Definitely the biggest upside of anyone in the $7,400-$7,500 range.

5686	5686	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Dufner 2 weeks ago and Bello last week recency bias is real and he could be that guy this week after his missed cut at the St. Jude, which I’m not worried about at all. Middle Range  Paul Casey $8,400 – He currently sits as the second highest rated golfer in my model. Knock on wood he hasn’t missed a cut since I mushed him with my One and Done pick in Hawaii.
5107	5107	11	11	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I really thought I could have got to that magic number." Scott looks a danger on any suitable course right now and this must count as one of them. Take the 25s.
5014	5014	0	1	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
10569	10569	14	15	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he’s playing well again and was T-12 at Farmers last week. Also like: Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
7246	7246	22	23	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I prefer him at 25/1 than out-of-form Rory McIlroy and inexperienced Jon Rahm at 18s. Justin Rose and massively in-form local hero Tommy Fleetwood both have obvious links to Royal Birkdale and should go well at 25/1 and 18s respectively. A bit further down, I like Adam Scott and Branden Grace too.
3223	3223	54	55	target: Phil Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, the Rees Jones design is a par 72 that measures 7,441 yards, which will provide a stern test to all of those teeing it up this week. There are a number of big names in the field this week working on eleventh hour tune-ups for Augusta, including Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Phil Mickelson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Adam Scott and many others. I took last week off from my column (#sorrynotsorry Puerto Rico Open and WGC Match Play), but two weeks ago my picks at the Arnold Palmer Invitational were straight nails as my Driver-off-the-Deck BOLD play of the week on Marc Leishman took home the trophy.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
11974	11974	16	17	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I do not hate the idea of a Day-Noren playoff for the second time this year. Henrik Stenson ($9100) – People will most likely be off of him due to his poor performance last week. It hopefully will not take much to be overweight on Stenson and he has great history (minus last year).
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6207	6207	56	75	target: David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Boo Weekley; 3) Ben Crane; 3) Spencer Levin; 4) Tim Wilkinson; 5) Kyle Stanley; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Jim Herman / Daniel Summerhays; 9) David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Johnson Wagner; 18) Martin Laird / Kyle Reifers; 20) K.J. Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
100	100	18	18	target: Lindheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
13126	13126	8	9	target: Matt Every, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - K.J. Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Fabian Gomez, Billy Horschel, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Davis Love III, Ryan Palmer, Brandt Snedeker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Graeme McDowell, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, John Senden, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Nick Watney.
13249	13249	29	29	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson is one of the most talented souls on tour; just not sure that translates to dividends this week. We do like Riccio's picks of Paul Casey and Zach Johnson, two players whose games mirror past RBC Heritage winners like Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, and Graeme McDowell. Same goes for his picks of Austin Cook (although the Model seemingly chooses Cook every week) and Matt Kuchar (who's won here in the past).
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
3006	3006	41	48	target: J.J. Henry / Martin Flores; 15) J.J. Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Greg Owen; 2) Luke List; 3) Peter Uihlein; 4) D.A. Points; 5) Cameron Percy; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Brad Fritsch / John Peterson / Zack Sucher; 10) Graeme McDowell / Sam Saunders; 12) Tim Wilkinson; 13) J.J. Henry / Martin Flores; 15) J.J. Spaun / Fabrizio Zanotti; 17) Robert Garrigus / Boo Weekley; 19) Sung Kang / Ian Poulter. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Peter Uihlein; 2) Wesley Bryan / Freddie Jacobson / Matt Jones; 5) Graeme McDowell; 6) Thorbjorn Olesen; 7) J.T.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
3396	3396	44	45	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes, he’s on a streak, but he wouldn’t be my choice down to the fade. He is big and strong, which is a help, but even coming off the win, and I think he’s in a happy place, no I’d definitely be sticking with Adam Scott. Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds.
6059	6059	18	19	target: Anirban Lahiri, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Jason Day  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, Paul Casey, Kyle Stanley, Anirban Lahiri, Bud Cauley, Graham DeLaet, Byeong Hun-An  – Chez Reavie, David Lingmerth, Harris English, Derek Fathauer, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Tony Finau  Bets  Kyle Stanley 50-1  Harris English 100-1 EW  Anirban Lahiri 150-1 EW  Derek Fathauer 300-1 EW If the trend continues he’s a good enough putter to really take advantage on a course like this. Fathauer is a player capable of putting together some big rounds, and his approach game showed big improvement his last time out.
7331	7331	11	12	target: Andy Sullivan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's made the cut in four of the past five Opens. Andy Sullivan - $7,000 (100-1)    The Englishman has not had the finest of years, falling from 44th to 66th in the OWGR. But he has played better of late, making his past 10 worldwide cuts, including four-top-20s in his past five starts.
165	165	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
13047	13047	50	50	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you can't quite see Tiger getting it done, a top 5 or top 10 punt could be a very good way of cheering him on. Last four events: 5-2-12-MC  Course form: 17-4-40-4-4-6-2-2-3-1  Last 10 majors: MC-MC-MC-17-MC-69-40-6-32-4  Last 50 starts - Win: 10%, Top 5: 26%, Top 10: 34%    Justin Rose - Place machine looks ready to play  "I really have positive and fond memories of last year. I hit a lot of great shots, and I don't feel like it was a tournament that anybody lost really," said Rose on Monday when reflecting on last year's play-off loss to Sergio Garcia.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
2960	2960	32	33	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson is likely the player with the better floor, although Rory McIlroy has the higher win equity, and I’d lean Rory if forced to choose. Other targets here include Tyrell Hatton, Paul Casey, Thomas Pieters, Kevin Kisner and Marc Leishman  Tournaments: There is a lot of risk/reward types of plays in this field. It’s likely Jason Day will go very under-owned at the top.
1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
12806	12806	2	3	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: T20  Paul Casey 2.5pts EW 22/1 with * For the latest bet365 Opening Account Offer details see below. I'm also into Paul Casey this week. I often overlook him on the basis that he doesn't win nearly enough.

11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
8534	8534	23	24	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Making 10/10 straight cuts Brooks is a great cash play given his price and has shown the upside to win against any field. Tony Finau – DraftKings all formats – DK: $7300 FD: $8300  The price discrepancy is too much to avoid Finau on DraftKings this week. Finau has mad nine straight cuts, finishing inside of the top 50 all nine starts making him extremely viable in cash games at this price.
13056	13056	57	58	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And I've been putting great, so if I can get myself on the greens and give myself the opportunities, hopefully the putter will take over and I can get myself in contention on Sunday. Last four events: 36-22-2-1  Course form: 22-10-28-20-3-WD-2  Last 10 majors: 9-27-MC-22-2-22-8-10-1-4  Last 50 starts - Win: 10%, Top 5: 28%, Top 10: 40%  Phil Mickelson - Tough to discount consistent Lefty  "There's not a course that I feel more comfortable on. The thing about Augusta is that for me personally, I don't feel like I have to be perfect, so it relaxes me.
2908	2908	14	15	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley.

13319	13319	54	56	target: Si Woo Kim, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously I say this with my tongue firmly in my cheek as my reasons for siding with Beau again this week go way beyond any kind of misguided loyalty. No, my main reason for backing Beau again this week is how hugely impressive I felt he was down the stretch in Houston and, unlike Si Woo Kim, until a couple of loose shots in the play off you could lay no fault at Beau’s door for him not taking the trophy home that week. Had this performance come out of the blue I would perhaps have been a bit more cautious but of course Hossler has been talked about as a potentially huge star of the game in the making for a long while now and he has been producing some good stuff on the tour all season without putting four rounds together until it all clicked in Houston.

11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
314	314	37	37	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Field: Top 100 in FedExCup Standings  TPC Boston, Norton, MA  Par 71, 7,216 yards  The Course  This week the FedExCup Playoffs travel to TPC Boston where it has hosted this The Deutsche Bank since 2003. Its Labour Day weekend in The US so this tournament will go from Friday-Monday. It is a par 71 layout with three par 5’s, four par 3’s and 11 par 4’s and has a tendency to give up very low scores.
1476	1476	44	44	target: Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mr Consistency is the lowest-risk call across the $10m+ players this week and is sure to be in the mix at PGA West, coming off a strong putting performance at Waialae. Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut.
2001	2001	15	16	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's finished in the top 15 in three of his last four starts on Tour. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  Lefty's another Pebble Beach ringer (four-time champion and runner-up last year). He's showing signs of a turn-back-the-clock season with top-25 finishes in his last three starts.
4408	4408	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Probably not. But he definitely should be in contention through Sunday… You could swerve on to Ryan Moore here, or eat the chalk with Matt Kuchar, but I’ll be rolling with Walker. A gamble?
2767	2767	0	1	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Brown ($6,700). I don’t think you’ll have to go too deep this week considering the strength of field, but if you want Justin Thomas or Henrik Stenson then Brown is a good option. He’s made eight straight weekends on Tour and was T-7 last year at Innisbrook.
286	286	25	26	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five players to consider adding to your team...  1 Patrick Reed £14.5M  2 Ryan Moore £9.5M  3 Emiliano Grillo £12M  4 Johnson Wagner £5.5M  5 Brandt Snedeker £14M Another option is Brandt Snedeker, despite being disappointing last week we believe he has what it takes to bounce back so make sure he is in your team is your and looking to take good points this week. The Texan finished fourth last year and is good value to have in your team this week.
11206	11206	42	42	target: Anirban 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.

3027	3027	19	19	target: Cejka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 is the year of the Canadians, EH?! Also consider: Peter Uihlein, J.J Spaun, Cameron Percy, David Hearn, Alex Cejka  These core players will garner the most exposure (40%+) in our lineups at the Puerto Rico Open. We will be using these lineups as staples and incorporating some of the deep sleepers you need at low ownership to take down a large GPP.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.

6662	6662	10	11	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For more on List see this week’s PGA Breakdown. Downtown  Scott Brown is tied for 38th in the field with his respectable 70.2 LT Adj Rd Score, but his 69.9 Recent Adj Rd Score speaks to his current form: He has made three of four cuts and finished 12th at THE DEAN & DELUCA Invitational. Brown has shaky history at this event — he’s made only one cut in four starts — but he has a tendency to show up in weaker field events, finishing 17th and scoring 89.5 DraftKings points at the Puerto Rico Open earlier this season.
4131	4131	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Everyone suffered from his missed cut last week. Now, Cink is merely an afterthought heading into the Valero Texas Open. Cink is still having a phenomenal season for his standards, consistently finishing inside the top 30 and making 11 of his last 13 cuts.
1231	1231	3	4	target: Michael Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open: Michael Kim 350/1
5425	5425	29	29	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
6309	6309	33	33	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My only concern is he did not play the similar courses on tour very well this season, but he also wasn’t in good form in general, so I can let that slide. Bud Cauley (DK: $7,700, FD: $7,500)    TPC Potomac seems perfectly suited to Cauley’s game. He isn’t long off the tee but is accurate when he is able to club down.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
4713	4713	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has played this event the past two years and has 12th- and 10th-place finishes to show for it. Honorable Mentions: Jason Day ($10,100) and Brooks Koepka ($10,200)  I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is matt13jones) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on. Although I have expressed my personal view on the games and strategies above, they do not necessarily reflect the view(s) of DraftKings and I may also deploy different players and strategies than what I recommend above.
1600	1600	14	14	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm hoping Stallings' form lasts another week as I'm e/w on him, Henley &amp; Murray (long shot) at the Honda Classic. #golf #bettingtips
11582	11582	16	17	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think most will avoid because of the names around him and last week. Tier 2  Adam Hadwin $7,500 – Another guy who played well at the Genesis. He didn’t play here last year, but I like what I saw a couple weekends ago.
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
6495	6495	19	20	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGATOUR.COM fantasy columnist Rob Bolton lists his five against-the-grain selections for this week's event at the Old White TPC. Scott Brown … Back in action after a three-week break that supplanted seven straight weeks of competition. He hit that road trip running with a playoff loss teaming with Kevin Kisner in New Orleans.
9716	9716	0	1	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week. Thomas for a second-straight week will serve as defending champion, but don’t let last week’s performance scare you away. Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week.
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
10817	10817	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Its pretty much the antithesis to last week’s event from a TV standpoint. Golfers to Consider:  $16,000+  Dustin Johnson ($17,100)  The best player on the planet, there’s just no questioning it. Off the tee, he’s going to be in position to score almost every single time.
2813	2813	21	22	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect Na to be in contention on Sunday just like he was in 2014 when he finished solo second. Taras Pitra: Graham DeLaet ($8,400)  It's tough to ignore what he's been doing this year (10th, 17th, 9th, 54th). Being ranked near the top of the tour in putting is the main reason we're seeing him near the top of the leaderboard.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
3220	3220	0	1	target: Peter Uihlein: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein: Come on dude, just get over to the PGA Tour already. Since coming back from injury on the European Tour, Uihlein has been tearing it up, and his success translated quite well last week, putting him pretty close to contention for the win. He’s very, very talented and could be a force if he decides to make the Brooks Koepka transition back to the states.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.

Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Henrik Stenson; 2) Paul Casey; 3) Gary Woodland; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Chad Campbell; 6) Rickie Fowler / Ben Martin; 8) Graham DeLaet; 9) Jason Dufner / Russell Henley; 11) Francesco Molinari; 12) Jordan Spieth; 13) Ollie Schniederjans; 14) Charley Hoffman; 15) Tony Finau; 16) J.J.

11467	11467	35	36	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why it is so hard to bypass Justin Thomas, who actually was leading the tournament after three rounds a year ago, a shot ahead of Johnson, but faded to a 1-over 72. Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous.
6324	6324	16	17	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently. Zac Blair ($7000) – On any course where accuracy matters more than distance, Blair has to be considered; the little Mormon hits 68.85% of fairways (15 th ) but struggles with longer distances – luckily with long approach shots (above 200), he’s 46 th on Tour and 20 th from 200-225. He’s not without his flaws, but he gains strokes on the greens, scores very well on par-3s (four of them on this course) and averages only 4.02 on par-4s.  )
5360	5360	37	37	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
5786	5786	12	162	target: Justin Rose in a playoff.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
11180	11180	26	27	target: Ryan Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take your shots where you feel confident, especially if a guy is known to play well in Florida but hasn’t performed in the past few outings. Ryan Palmer ($7.3K) – I am a supporter of Team Palmer this year and will likely be firing him up anytime he is under $8K this year until he wins. So, like I said, I’m not biased.
10377	10377	17	17	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kizzire is also the only player to have played 29 rounds or more and rank higher than Spaun in Par 4 Scoring Average, so this test looks to be right up Spaun’s alley this week. His T4 finish here 12 months ago was one of four top-10’s Spaun posted in 2017, with two of them coming at the start of this wrap-around season. He has finished inside the top-23 in 50% of his starts this season, with just two missed cuts, so a pretty successful start to the season overall.
6606	6606	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can be tilting to follow live so I don’t recommend watching every shot. However, at this price Finau can allow you to avoid having to punt in cash games. Danny Lee ($16,400) – A former winner at this event, Danny Lee is riding a hot streak.
4157	4157	4	5	target: Ryan Moore: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Ryan Moore: $10,200  It's tough to pay the premium for a Kuchar or a Koepka this week. Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year.
11569	11569	29	30	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As for the weather, expect near-perfect scoring conditions with sunny skies for a majority of the week, high temperatures reaching 80 degrees and very little wind. Past Champions    2017- Dustin Johnson  2016 - Adam Scott  2015 - Dustin Johnson  2014 - Patrick Reed  2013 - Tiger Woods  2012 - Justin Rose  2011 - Nick Watney  2010 - Ernie Els  2009 - Phil Mickelson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Dustin Johnson - $17,900    The defending champion was victorious at the inaugural WGC-Mexico Championship held at the Club de Golf Chapultepec last year, and he’s maintained the No. 1 spot in the OWGR ever since.
9969	9969	2	2	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Jon Rahm – All Formats – DK: $11800 FD: $12500  It seems almost unfair to write about picking the top player in the field but there is no way I can shy away from Rahm this week. Despite being the clear favourite of the field Jon Rahm’s price is not overly inflated and he is only a few hundred more than the second price players (Harman and Phil(why?)) on DraftKings and FanDuel respectively.
10986	10986	13	14	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be decently low owned with all the names in this range. Bubba Watson $7,800 – Pretty good price for a guy who has won here twice. He is getting some form back, so I will try and hop on before he is super chalk.
10252	10252	12	13	target: Jhonattan Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like Brendan in cash or GPP lineups. Embed from Getty Images  Jhonattan Vegas $7,700 – Jhonny V is in tremendous form coming off a solid week at the CareerBuilder where he continued making birdies in bunches. Like Steele, he’s gained 19 strokes on the field in the last five years at Torrey Pines.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
2188	2188	28	29	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
2601	2601	1	2	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
11363	11363	6	7	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
3673	3673	0	1	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Luke Donald ($7,800) – Donald’s certainly not a guy we rely on week to week, but at certain spots, he’s just ridiculous – this one of them. Since 2009, Donald has carded four (4) runner-up finishes along with two third-place finishes. It’s not hard to understand why with his particular skill set, but no matter how little you’d normally trust him, this is the spot to set that aside.
8189	8189	20	20	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The FSU album is one of the best iron players in the game over the last 12-24 rounds he’s played. Berger has played Quail Hollow twice including no missed cuts and a Top 25. This is a bomber’s course and Berger has the length to compete and win.
383	383	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jason Day  Vegas Odds - 8/1  Draftkings - $12,500  FantasyAces - $6,200  What stood out to me more than anything last week was how awful Jason Day was off the tee(35% Driv Acc and ranked 72nd in SG:OTT) yet he was still able to finish T4 shooting a seven under par. Despite having to hit out of the rough for the majority of the four days he still had close to a 70% GIR(ranked T19) and led the field in SG:Putting.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him.

5299	5299	56	57	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World top 20 players in the form of Dustin Johnson and Lee Westwood have won this tournament in recent years, but so have Tour maidens Daniel Berger (33/1), Fabian Gomez (400/1), Harris English (66/1) and Harrison Frazar (275/1). This week the field includes Rickie Fowler (OWGR No.9), Adam Scott (No.12), Francesco Molinari (No.16), Charl Schwartzel (No.21), Brooks Koepka (No.22) and Phil Mickelson (No.23) who has decided to give next week's U.S. Open a miss. All in all though, it's traditionally one of the weaker tournaments on the PGA Tour schedule and offers a big opportunity for those whose game fits TPC Southwind.
10952	10952	21	22	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brandon Harkins $6,800 – I could see him being the highest owned guy below $7,000, but he is playing very well. Adam Hadwin $7,100 – He is interesting to me because he has made 3 straight cuts here and hasn’t missed one on Tour since late August. Will probably go largely overlooked.
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
2270	2270	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele comes here in much better form than he did last year and looks great value to keep up his good run of form here. Keegan Bradley 80/1  I was quite surprised to see Keegan Bradley at such a big price this week considering the form he’s in. He finished 2016 with three top 15’s in four events finishing solo sixth at the CIMB Classic, T7 at The Shriners Open and a T15 at the OHL Classic.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
232	232	35	36	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.

10435	10435	0	1	target: Jon Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, $12200 – After a double-bogey late Saturday crippled his weekend, Rahm should be hungry to return to his otherwise high-performing self near his alma mater Arizona State. Rahm is among the world’s best from tee to green, as evidenced by him finishing third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green last season. Rickie Fowler, $11900 – The flashy Fowler has lived up to his hype at the electric TPC Scottsdale, finishing fourth and second the last two years.

6401	6401	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chez Reavie is three for three here, too: T18 in 2011, T62 in 2013, and T22 in 2015. Graham DeLaet has made all four cuts at the Greenbrier (T45 in 2010, T12 in 2012, T30 in 2013, and T37 in 2015). Kevin Na has also made all four cuts of his Greenbrier career: T36 in 2010, T7 in 2012, T52 in 2014, and T32 in 2015.
1063	1063	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar. It's easy to wait on Kuchar since he's so consistent week-to-week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
51	51	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lipsky &amp; Canizares in Switzerland and Reed and Woodland in the US for me this week. #golf #betting #tips
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
5455	5455	15	15	target: Cink: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints. Stewart Cink: $8,000  Cink arrives on the strength of top-25 finishes in three of his last four starts. He’s never missed the cut at the FedEx St. Jude.
1017	1017	16	17	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ.

3811	3811	36	37	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Morgan Hoffmann ($7,000): With local ties to the area and a recent career-best at the Honda Classic, Hoffmann has a lot of potential but I'm keeping on the front end since he's not the safest option. Jason Dufner ($8,300): Is playing steady golf this season. He's been inside the top 30 thru 36 holes in 9 of his last 10 starts, so you know where I'll be placing him this week.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
11165	11165	14	15	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why scrambling is so important this week. last year, Rickie Fowler and co-runners-up Gary Woodland and Morgan Hoffmann all finished top-10 in scrambling. The year before, the top-8 finishers were all top-12 in scrambling.
1290	1290	18	19	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Focus aggressively on tee-to-green excellence and you will most likely be rewarded in kind. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Paul Casey ($9,500) – I am honestly at a loss for why Paul Casey is priced this generously, but I never look a gift horse in the mouth. Casey has been absolutely terrific in virtually every phase of the game, and should be absolutely dominant on a course that is hardly as demanding as the vast majority of elite-tier events he plays.
7740	7740	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/5 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brooks Koepka 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (5 places EW, 1/4 odds):  Jordan Spieth arrives at another strict ball-striking test as the bookies favourite this week and after riding his luck and putting incredibly well at the end to win The Open Championship a fortnight ago at Royal Birkdale, whether he can repeat that feat here remains to be seen. Firestone South isn't the best fit to Spieth's game, however the same could be said of the Southport links and we all saw what happened there.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
11505	11505	28	29	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On that note, Casey ranks 6th in the field in DK scoring putting him just below favorites like DJ, Rahm, and JT but at a much cheaper value. Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself.

1565	1565	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up! Paul Casey ($19,000, Mostly GPP) – Did you get burned by Paul Casey last week like I did? Yeah, it was rough, but buried in the sadness and anger over his missed cut was the fact that it was almost entirely on account of a legendarily bad putting performance, and one that is not characteristic of Casey.
2022	2022	34	34	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Fiction. First, the only reason you could question Spieth’s recent performances is because he hasn’t won since the Dean and Deluca Invitational last year. And I get it – if Jordan is going to be the highest-priced player every week he tees it up, you really do want him to win.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.

PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week.

10543	10543	9	10	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the short list of truths to be self-evident, Hideki Matsuyama at the Waste Management Phoenix Open appears. No, the history doesn't predict the present, but we compete in an imperfect fantasy world. This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident.
577	577	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will.
11765	11765	2	2	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style.

7022	7022	14	14	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this cheap price tag, Luck is the perfect GPP play this week. Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.

5228	5228	21	21	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week. Adam Hadwin – $7,600  Adam Hadwin was heavily owned last week, and even though he didn’t miss the cut, he certainly didn’t win anyone money. Hadwin only has six tags on FanShareSports, clearly showing people have already moved on.
108	108	7	8	target: Brett Stegmaier 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shriner's Open bets: E/W Adam Hadwin 125-1 Brett Stegmaier 300-1 FRL Ricky Barnes 125-1
2113	2113	36	36	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This season he is still losing strokes to the field but it’s getting better and he might get away with it at Riviera; his record at the course is MC-2-16-20-4-MC losing in a playoff in 2012. Bradley strength has always been tee-to-green and that department is working well again. He recently finished T4 at Torrey Pines, another demanding layout and has six top-25s in just eight starts this season.
2393	2393	17	18	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Great price, cash worthy. Economy  Billy Horschel $7,200  Nick Watney $7,100  Kyle Stanley $7,100  Martin Flores $7,100  Stewart Cink $7,100  That’s it for this week. I think it is a great week to focus on cash games and build some bankroll.
282	282	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
12874	12874	59	59	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The prudent move will be to take him out of your lineups completely, however some people enjoy a higher degree of risk and will hope that his ankle is fine.

5226	5226	9	10	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Jason Dufner – $8,700  Duf-man was a very popular pick last week at the Dean and Deluca. He was highly owned across all formats and even in one and done pools.
6628	6628	20	21	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because of that dynamic, ownership levels are projected to be fairly even among many of the high-priced guys. Not until James Hahn at $8,800 on DraftKings — he has the 14th-highest salary in the field — do we find someone projected for potential single-digit ownership at nine to 12 percent. Sung Kang is the first golfer below that; he’s $8,600 and is currently projected for five to eight percent ownership.
890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
197	197	142	143	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
4330	4330	0	1	target: Shane Lowry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry … Let's try this again. His last appearance on this page was for the Masters but his putter didn't cooperate as was the need. Four weeks later, strong putting is neutralized in the context of unfamiliar surfaces.
8334	8334	26	27	target: Trey Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watney feels like more of a GPP play, but if you’re playing in large cash game contests, we wouldn’t mind the move. Best bargain basement option:  Trey Mullinax $6,900 – Mullinax doesn’t necessarily fit the profile for Sedgefield from a stats perspective since he’s a bomb and gouge type guy. However, Trey is a sneaky good putter and proved that all year last year on the Web.com tour.
8214	8214	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone? Jamie Lovemark (150-1): Seems to be made for majors this season – T-27 at U.S. Open and T-22 at British Open this year.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!

828	828	14	14	target: WEBB 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
5459	5459	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
3829	3829	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Brit returns to action at arguably his best course. Donald has never won at Harbour Town, but he has four runner-ups and two thirds. Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well.
1522	1522	0	0	target: CHOI 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CHOI has an impeccable record at Riviera. https://t.co/iNGBsDFpIs
2357	2357	1	1	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays. Grace is also 37th in greens in regulation percentage. There’s also the fact seven of the last nine winners of the Honda Classic weren’t from the United States.
9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.
570	570	5	6	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5. Emiliano Grillo - $6,900  6.
2603	2603	27	27	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
4739	4739	1	1	target: Kang 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sung Kang – $7,400  Why not make it two consecutive wins for South Koreans? Even without the Si Woo Kim bump, Sung Kang would have been a fantastic play this week, as he enters the Byron Nelson with second best recent form other than DJ. Kang has quietly recorded four top 11 finishes in his last five events.
12704	12704	54	55	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is also live coverage on BBC2 on Saturday and Sunday, and they also have Red Button coverage from mid-afternoon over the weekend, showing featured groups, Amen Corner, and holes 15 and 16. Last Ten Winners  2017 - Sergio Garcia -9 (playoff)  2016 - Danny Willett -5  2015 - Jordan Spieth -18  2014 - Bubba Watson -8  2013 - Adam Scott -9 (playoff)  2012 - Bubba Watson -10 (playoff)  2011 - Charl Schwartzel -14  2010 - Phil Mickelson -16  2009 - Angel Cabrera -12 (playoff)  2008 - Trevor Immelman -8  What Will it Take to Win the US Masters? Sergio Garcia's stats were incredible last year and it's hardly surprising he won.
4041	4041	16	17	target: Rafael Campos 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			GPP ONLY. Prairie Dogs  Cameron Percy $6,800  Luke List $7,600  Xander Schauffele $6,500  JT Poston $6,900  Rafael Campos $6,200  Jamie Lovemark $7,200  We have a standard field of 156 and a standard cut of Top 70 and ties so I’ll be playing all game types. This field is weak comparatively speaking so I’m going to scale back some and probably go after the weekend slate again.
10717	10717	22	22	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why top-25s are good -- he's got four of them here in the past five years, two of them being top-10s. Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home.
12014	12014	1	1	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
2968	2968	6	6	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Among other usual suspects are Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Brandt Snedeker and defending champion Jason Day. Rose sets up similarly to Stenson and would be my pick if Molinari wasn't available. I'd go on to gush more, but the reasoning would only further push you into plugging in the Englishman.
10732	10732	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.

13621	13621	64	65	target: Tommy Fleetwood; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) John Senden; 3) Emiliano Grillo / Kyle Stanley; 5) Keegan Bradley; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Daniel Berger; 8) Ryan Blaum; 9) Adam Hadwin / Brian Harman; 11) Alex Cejka / Tommy Fleetwood; 13) Jonathan Randolph; 14) Andrew Landry; 15) Kevin Kisner; 16) Vaughn Taylor; 17) Fabian Gomez / Alex Noren / Ted Potter Jnr / Webb Simpson / Kevin Streelman.

8192	8192	10	11	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s another GPP and Cash staple for us this week. Tony Finau $7,000 – Like Berger, Finau has played Quail Hollow twice without missing a cut and landing one T25. He’s another big hitter that has played quite well in major championships including a Top-10 in the 2015 PGA Championship.

13525	13525	8	9	target: Abraham Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List). His form is outstanding and he’s gaining a lot of his strokes with impeccable ball striking from tee to green.
10563	10563	16	16	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh. Webb Simpson, Brendan Steele and Ryan Moore line up as safety nets if you're in the same position as our resident Aussie.
4150	4150	22	22	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
10732	10732	27	27	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
6042	6042	45	46	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We saw Kevin Streelman win here by shooting 64-64 on the weekend, including a finish of seven consecutive birdies. Relying on recent stats, the field leaders in SGP are Steve Wheatcroft, Justin Thomas, Jim Herman, Julian Etulain, Jason Day, Greg Chalmers, Kevin Streelman, Whee Kim, Brandt Snedeker, and Bubba Watson. Birdie or Better % (BoB%): There are not many weeks where we aren’t going to target birdie or better percentage because that’s what fantasy golf scoring is all about.
3618	3618	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
6525	6525	11	12	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kokrak could be dangerous if he gets the flat stick rolling. Stewart Cink - $14,100    The 44-year-old veteran just continues to be under-priced, despite climbing to 53rd in the FedExCup standings with 13 top-30s in 20 events this season. Over his past 12 rounds, he’s 12th among the field in SG: T2G, 11th in SG: Approach and 14th in SG: Putting.
483	483	16	17	target: Shawn Stefani, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
10256	10256	30	30	target: Steele, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Embed from Getty Images  Jhonattan Vegas $7,700 – Jhonny V is in tremendous form coming off a solid week at the CareerBuilder where he continued making birdies in bunches. Like Steele, he’s gained 19 strokes on the field in the last five years at Torrey Pines. He’s another West Coast guy familiar with these green surfaces.
1196	1196	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 - Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth. 2 - Jason Dufner, Fabian Gomez, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Aaron Baddeley, Daniel Berger, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, James Hahn, Charley Hoffman, Si Woo Kim, Pat Perez, Brian Stuard, Jhonattan Vegas, Bubba Watson.
10351	10351	24	24	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given his comfort in the area, I wouldn't be worried about any fatigue issues. I am considering him the man to beat this week.While Rahm brings form and area knowledge, Matsuyama is the man to beat when it comes to course history at TPC Scottsdale. In four trips, he's rattled off finishes of T4, T2, WIN, WIN!
10224	10224	127	128	target: Jon Rahm; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation: 1) Billy Horschel; 2) Kevin Streelman; 3) Justin Rose; 4) Francesco Molinari; 5) Rickie Fowler; 6) Kyle Stanley; 7) Hideki Matsuyama; 8) Brendan Steele; 9) Lucas Glover; 10) Keegan Bradley / Patrick Cantlay / Brian Harman / Gary Woodland; 14) Charley Hoffman / J.J.

4730	4730	30	30	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament. Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him.
320	320	2	2	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @Thomas_Pieters at 80/1 in the @WGCMexico. Pieters was second at Riviera recently and this course may share some similarities
5706	5706	14	14	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s another lock in cash or GPP contests on DraftKings. Best bargain basement option:  Jimmy Walker $6,500 – We’re going out on a limb a little bit with Jimmy here, but we like the value and likely the low ownership in DraftKings GPPs. Jimmy has already shown he can perform in majors with three tops 10’s and a victory at the PGA Championship just last year.
6620	6620	36	37	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For that reason, it’s probably wise to ignore ownership for players above $8,500: Simply take the best golfers and find contrarian plays with cheaper salaries. Some intriguing golfers at the top of the salary range are Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, and Tony Finau. Haas has been on an impressive streak of late, posting four straight top-25 finishes; his 67.5 Recent Adj Rd is the second-best mark in the field only behind Howell’s 66.8.
1615	1615	7	7	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a laidback character and so is Swafford so I don't expect a huge emotional reaction to his win. Asked about how he felt after the victory, Swafford said: "Not so much relief, but maybe a little bit, just of getting in contention a number of times lately and finally being comfortable with it and just executing some great shots down the stretch. Really hit some good ones coming in    "I've been in the last few groups the last few tournaments and had chances and hadn't got it done."
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
2074	2074	4	5	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Do not fade them. Sergio Garcia ($9,300) – Outside of a missed cut here last year, few players have embraced the challenge of Riviera like Sergio. He is one of the absolute best ball strikers on the planet with surgical precision when he’s locked into his game, and based on the fact he just shipped the Dubai Desert a few weeks back, I would say that he’s feeling pretty good.
3393	3393	12	13	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts.
196	196	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bethpage is a lengthy 7,468-yard par 71 and although we have scant evidence to go on - the 2002 and 2009 US Opens along with this event in 2012 - it's easy to spot plenty of big hitters amongst the respective top 10s. Reed biffs it just a few yards short of 300 off the tee and that puts him in the top 50 in Driving Distance. He's about much more than that though as shown by his ninth spot in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green.
327	327	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
8886	8886	12	13	target: Bronson Burgoon 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His balanced attack isn't sexy, but it and his grit have soul. Bronson Burgoon … Rest and recovery from wrist surgery sidelined him for nearly 10 months, but when he returned to action early this summer, it proved to be worth the wait. He recorded a pair of top 25s among six cuts made in eight starts in advance of the Web.com Tour Finals during which he competed on a special medical exemption.
9017	9017	29	29	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is one of the best birdie makers in the field and giving the fact that he is guaranteed 72 holes, He is a must play in all formats. Woodland turned his 2017 season around at the end of the year and will look to keep the momentum going into the 2018 season. It’s been a few years since Woodland has found success in Malaysia, but he had a runner up finish in 2014 and 2013.
413	413	65	65	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He talks about his 1st Masters experience and the impact of Draft Kings and Fantasy Free View in iTunes  139 Clean WGC Cadillac 2016 W/ PGATour Caddie Paul Tesori PGATour Caddie, Paul Tesori talks about life on Tour, caddying for Webb Simpson, caddie preparation, and the Tesori Family Foundation on this week's episode.

11433	11433	20	20	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a much deserved week off, Rahm is back and priced as the third highest golfer. WIth DJ, JT and Fleetwood creating all the buzz at the top, Rahm is getting overlooked. He only has seven tags on FanShareSports, despite his T3 finish here last year.
1651	1651	17	17	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA DFS T10 Model 1. Fleets 2. Hatton 3. JT 4. Noren 5. Rory 6. CH3 7. Sergio 8. Woodland 9. Hadley 10. Kaymer
807	807	3	3	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Anyone else feeling Grillo this week? I think this might be the big boys man party ive been predicting hes gonna crash very soon #ThePlayers
3834	3834	24	25	target: Russell Henley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
720	720	17	17	target: Kim. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Better than feeling bad... All the An and Kang this week with a sprinkle of Lee and Kim. #TeamKorea https://t.co/TCc8MHOJgR
5266	5266	15	15	target: Finau: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully, an off week at The Players will drive Dick Fowler, P.I.’s ownership down. Tony Finau: $7,900  Finau has played the Memorial twice and hasn’t finished worse than 11th. He arrives having finished 30th-or-better in five of his last seven starts.
12268	12268	38	39	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whether it be in the Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, EurAsia Cup or this event itself, match-play form is match-play form and needs to be taken into account. Market Leaders  Rory McIlroy (8/1)  Dustin Johnson (9/1)  Justin Thomas (12/1)  Jason Day (14/1)  Jon Rahm (14/1)  No prizes for working out the favourites this week, as they wrote themselves before the prices came out. Rory edges Johnson for favouritism thanks to his heroics at Bay Hill this past Sunday, whilst fellow former winner, Jason Day also features in the top-5.
7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
8830	8830	6	6	target: Garcia. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top of my list is Sergio Garcia. You may recall that Garcia won the Masters in the spring, and this will be his first subsequent visit to Georgia. That alone puts him on the shortlist as he bids to cap the most memorable year of his life, one which also saw him marry Angela Akins.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
3960	3960	17	17	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s. Koepka admitted he lost his game for a while this season but the 27-year-old came back to form by making the knockout stage of the WGC-Dell Match Play. The next test of his well-being was the Masters and Koepka proved he really was on the right track again by finishing T11, his best ever finish there.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
8528	8528	18	19	target: Ollie Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He hasn’t played up to his standards of late, but this price is great for this scoring ability. Ollie Schniederjans $8,100 – I think this price will keep some people off the guy who finished second in last week’s score fest. He is hitting greens at an amazing clip, I think he figured how something with his putting and he scrambled well last week.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
1100	1100	3	3	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: B Gay 125/1, B Stuard 125/1, W Kim 250/1, C Campbell 250/1, M Hoffmann 250/1, C Conners 300/1
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
98	98	3	3	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
8415	8415	64	65	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Hideki Matsuyama; 2) Brooks Koepka; 3) Jason Day; 4) Matt Kuchar; 5) Paul Casey / Xander Schauffele; 7) Rickie Fowler; 8) Justin Thomas; 9) Sung Kang / Grayson Murray; 11) Charley Hoffman; 12) Daniel Berger / Jordan Spieth; 14) Jonas Blixt / Robert Streb; 15) D.A. Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 .
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
10976	10976	22	23	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
6189	6189	11	11	target: Haas… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another top 30 should be in the cards this week. Bill Haas… If we think distance is muted this week, than Haas becomes a major factor on my board. With top 25s in each of his last three starts, he’s definitely worth a look.
12495	12495	40	41	target: Phil Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another event that may be worth looking at closely, and another event that Fowler has traded at odds-on in before getting beat, is the Phoenix Open, staged at TPC Scottsdale. Holmes is a two-time winner there, the 2011 Houston winner, Phil Mickelson, has won there three times, and Hunter Mahan has also taken both titles in the last eight years. Huge outsider, Mark Wilson, the Phoenix Open winner in 2011, was in-the-mix at halfway here three years ago and so was Graham DeLaet, who traded at odds-on in Phoenix four years ago.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
11432	11432	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood – $10,000  All aboard the Fleetwood train…once again. Make it three straight weeks of being in on Fleetwood and I apologize for being repetitive, but when a world class ball striker is affordable and a good course fit, he becomes a “jam him in” play. Fleetwood gained 6.1 strokes on approach shots at the Honda Classic last week, something we should start getting use to.
8534	8534	24	24	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Making 10/10 straight cuts Brooks is a great cash play given his price and has shown the upside to win against any field. Tony Finau – DraftKings all formats – DK: $7300 FD: $8300  The price discrepancy is too much to avoid Finau on DraftKings this week. Finau has mad nine straight cuts, finishing inside of the top 50 all nine starts making him extremely viable in cash games at this price.
11789	11789	22	23	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Showing signs of life recently, I'm going to try to jump aboard before the masses jump back on the Texan. DraftKings Picks:    Henrik Stenson ($10,200): Don't have to pay a premium for the Orlando resident that has finished T11 or better in all three visits to the Valspar. Matt Kuchar ($8,200): Should see his ownership plummet after a poor putting performance in Mexico.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!

3113	3113	19	20	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T15 here last year and he’s made three straight cuts coming in, including a T17 last weekend. Scott Brown ($9,800) – It’s tough for me to go against Scott Brown at this tournament. He has a win here, two T5s and a T10 in five tries (with no missed cuts).
10065	10065	22	23	target: Jon Rahm. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, the cut occurring after Rd 3 will mean birdies and eagles are even more valuable to take down a contest. Enter Jon Rahm. Don’t get cute.
937	937	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6. Alex Cejka - $7,300  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!

353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
10541	10541	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate teams are no fun and don't help anyone. FanDuel Picks:    Zach Johnson ($10,600): He's fully synced up with his latest equipment from PXG. Typically runs hot or cold, so I will keep riding the hot streak while it's here.
10724	10724	21	21	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home. He's finished top-25 here the last three years, and all that's gotten him is a $1,000 drop in price over last year.
13519	13519	4	4	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Avoid him in cash. Grayson Murray $7,300 – If you’re looking for a bomber who can score and look like an idiot on social media, Grayson is your guy! The form is ok, but the scoring potential and length will be an asset at TPC San Antonio.

6965	6965	76	77	target: Rory Sabbatini; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
11764	11764	12	13	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Army Pricing – Use code PGA for 10% off membership! Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since.
8862	8862	64	64	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has been playing some good golf lately and I look forward to seeing him play this week. He is a guy that has burned me more times than he has helped me out in Draftkings, but I have a feeling that a lot of other people will feel the same way and hopefully pivot to someone else in his price range like Kuchar, Garcia, Simpson, Reed, Hoffman, or Finau. I wouldn't call him a "core" player but he's the kind of guy you could see at the top of the leaderboard on Thursday and beat yourself up all weekend for not playing him.
5385	5385	14	14	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We love the value the $7,500 price tag brings in this weak field. Peter Uihlein $7,200 – Uihlein is a total stud! He’s a bomber that excels in SG: Off the Tee and scores birdies and eagles in bunches.
4158	4158	10	11	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Off since a top-10 finish at the Masters, perennially steady Ryan Moore finished eighth in his only appearance at TPC San Antonio (2012). Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year.
3628	3628	25	26	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cold weather means shorter shots, which seem to help level the playing field. Also, we’ve done a lot of digging, especially looking at players like Bill Haas and Ryan Moore. Players who make a lot of cuts here.
385	385	17	17	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here. Everything is trending in the right direction for Day.
6982	6982	24	25	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His success was built around impressive iron play and that will mean success this week – oh and he was 8th here last season. Scott Brown 1 point each way at 80/1 with Bet On Brazil – The American has had an odd year, with two runner-up finishes and another top 10 but has also missed the cut on eight occasions. Has finished 5th and 16th here in the past – like his chances this week.
1810	1810	9	10	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Brooks Koepka – $9,100  Last week at Torrey Pines, people piled up on the bombers with Brooks Koepka being one of them. He disappointed a lot of DFSers with a missed cut and now finds himself at a price with plenty of other good options right below him.
5942	5942	36	37	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To make things even more appetizing, Thomas tied for third at last year’s Travelers and will look to break through for his fifth career win, and first on the U.S. mainland. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts.
9983	9983	25	25	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's jump in and take a look at this weeks tag counts. $10K Range  The top tier is small with just five golfers but Rahm, Harman, and Mickelson lead the way in the tag count with Rahm sitting with a commanding lead in start recommendations. I will have the most exposure to Mickelson in this tier but think there is a nice pivot opportunity with Patrick Reed.
3675	3675	54	90	target: Adam Scott ($8,800) – T9 Jon Rahm ($8,600) – T27 Justin Rose ($9,200) – 2 Paul Casey ($7,800) – 6 Russell Henley ($7,200) – T11 Phil Mickelson ($8,700) – T22 Hedge (Minority of Cash Lines) Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			E-Mail Exclusive Picks (FREE, sign up for our newsletter to receive it as well as exclusive discount codes!) SHELL HOUSTON OPEN RECAP  FireDFS Cash Plays from Investment Guide  Must Play  Brandt Snedeker ($8,000) – T27  Rickie Fowler ($9,300) – T11  Majority of Cash Lines  Tyrrell Hatton ($7,600) – MC  Kevin Kisner ($6,900) – T43  Adam Scott ($8,800) – T9  Jon Rahm ($8,600) – T27  Justin Rose ($9,200) – 2  Paul Casey ($7,800) – 6  Russell Henley ($7,200) – T11  Phil Mickelson ($8,700) – T22  Hedge (Minority of Cash Lines)  Adam Hadwin ($6,900) – T36  Lee Westwood ($7,200) – T18  Tommy Fleetwood ($6,900) – MC  Jhonattan Vegas ($6,700) – MC  Chris Wood ($6,500) – MC  Brendan Steele ($7,100) – T27  Well, aside from a disastrous performance by Tyrrell Hatton, our week was looking pretty rosy post-cut Friday. We had Rickie, Rose, Casey, Phil, Scott, Rahm, Henley, Sneds, and Spieth all looking rather sharp.
6828	6828	25	26	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Either way his play before last week was very solid and I know he burned some people, which usually translates to low ownership. Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies.
767	767	8	8	target: Pettersson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Have made initial bets on Webb, Haas, &amp; Pettersson due to course familiarity, but want to wait on rest w/forecast a… https://t.co/ROSZbJI7Te
4652	4652	35	36	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course features plenty of sand so we don’t want our core players to be hacking away from the sand. Past Winners  2016 Sergio Garcia  2015 Steven Bowditch  2014 Brendon Todd  2013 Bae Sang-moon  2012 Jason Dufner  2011 Keegan Bradley  2010 Jason Day  Weather  The weather looks as if we could see some rain in the forecast. This will be important to monitor as a couple years ago the rain turned the course into a Par 69.
5740	5740	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said, the USGA set up each year is often quite similar, so looking back at who has had success at this event over their career is at least worth reviewing. Jason Day has played in the U.S. Open six times and only finished outside of the top-10 once. He has runner-up finishes from both 2011 at Congressional and 2013 at Merion.
6292	6292	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
9786	9786	8	8	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside. A ball-striking and long-iron extraordinaire, Wise is better on approaches the further he is from the hole. Get him next to the green, and he’ll struggle.
7226	7226	28	29	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose. Yeah, it’s maybe too corny to happen.
4921	4921	99	100	target: Phil Mickelson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They don't appear to correlate visually but all three venues reward excellent ball striking and short games and form at the three courses crosses over really well...  David Toms, Kenny Perry, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson and Jordan Spieth have all recently won this title and the John Deere Classic, staged at Deere Run in Illinois and Brandt Snedeker and Tim Clark have both finished runner-up at both tournaments. Johnson has won this title twice recently so of the eight men to win the last eight editions, four have also won the US Masters - Johnson, Spieth, Adam Scott and Phil Mickelson. Is There an Identikit Winner?
11469	11469	21	21	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous. Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship to close 2017 on the Euro Tour, then opened 2018 by taking the CareerBuilder. The biggest detriment to Rahm's success is his temperament.
4077	4077	12	12	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure List make your list among value plays this week. JJ Spaun $7,800 – Spaun is a Web.com graduate, making a huge impact on the PGA Tour in his first season. He gains strokes off the tee and makes a ton of birdies.
3862	3862	7	7	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a steal at $7,200 on DraftKings. Stanley consistently proves to be low-owned as he’s not the sexiest pick around, but he has potential to land a top 10 or even win this event. Love him in cash or GPP contests.
1559	1559	7	7	target: Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Genesis Fleetwood 30 Noren 40 Bradley 66 Saunders 125 Rory parlay flames out. Top 5s on the first 3. Top 20 on Saunders.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
5805	5805	26	26	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African also has posted consecutive top-five finishes at the U.S. Open, which leads me to believe he is ready to strike again. At $7,700, Grace is a great option for a mid-priced golfer when building your FanDuel lineups this week for the season's second major. -- Erik Dantoft
616	616	3	3	target: Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@gfienberg17 I have Peterson circled...haven't pulled the trigger yet
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
1066	1066	19	19	target: Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk 125/1 e/w. Dumped the PXG clubs and showed glimpses of form in the wrap around. Will back Every FRL just… https://t.co/nlXK2RBxtK
12707	12707	1	2	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely. I'm not sure how much credence we can give it but recent history suggests a late start on day one is beneficial as the last seven winners have all teed off late on day one.
8930	8930	3	4	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Knox  11. Anirban Lahiri  12. Peter Uihlein  13.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
1629	1629	6	6	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year. This is the highest of its kind since the Tour started collecting such records in 1983.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
4605	4605	31	32	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Eventually, he’s going to string it all together all four rounds, and this seems like the perfect place. If you can’t stomach those guys and still want a contrarian option, go Graham DeLaet. The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.
12886	12886	22	22	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a top 5 already, he made the cut last year shooting 2 under par rounds along the way without contending. Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance.
7023	7023	1	1	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events. There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event.
11596	11596	4	4	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Mayo welcomes Deshaun Watson, Joe Theismann, Jermichael Finley, Jamie Erdahl, Greg Jennings, Matt Mitrione, Kathryn Tappen, Jamey Eisenberg and many more into the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row. SHOW INDEX 1:29 Deshaun Watson 32 Free View in iTunes  106 Clean 2018 Fantasy Football - Tuesday on Radio Row Special with Stefon Diggs and many more! Pat Mayo welcomes Stefon Diggs, Chris Rose, Road Warrior Animal, Andy Benoit, Judy Battista, Caleb Truax, and Dave Hunt to the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row.
4461	4461	45	45	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also posted a 78 in 2016 and a 75 in 2015, and 2015 was the year he posted that career-best T42 around this track. Given the form he has been in since finishing T27 at Augusta, I think there is every reason to believe Grace is ready to finally put four rounds together around Sawgrass. After opening the Masters with a 76, Grace went 74, 71, 70 to climb the leaderboard and he has not looked back since.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
2603	2603	26	27	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
1484	1484	43	44	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A definite no for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jamie Lovemark ($9.6m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($8.9m); 3: Chez Reavie ($7.5m); 4: Brendan Steele ($9.3m); 5: Michael Thompson ($6.6m); 6: Charles Howell III ($9.9m); 7: Luke List ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($10.2m); 9: Henrik Norlander ($6.8m); =10: Kevin Na ($8.8m) & Sean O'Hair ($7.3m). Positives: The $7.5m for Chez Reavie looks a good investment to me.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
12047	12047	46	46	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the price I really like Molinari in cash game formats and think he is a great way to save some money while still getting a player who is very likely to make the cut while having the upside to be in contention come Sunday. Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut.
3098	3098	29	29	target: Garrigus. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one of the biggest hitters on the Web.com Tour last year. He checks the box in Birdie or Better % and SG: Off the Tee, much like Garrigus. The Mulli-man has missed the cut in his last two events, but he could bounce back in this weak field.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
11104	11104	75	76	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) David Lingmerth; 13) Blayne Barber / Sergio Garcia / Emiliano Grillo; 16) Chad Campbell; 17) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Billy Horschel; 19) Lucas Glover / Brian Harman / Chris Kirk / Brian Stuard. Greens in Regulation : 1) Russell Knox; 2) Tommy Fleetwood; 3) Tyrrell Hatton; 4) Billy Horschel / Alex Noren; 6) Keegan Bradley / Sergio Garcia / Martin Kaymer; 9) Dylan Frittelli / Scott Piercy; 11) Peter Uihlein; 12) John Peterson / Justin Thomas; 14) Gary Woodland; 15) Kevin Kisner / Adam Scott; 17) J.J.

5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.

6830	6830	11	13	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, let’s try and cultivate some John Deere Picks! Top Tier  Charles Howell III $9,000 – I like that we can roster him a little discount from last week. He hasn’t missed the cut here since 2012, which was his only one in 7 appearances.
4758	4758	11	11	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Brooks Koepka: Koepka lost in a playoff to Garcia at this event last year. Importantly, Brooks has found his form: His 67.1 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks second overall this week, and his 18.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg is third.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
5437	5437	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week. Daniel Summerhays – $7,800  We all got to see Daniel Summerhays battle it out last week, and because of that, I think there will be more people who jump on Summerhays than there should be.
285	285	20	21	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Texan finished fourth last year and is good value to have in your team this week. Another option is Brandt Snedeker, despite being disappointing last week we believe he has what it takes to bounce back so make sure he is in your team is your and looking to take good points this week. Five players to consider adding to your team...  1 Patrick Reed £14.5M  2 Ryan Moore £9.5M  3 Emiliano Grillo £12M  4 Johnson Wagner £5.5M  5 Brandt Snedeker £14M
2484	2484	31	31	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ could make mincemeat of this course, Spieth could putt the lights out and Rory will be fresh and raring to go again after his break. It's a simple truth that Garcia has never won a major or WGC event but he does have 22 top 10s in the former and 12 in the latter. Seven of his WGC top 10s have come in this event although it's obviously been played at different venues and all are, in fact, top sevens.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
6025	6025	85	86	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is not a lot of water at River Highlands, but there is on that hole, where almost 40 percent of the field notched birdies last year, but almost 15 percent left with bogey or worse.Weather-wise, typical Northeast conditions are expected for the first week of summer, though there is little chance of rain throughout the four days.Greens in regulation/strokes gained tee-to-greenProximity to the hole/ strokes gained approachScrambling/strokes gained around the greenDriving accuracy/strokes gained off the tee    Past Champions    2016 - Russell Knox  2015 - Bubba Watson  2014 - Kevin Streelman  2013 - Ken Duke  2012 - Marc Leishman  2011 - Freddie Jacobson  2010 - Bubba Watson  2009 - Kenny Perry  2008 - Stewart Cink  2007 - Hunter Mahan Greens tend to run a very slow sub-11 on the Stimpmeter, which enhances birdie opportunities but also neutralizes the best putters and brings a lot of other golfers into the Champion's Profile.The track features a drivable par-4 -- always fun for golf fans -- in the 296-yard 15th to add some drama late in the round. This week demands accuracy tee to green, and that will be focused on in the key stats below.
5272	5272	13	13	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – The Memorial Tournament  Lock of the week:  Jon Rahm $11,100 – Rahmthreat is clearly the “next big thing” on the PGA Tour right now without a missed cut this season. Rahm currently holds a 69.59 scoring average, seven T-10’s in 14 events, and a victory! We received a message from Jon’s caddie last week before Colonial that said, “hey, I know every course seems to fit my guy, but next week at Jack’s place is perfect!” Rahm, who stands at No.4 in FedEx Cup standings, has proved in many areas that he is a consistent scorer and is able to gain strokes everywhere.
4114	4114	37	38	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
11511	11511	23	23	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings scoring will also be extremely important to win cash this week as the WGC Mexico is a no-cut event. On that note, Casey ranks 6th in the field in DK scoring putting him just below favorites like DJ, Rahm, and JT but at a much cheaper value. Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field?
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
11651	11651	14	15	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four career starts, he has a win and no finish lower than T20. Sergio Garcia  Sergio needs to fix his short game. Since coming stateside for the Honda, the reigning Masters champ has been Top 5 in the field at PGA National and in Mexico in Strokes Gained: Approach.
2028	2028	10	11	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
3640	3640	58	59	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A bunch of international stars have stepped up to make up for Day’s loss: Tyrrell Hatton, Danny Willet, defending champ Branden Grace, Martin Kaymer, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Shane Lowry, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Yuta Ikea, and Hideto Tanihara have all decided to get in another event since they’re all over in the US already. Toss in some second-tier PGA regulars like Bill Haas, Kevin Kisner, Marc Leishman, Russell Knox, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Charley Hoffman, Charles Howell, Jason Dufner, Dirt McGirt, Russell Henley, and Webb Simpson, and 19 off the world’s Top 50 ranked players will be on the grounds. Team RBC has captured five of the past seven Heritage titles, while international players donned golf’s worst sartorial honor the other two years in that stretch.
481	481	14	15	target: Kelly Kraft, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
99	99	21	21	target: Hagy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
6252	6252	64	65	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m not prioritizing it when selecting golfers this week. Here’s how the top 20 percent of golfers in Rec metrics perform:  Adj Rd Score: -1.37  GIR: -2.39  DD: -2.09  DA: -2.82  SC: -2.60  Adj Bird Avg: -6.45  A Few Names to Remember (From Comparable Courses)  Among golfers with at least five starts in our database at these two comparable courses, both Chad Campbell and Scott Stallings have been consistent, exceeding salary-based expectations in five of their six outings (83.3 percent). Campbell is not in the field this week, but Stallings is, priced at $6,900 on DraftKings and $5,300 on FanDuel.
12708	12708	64	65	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having won the USPGA Championship in August, Justin Thomas has now won four of his last 14 starts and if he claims his second major in-a-row on Sunday he'll move to the top of the Official World Rankings. He would have done so if he'd have reached the final of the WGC-Match Play final two weeks ago but he admitted after his loss to Bubba Watson in the semi-final that moving to the top of the rankings was constantly on his mind. That's one concern, and so is his poor Augusta record.
5994	5994	14	15	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Jason Day  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, Paul Casey, Kyle Stanley, Anirban Lahiri, Bud Cauley, Graham DeLaet, Byeong Hun-An  – Chez Reavie, David Lingmerth, Harris English, Derek Fathauer, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Tony Finau  Bets  Kyle Stanley 50-1  Harris English 100-1 EW  Anirban Lahiri 150-1 EW  Derek Fathauer 300-1 EW If the trend continues he’s a good enough putter to really take advantage on a course like this. Fathauer is a player capable of putting together some big rounds, and his approach game showed big improvement his last time out.
9218	9218	11	12	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's going to be chalky at this price. -- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor.
8143	8143	11	12	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Enough with the BS let’s get to some picks. Winner Section  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – Disclaimer: I have the ultimate love/hate relationship with Jordan Spieth. Well mostly just hate.
1761	1761	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surely the tare has to end somewhere, soon?!? $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Ryan Moore ($8.6m) and Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); Brendan Steele is unlikely to disappoint at $8.2 million. 5th (2012), 5th (2013) and 6th (2014) tell you all you need to know about his liking for this test, but his recalcitrant putter is likely to keep him away from the ultimate victory.
607	607	6	6	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
6610	6610	9	10	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bryson DeChambeau  Top Strokes Gained: Putting (last week)  1. Robert Garrigus  2. Andrew Loupe  3.
5436	5436	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week.
7839	7839	18	19	target: Brooks Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: JB Holmes  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler, Jon Rahm, Daniel Berger, Brooks Koepka, Russell Henley  – Branden Grace, Gary Woodland, Thomas Pieters, Bill Haas, Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel, JB Holmes  Bets:  Gary Woodland 70-1 He’ll be looking to make his mark in a big event soon and this could easily be the place. He finished T17 here in 2015 and was near his second win of the season the last time he played in the USA.
9947	9947	35	35	target: Stuard. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That ranking of 38th in Greens in Regulation is better than it looks as well. Of the players that have played 24 rounds (how many he’s played) or more, only three players rank higher than Stuard. He is currently hitting over 74% of greens which is more than acceptable and will aid him this week.
12563	12563	6	7	target: Grayson Murray– 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DRIVER-OFF-THE-DECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK    Grayson Murray– Yep, a little extra dash of bold this week. Whether you’ve been noticing or not, the wacky, formerly toothless Murray has been having a solid season thus far, making 9 of 11 cuts, with 4 of those going for top 15 finishes (including a t-14th finish at Bay Hill a couple weeks ago). Only one appearance here in Houston (t-55th last year), but don’t let that stop you.
438	438	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also a former champion here, so I certainly won't talk you off of him in tournaments. Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format.
1032	1032	3	3	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
4718	4718	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option  Anirban Lahiri $6,400 – We wanted to go super basement option here and give you a guy you can pair with DJ comfortably. There’s a lot of good value in the upper $6K range this week, but Lahiri is our guy in the bottom of this range. Now, if you were paying attention on Friday at TPC, Lahiri was -6 on his round approaching the 18th tee, where he then proceeded to hit 3 tee shots in the water left to miss the cut by 4 shots.
2002	2002	21	22	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vaughn Taylor has made nine consecutive cuts and is looking to channel his good vibes from last year’s victory. DraftKings bargain: Ryan Brehm at $6,700. Has made seven of eight cuts in his first season on the PGA Tour, hits it a mile and seems poised to finish top 5 at some point sooner rather than later.
851	851	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has a power game that travels well. Brooks Koepka. Has a power game that travels well.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
708	708	13	13	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			100 to 1 bets that should peak your interest Danny Lee Cam Smith JT Poston Scott Piercy
6588	6588	24	24	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
12892	12892	65	65	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar has finished inside the top 10 in 4 of the last 6 Masters and he really does come alive on hard and fast courses where his combination of approach accuracy and touch on and around the greens will always give him a chance. But away from the place part of the bet giving us value I also think we might see a more assured Kuchar this year after his Royal Birkdale exploits last summer. I think he will have learned a lot from that battle with Spieth and this is obviously his first appearance back at Augusta since.
514	514	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I will be spending 55 minutes of our 1 hr podcast telling @KendoVT how much I love Finau this week https://t.co/726ehHw8QO
7369	7369	5	6	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ will be just fine. Rory McIlroy – $11,000  What to do with Rory this week could actually be the million dollar question. He has been very bad lately, missing three of his last four cuts.

310	310	1	1	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, McIlroy value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP… https://t.co/9OP07g5IZt
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
8163	8163	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler has been on the precipice all season long, and he'll be licking his chops at having his final chance for a major this season at a course he plays so well. Brooks Koepka (DK: $9,200, FD: $8,600)    When we talk about guys who are long off the tee, we have to include Koepka. He's a type of player that I always target in majors and has gained the most strokes against the field in majors over the past two years.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
2518	2518	47	48	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: David Lipsky (coming off 2nd place finish, has won at altitude before)  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Gary Woodland, Paul Casey, Martin Kaymer, Louis Oosthuizen  – Thomas Pieters, Pablo Larrazabal, Alex Noren, Danny Willett, David Lipsky, Ben An, Jason Dufner  Good luck with your DraftKings WGC Mexico Championship lineups and picks, and make sure you’re checking back on our Golf Picks section to get Keagan and Alex’s picks that will be posted by Tuesday evening. He’s played great at the Omega Masters over the years (won there in 2015 and runner-up in 2012) so can definitely handle the altitude shift. Don’t forget that he finished T5 in his second last start and won’t have to deal with questions about fan behavior here; and that should help him get out of his own head this week.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
13519	13519	4	5	target: Grayson Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Avoid him in cash. Grayson Murray $7,300 – If you’re looking for a bomber who can score and look like an idiot on social media, Grayson is your guy! The form is ok, but the scoring potential and length will be an asset at TPC San Antonio.
11206	11206	42	43	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also one of the best at keeping his ball low and out of the wind, which obviously will help him around this track. Others to Consider: Daniel Berger, Ollie Schniederjans, Billy Horschel  MORE DFS: Lineup Builder | Strategy  Value Targets  Anirban Lahiri - $7,000  Anirban is a mainstay in these articles whenever we get to a tight track that forces players to go less-than-driver off the tee. A local resident, Anirban is familiar with PGA National’s layout and the wind conditions that players will face here.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.

1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome.

10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
3987	3987	22	22	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship

10954	10954	39	40	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Targeting a multitude of mid-tier golfers might be a better choice, as strong plays like Branden Grace, Tommy Fleetwood, Alex Noren and Marc Leishman can all be had for less than $10,000. Other strong targets for this format include Paul Casey, Branden Steele, Ollie Schniederjans, Martin Kaymer, Charles Howell III, Martin Laird and Brandon Harkins. Tournaments – It feels like a week where Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could easily go under-owned due to poor recent form or poor course history.
8680	8680	30	43	target: Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Stewart Cink, Jason Dufner, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Lucas Glover, Brian Harman, Hideki Matsuyama, Jhonattan Vegas. 1 - Keegan Bradley, Bryson DeChambeau, Bill Haas, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Kevin Kisner, Brooks Koepka, Martin Laird, Danny Lee, Marc Leishman, Francesco Molinari, Kevin Na, Sean O'Hair, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter, Chez Reavie, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, Kyle Stanley, Henrik Stenson, Justin Thomas. The BMW Championship, the third leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, has a number of trends that are intriguing.
1914	1914	40	41	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
10289	10289	28	29	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Both Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson are skipping this event, but there are a lot of elite players in attendance. Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler and last year’s champ Jon Rahm will all be in attendance, as will foreign stars like Justin Rose and Alex Noren. There is also a guy named Tiger Woods who will be in attendance, and you can check in on my thoughts on what to expect from Tiger here.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
2571	2571	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide. He had back-to-back T3 finishes at Crans-sur Sierre in 2014 and 2015.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
10544	10544	25	25	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident. As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh.
2459	2459	34	34	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two. Click To Enlarge!
6148	6148	38	39	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall though, scoring conditions will likely be ideal throughout, so expect regular low scores here and possibly something in the high teens to win. Last six winners  2016 –- Russell Knox -14 (over Jerry Kelly -13)  2015 — Bubba Watson -16 (over Paul Casey in playoff)  2014 — Kevin Streelman -15 (over Sergio Garcia and KJ Choi -14)  2013 — Ken Duke -12 (over Chris Stroud in playoff)  2012 — Marc Leishman -14 (over Charley Hoffman and Bubba Watson -13)  2011 — Fredrik Jacobson -20 (over Ryan Moore and John Rollins -19)  Winning Trends  Four of the last seven winners of the Travelers have been first-time winners on the PGA Tour. Three of the last four winners of this event were coming into the week off of missed cuts in their previous start.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
10976	10976	23	23	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
765	765	12	12	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can't wait for Webb Simpson Chalk mania this week.. On another note, Molinari is a guy I like heading into this complete unknown course
541	541	6	6	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
8370	8370	34	35	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Weekly Finalists:  My Favorites: You can see the entire list at mikeglasscott.com  Since none of the above are playing this week, time to get creative. My Choice: Webb Simpson  Close Second: Ryan Moore, Bill Haas  Outliers: Lucas Glover, Kyle Stanley, Haotong Li  Gut Shot(s): Kevin Na, Brandon Hagy  Rank Outsiders: Peter Malnati, William McGirt  QUESTION(S) OF THE WEEK:  Remember, if you don’t see a guy in my choices, it’s more than likely that I have already selected them. Who do I save???
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
12048	12048	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut. The following week Hatton’s ownership was much lower and we saw him finish T3 against a loaded field.
6873	6873	39	40	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In-Play Tactics    Moore sat third after round one and he was never headed form halfway but don't worry if your fancy has a poor first round as a slow start can be overcome at Deere Run. Steve Stricker and Zach Johnson have both won recently having trailed by seven strokes after round one and Spieth trailed by six after the opening day in 2013 and by eight two years later! Spieth was still five back at halfway in 2015 and he trailed by six shots after round three in 2013.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
1169	1169	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s supposed to be taking some time off for back issues — but he couldn’t resist the guaranteed large paycheck by playing in his own backyard — so approach with caution. Bubba Watson ($7,600): The defending champion is third in the field with a 312.8-yard LT DD, and he ranks seventh with a 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. His 6.7 percent Odds to Win are the best among this middle third of golfers.
1692	1692	3	3	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
6583	6583	10	10	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it. James Hahn – $8,800  In a week where Tony Finau looks to be the chalk, James Hahn will garner next to no ownership in a spot he could easily go off in.
5637	5637	14	15	target: Brooks Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Wood, Bernd Wiesberger  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jason Day, Brooks Koepka, Alex Noren, Marc Leishman, Branden Grace, Adam Scott, Branden Steele, Jordan Spieth  – Thomas Pieters, Louis Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Sean O’Hair, Chris Wood, Patrick Reed, George Coetzee, Bernd Wiesberger  Bets:  Jason Day 12-1  Alex Noren 55-1 ew  Louis Oosthuizen 67-1  Marc Leishman 125-1/100-1 ew  George Coetzee 250-1 ew Two top fives in his last three starts means O’Hair shouldn’t be forgotten about this week. His best finish last season was also on a US Open venue at Beth Page Black when he finished T2 at the Barclays.
3310	3310	28	29	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has top 20 upside this here this week and is a really nice value at only $7,300, that can be used in both cash games and GPPs. Jason Dufner: (7,100) Dufner is another player who is just way too cheap for how consistent he has been this season. The 70th ranked player in the world has been great, only missing one cut this season, and finishing no worse than T25 in all of the events he has made the cut.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
780	780	17	17	target: Johnston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
3124	3124	36	36	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And outsiders have fared well here of late too...  Last year's winner, Herman, was matched at [1000.0] before the off and so too was the 2013 winner, D.A points. I have fond memories of collecting on Holmes at [38.0] in 2015 so he wasn't a huge price but Matt Jones was matched at [200.0] 12 months earlier. There are some high class players in the line-up this week but it might be worth swerving them all if recent evidence is anything to go by.
7837	7837	28	28	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS. Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign.
1409	1409	6	6	target: Cabrera-Bello. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I see @DraftKings brought back Chalka Cabrera-Bello.
947	947	15	15	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First look at the #RSMClassic board, few long shots sticking out. Cook 80-1 Tway 100-1 Power 125-1 Wise 125-1 Ha… https://t.co/9aSkYXRGx2
712	712	163	164	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour / Ted Potter Jnr; 3) Tyler Duncan; 4) Ben Crane; 5) Webb Simpson; 6) Ryan Moore; 7) Ken Duke; 8) Zach Johnson; 9) Corey Conners; 10) Emiliano Grillo / David Hearn; 12) Rob Oppenheim; 13) Chez Reavie; 14) Vaughn Taylor; 15) Kevin Na / Conrad Shindler; 17) Jon Curran; 18) Keegan Bradley / Martin Laird; 20) Lucas Glover / Richy Werenski. Greens in Regulation : 1) Martin Flores; 2) Brendan Steele; 3) Brice Garnett; 4) Harold Varner III; 5) Corey Conners; 6) Luke List; 7) Keith Mitchell; 8) Graham DeLaet / Sam Saunders; 10) Zach Johnson; 11) Lucas Glover; 12) Tyler Duncan; 13) Bud Cauley; 14) Emiliano Grillo / Rory Sabbatini; 16) Ryan Armour / Keegan Bradley / Matt Every / J.J. Spaun; 20) Zac Blair / Stephan Jaeger / Jason Kokrak / Ryan Moore / Rob Oppenheim. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Robert Garrigus; 2) Kevin Na; 3) Jason Gore / Andrew Landry; 5) Webb Simpson; 6) John Daly; 7) Brice Garnett; 8) Danny McCarthy / Peter Uihlein; 10) Roberto Diaz / Rory Sabbatini / Ricky Werenski; 13) Matt Every / Peter Malnati / Grayson Murray; 16) Rob Oppenheim; 17) Bronson Burgoon / Martin Laird / Martin Piller; 20) Nate Lashley.
814	814	4	4	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Par 4 Scoring – Koepka, Castro, Cauley, McGirt, Simpson  3. Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5.
229	229	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes 40-1... has smoked Pebble a couple times, good on poa, always seems to take a few starts to round into best form
1815	1815	5	5	target: Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
4460	4460	11	11	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form here makes pretty grim reading, despite making 3/3 cuts. Grace has not managed to finish better than T42, as he seemingly struggles to put four rounds together here. In 2013 he posted a final round 77, to fall 30 places, after getting inside the top-10 earlier in the round.
12785	12785	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet.
11530	11530	79	80	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”  Last Week Rank: 16,851  Season Rank: 4872 *Did not play most of Segment 1*  Starters:  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Branden Grace  Marc Leishman  Bench:  Justin Thomas  Paul Casey        Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Mo Yoshimoto    “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Rank: 2063  Season Rank: 384  Starters:  Jordan Spieth  Tony Finau  Phil Mickelson  Bubba Watson  Bench:  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay    ~    One-and-Done      Each week I will think out loud about my process in determining my One-and-Done selection. If you are new to the One-and-Done format, it is like an NFL survivor league.
3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
2645	2645	24	24	target: Haas: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be able to handle the altitude at Chapultepec and I am expecting a top 30 finish out of him this week. Bill Haas: (7,000) If you want to take the course manager approach this week with this being a course we are very unfamiliar with, Haas makes a lot of sense at his cheap price. He has yet to miss a cut this season and has finished no worse than 20th place with a T4 at the other WGC event this year, The HSBC Champions.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
4117	4117	43	44	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2032	2032	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
3843	3843	2	2	target: Kaymer: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Martin Kaymer: Kaymer has not missed a cut in his last 28 starts worldwide. He’s coming off his best Masters finish (by far) as he finished T16 last week on the back of a final round 68.
11012	11012	12	12	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – Genesis Open  Lock of the week:  Paul Casey – $10,200 – The upper range on DraftKings presents some great options in this stellar field for the Genesis Open. We love the way Casey fits into GPP and cash lineups allowing you to avoid the fairly weak $6K range. He finished T8 last week at Pebble while leading the field in SG:T2G.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
6400	6400	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully the easy-to-hit fairways afford him the ability to put the remainder of his game to good use. Tony Finau & Sean O’Hair – Finau’s made nine of ten cuts, crushes Par 4s, and now gets to deal with fairways you can land an aircraft carrier on. After missing out on my boy Stanley last week, I refuse to the let same happen with Finau… O’Hair does everything pretty well across the board, then laps everyone on the Par 4s.
5435	5435	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is too much risk and barely any upside with Gay this week. Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt.
7174	7174	23	23	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Sergio sees a lot of ownership because of this but I will still be overweight on him for the week. Henrik Stenson – GPP – DK: $9600 FD: $8700  Stenson is quietly showing good form just in time to defend his Open Championship title. With a T10 and a T26 in his last two events, I am not worried about his earlier season struggles.
2881	2881	4	4	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A no brainer. Tyrrell Hatton ($9,100) – “Impressive” would be putting it lightly for Tyrrell Hatton this year in his transition to being a part-time PGA player. Hatton contended for the win at the very tough PGA National and made a nice run in Mexico two weeks ago – he has not finished worse than T13 worldwide in his last four starts.
11233	11233	20	20	target: Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last four appearances this season he has made every cut and even posted a T5 at Waste Management. Hadley ranks highly in our FGI Model when you sort by statistics as he has been extremely good tee-to-green this season. At only $7,700 this week, I like his value for cash games, but also like his upside for GPPs.
107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
261	261	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is definitely hard enough to punish even some of the very best, so I would still consider it to be a potentially palatable investment opportunity. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Jason Day ($12,500) and Dustin Johnson ($12,100) – I hate to sound like a broken record here, but these two simply cannot be bested in terms of their sheer combination of power, accuracy, and precision. While they both bear some risk at their salary levels, I think it would be outrageous to fade them with their current form and proven ability to take this course apart.
7732	7732	16	17	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Market Leaders  Matt Kuchar was absolutely exhausted in Canada last week and there's a possibility that Jordan Spieth is still fatigued after the pair's epic duel at Royal Birkdale a fortnight ago but that a big if. The world no.2 took last week off and a well-rested and refreshed Jordan Spieth is most definitely the man to beat and I'm a little surprised he's not a shade shorter than he is. As already highlighted, this is a tournament that favours the very best and two of the last three winners have won here after having a week's rest following a major victory.
6534	6534	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sky Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31. -- Michael Collins  DraftKings value picks  Nick Taylor  Taylor has been on a pretty hot run the past month or so, and we're going back to the well at this price.
2693	2693	9	9	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Among the many small reasons for expecting improvement from DeChambeau is his form here as an amateur, which includes guiding SMU to victory when he was the only player in a good field to break 70 in both rounds at the course. Isolated, that’s nowhere near enough to make a case but DeChambeau caught the eye last time, striking the ball exceptionally well at the extremely difficult PGA National only to find all his work undone by one of the worst putting displays you’ll see. What particularly impressed about his tee-to-green play was the fact that DeChambeau was nursing a nasty cut to his hand in practice, and on the assumption that he’s both recovered and able to bring that ball-striking to Copperhead, he might just have a chance.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
9007	9007	6	7	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fact and figures  Course record: 61, Justin Thomas, round two in 2015-16 season. Most Birdies: 30, Justin Thomas, 2015-16. He made 29 last year.
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship

12008	12008	3	3	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
7989	7989	77	78	target: Brooks Koepka; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Tommy Fleetwood; 2) Ross Fisher; 3) Henrik Stenson; 4) Xander Schauffele; 5) Paul Casey; 6) Gary Woodland; 7) Sergio Garcia / Jordan Spieth; 9) Hideki Matsuyama; 10) Steve Stricker / Bernd Wiesberger; 12) Adam Scott; 13) Jason Dufner; 14) Graham DeLaet / Lee Westwood; 16) Hudson Swafford; 17) Luke List; 18) Tony Finau / Rickie Fowler / Branden Grace.

10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
7398	7398	1	2	target: Kevin Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
12778	12778	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			283 yards (40th), 66.1% fairways (31st), 68.1% greens in regulation (19th), 69.6% scrambling (1st), 1.61 putts per GIR (8th). 2010, Phil Mickelson (-16). 297 yards (2nd), 60.7% fairways (45th), 75.0% greens in regulation (3rd), 77.8% scrambling (3rd), 1.76 putts per GIR (10th).
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
11466	11466	28	28	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So did Justin Thomas, who tied for fifth with Thomas Pieters, who was the runner-up at Riviera two weeks prior. Only Ross Fisher, who tied for third with Rahm, entered in so-so form. To refresh: Mexico City is more than 7,500 feet above sea level, meaning the 7,300-yard track will play more like 6,500.
12577	12577	16	17	target: Cabrera Bello 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After being knocked out of the Matchplay early, that could work to his advantage here. Rafa Cabrera Bello 33/1  RCB has been steady as they come recently and arrives to Houston in good form. He was knocked out of the matchplay early last week so he has had plenty of time to get his game right here.
1010	1010	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk - $11,300  2. Charles Howell III - $9,200  3. Cody Gribble - $8,400  4.
12575	12575	35	35	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will always be a popular player in terms of ownership, and generally the highest priced golfer gets a little bump just because. I will much rather spend the $100 less for the lower owned Rose who likely has a greater win probability. Luke List – $9,600  Welcome to Luke List chalk week.
7124	7124	26	27	target: Francesco Molinari, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
7706	7706	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His play has been strong all year, and as his record proves, Firestone is a good track for him. Also like: Adam Scott, Branden Grace and Alex Noren. The Aussie is a past champ and has mostly been in good form this year.
11769	11769	18	19	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since 2009, Kuchar has made seven appearances at this venue and never finished outside of the top 40. Jason Dufner – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10100  Dating back to 2009 Jason Dufner has never finished outside of the top thirty at this event. Add in the fact that Dufner has made 12 straight cuts at events with a cut and Dufner is a cash lock for me this week.
8326	8326	543	544	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The MDF rule is in effect if more than 78 golfers make the original cut.

7837	7837	28	29	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good target on a week where placing points may be more vital than overall birdie bonuses in DFS. Others: Kyle Stanley, Charl Schwartzel  High-Upside GPP Picks  Brooks Koepka ($11,100): Many people may scoff at paying up $11,100 for Brooks, especially when Rory McIlroy is just $300 more, but the fact is Brooks has outplayed everyone in the world not named Jordan Spieth since mid-June. Koepka certainly has the length to take on Firestone and the fact he placed T6 here two years ago, when he was still finding his way on tour, is a great sign.
330	330	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed — It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it’s hard to see why he doesn’t deserve a look again this week. He’s in America Mode.
5227	5227	29	29	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His missed cut will still be hurting those he burned, and his price tag this week won’t be drawing them back in. $8,700 is a lot to pay for Dufner at this event, but he will not have any ownership on him this week so rostering 5% of him will likely put you overweight on him. He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
4556	4556	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better time than the PLAYERS. Rickie Fowler – $9,300  It is all or nothing for Rickie Fowler at TPC Sawgrass. Literally.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
198	198	9	9	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #careerbuilderchallenge Picks Reed 16-1 Casey 25-1 Rahm 28-1 Grillo 28-1 Lovemark 35-1 Piercy 50-1
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
7902	7902	14	14	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They just don’t need further explanation this week, and instead will be listed below. Rahm comes in at second in our Cheat Sheet, and while this will be his first trip to Firestone CC, the course design fits his gameplay extremely well, hence his #2 rank in the Cheat Sheet. As the #4 Par 4 Scorer on Tour, Rahm should be able to use his abilities to go low on this long Par 70 course.
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
1733	1733	110	111	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Kyle Stanley; 3) Russell Henley; 4) Brian Stuard; 5) Austin Cook / Billy Horschel; 7) Chez Reavie; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Colt Knost / Kevin Streelman; 11) Brian Gay; 12) John Huh; 13) Rickie Fowler / Brice Garnett; 15) David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Justin Thomas; 18) Francesco Molinari / Jordan Spieth; 20) Daniel Berger / Vaughn Taylor. Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Billy Horschel; 3) Kevin Streelman; 4) Chez Reavie; 5) Keegan Bradley / Shane Lowry; 7) Francesco Molinari; 8) Matt Kuchar; 9) Tony Finau; 10) Daniel Berger / William McGirt; 12) Kevin Chappell / Russell Henley / Hudson Swafford / Justin Thomas / Peter Uihlein; 17) Bryson DeChambeau / Chesson Hadley / Russell Knox / John Peterson / Brendan Steele. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Phil Mickelson; 2) Daniel Berger; 3) Justin Thomas; 4) Cameron Smith; 5) Hideki Matsuyama; 6) Jon Rahm / Chris Stroud; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Wesley Bryan; 10) Rickie Fowler; 11) Zach Johnson; 12) Alex Noren; 13) Patton Kizzire / Jordan Spieth / Kyle Stanley; 16) Matt Kuchar / John Peterson; 18) Dominic Bozzelli / Ian Poulter.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
3543	3543	21	21	target: Hadwin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@Hunta512. If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,900) Hadwin has been one of my go to guys all season and I am not going to let his lack of course history pull me off him now. It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field.
13524	13524	40	40	target: Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a boom or bust play as demonstrated by three top 15’s and three missed cuts in his last six events, but that’s what you’re looking for in this price range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List).
10865	10865	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Martin Kaymer has been hitting the ball well for a while now It's possible that we don't see the best of him until he returns to the east coast, but Kaymer's record in California is very solid with just three stroke play starts, all in the US Open, all cuts made and two top-15 finishes. Kaymer has a phenomenally good record in the United States, winning two majors and a PLAYERS while also reaching the Match Play final in nearby Arizona, which used to be his winter base before he relocated to Florida.
3632	3632	23	23	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bernd Wiesberger 20% – Plays consistent tee to green golf and he’s made both of his cuts at Augusta because of it. Like Haas, one year his putter will catch fire and he’ll spike. THE SINGLES  Emiliano Grillo
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
9378	9378	27	27	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having the winner in your lineups will be a must to win big on DraftKings. A low owned winner would be even better…  Best bargain basement option:  Grayson Murray $6,400 – If we stack ranked based on the fictional stat of “Strokes Gained: Aggression”, Grayson would be on top of the ranking in more facets than golf. Being aggressive is critical to playing well at Kapalua.
7573	7573	19	19	target: Seamus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be one of our highest owned guys this week across all DraftKings contests. Best bargain basement option:  Seamus Power $6,800 – Seamus is a Web.com Tour grad from last season that is quietly having quite the first year on the PGA Tour with 12/16 cuts made. He’s yet to find a T10, but is trending in the right direction with a T25 at the John Deere Classic and a T18 at The Barbasol Championship.
4704	4704	46	47	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In order to make birdies on the par-fours, one-putt percentage and SG: putting will ultimately separate the contenders from the coasters. FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Dustin Johnson - $20,700  Jordan Spieth - $18,400  Sergio Garcia - $18,100  Brooks Koepka - $17,400    Cash-game Target (50/50s, Double-Ups): With Johnson and Spieth outside of the ultimate comfort zone in terms of affordability when building a cash-game squad, Koepka will be a popular candidate as the highest-priced player in many lineups. He held the lead after three rounds during the 2016 Byron Nelson, but eventually fell to Garcia in a Sunday playoff.
12892	12892	65	65	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar has finished inside the top 10 in 4 of the last 6 Masters and he really does come alive on hard and fast courses where his combination of approach accuracy and touch on and around the greens will always give him a chance. But away from the place part of the bet giving us value I also think we might see a more assured Kuchar this year after his Royal Birkdale exploits last summer. I think he will have learned a lot from that battle with Spieth and this is obviously his first appearance back at Augusta since.
5271	5271	9	10	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be high owned, so go big! Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,600 – It’s no secret Kiz is in great form after winning the Dean & Deluca last week. He’s an excellent putter on bentgrass greens, which we will see again this week at Memorial.
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
10076	10076	16	17	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year’s winner, Hudson Swafford, will be there to defend his title. Upper echelon Tour players Brandt Snedeker, Kevin Kisner, Patrick Reed, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Brian Harman, and Kevin Chappell will all tee it up alongside the rest of the Tour regulars. As long as the Tour keeps making stops at courses where the winning score is routinely 24 under par, birdie or better % will continue to be the most important key stat.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
4729	4729	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I cannot remember the last time I saw his price this low, along with his betting odds at 16/1, which seem long for a field of this strength. Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament.
9218	9218	12	12	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's going to be chalky at this price. -- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor.
8089	8089	20	20	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, the only thing that might cause him any confusion next Sunday is if Paul McCartney presents the trophy. Matsuyama may not know The Beatles very well – but how well do you know his career? Try our quiz to find out.
1613	1613	12	12	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda update Knox 45 Berger 50 Ollie 55 Grillo 80 Wiesberger 80 Horschel 100
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
13317	13317	67	68	target: Si Woo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly as I mentioned earlier in the piece it may pay to look at a players past performance at the OHL Mayakoba as this is the other Greg Norman designed course played on the PGA Tour. Finally similarities have been drawn between the Oaks Course and Pete Dye design courses due to the run off areas around the greens and one thing we can’t do is doubt Si Woo’s liking for a Pete Dye design! It is these last three pointers that clinched it for me to roll the dice with Si Woo again this week and I am hoping he can add his name to the list of players who have memorably bounced back from heartbreak one week to win the next.
3472	3472	18	19	target: Angel Cabrera 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has the game to land you a few eagle/birdie streak bonuses if things go well, too. Angel Cabrera ($6,700) – Angel Cabrera’s recent form isn’t something to be admired, as he’s only played twice this season and missed the cut on both occasions. Still, history tells us that when considering whether or not to roster Cabrera at Augusta, his recent form shouldn’t really be weighed very heavily.
1427	1427	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@JazzrazDFS U forgot Paul Casey too
