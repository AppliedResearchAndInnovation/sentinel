3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
122	122	12	12	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson, Spieth, Mickelson, Walker and Koepka have all safely qualified. Holmes, Watson, Kuchar, Fowler and Furyk amongst those down to 22nd in the current standings (see above) still have a shot at qualifying automatically this week. From there Davis Love III announces 3 of his 4 Captain's Picks after the BMW Championship (3rd of 4 events), with his final selection being announced after the Tour Championship.
10406	10406	12	13	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus. Nine Bridges: Justin Thomas; EW Places: Leishman, Cam Smith, Whee Kim, Brown, Lahiri, List, Lovemark. TPC Summerlin: Patrick Cantlay; EW Places: Whee Kim, Cejka, Hadley, Kizzire, Hossler, Hoge Bradley, DeChambeau.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
5084	5084	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose , Kevin Chappell & Ryan Moore – Keeping things pretty chalky in the B-List, with a troika of former champs and a player on the ascent. Kuch has made nine cuts in a row at The Memorial, highlighted by a win in 2013, six Top 10s, and no finish worse than T26. If the course was designed by Pete Dye or Jack Nicklaus, you always play Kuchar… Hideki missed the cut last season following a win and a T5 in his first two appearances.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
5464	5464	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  See above. You have to drop down to Kevin Chappell at $8,800 for a player approaching what Mickelson brings to the table. He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints.
10205	10205	13	14	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, it may be enough to keep other owners away. -- Zach Turcotte  Tiger Woods  It is difficult to target a golfer making his first competitive start with FedEx Cup points on the line since this event last year, but in this case, the golfer is Tiger Woods. There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event.
7173	7173	30	31	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course was last played in 2008 when Padraig Harrington took home the Claret Jug. In that year a few current players finished high up on the leaderboard; Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey all finished within the top 10. All three of these players share a few traits within their games; they are all accurate off of the tee and great tee-to-green.
9279	9279	26	26	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
4057	4057	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
9855	9855	30	31	target: J.J. Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plenty of people have pegged Finau as a big time break out player this year, and a win this week would be a huge start to the season for Tony. J.J. Spaun – $7,600  J.J. Spaun comes in ranked first in my weighted stat model this week because he finished the 2017 season hot as hell. Perhaps it is lucky for us that he didn’t pick up his first career title in the fall swing season and was saving it for the 2018 Sony Open.
7360	7360	12	12	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's the same game plan I had last time we were here." Stenson didn't have his best stuff at the Scottish Open last week but he closed with a 68 for T26 and his best Open results have come when he's warmed up on the links in Scotland. He may also have noted that Padraig Harrington came to Royal Birkdale as the defending champion in 2008 and retained the Claret Jug.
9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
12386	12386	35	35	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's the ultimate wild card because you're likely going to burn him at some point, but you still wouldn't miss him if you didn't. Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format.
335	335	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very minimal research but on top of DJ and Spieth I really like JT this week. Vegas And Haas for cheap. Woody Phil and Reed too.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
8878	8878	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically, Finau is dominating off of the tee recently, a quick glance at our VIP Research Station shows he is right at the top of the field in this regard. On a course with plenty of scoring opportunities, I like Finau’s chances this week. Keegan Bradley – Cash – DK: $9300  Bradley made ten straight cuts to finish the season.
2178	2178	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world. Day doesn’t have the strongest history here (two MCs and a 64th), but the last time he played this event was way back in 2012 and given the layoff I wouldn’t put too much stock in his shaky course history. While he hasn’t shown dominant form yet in 2017, Day put in three great rounds at Pebble and this could easily be the week he puts the hammer down and distances himself from the field.
10594	10594	80	81	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley. Plus, Ian Poulter, Steve Stricker, and Ryan Moore will be making their 2018 PGA debuts.
4634	4634	178	178	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
3028	3028	24	25	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.

204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
12032	12032	41	42	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Though Arnold isn’t physically present, his legend lives on in what should be another fantastic close to the Florida Swing.

The length becomes a nice advantage on the reachable par-5 holes and longer par-4s that prove demanding over four rounds.
93	93	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sleeper of the Week  Our weekly pick for you is one that you may not expect. Graham DeLaet: He scored a top 5 here in 2012 and was 20th in the Olympics a few weeks ago. He also posted a top 10 in July, so he is close.
7240	7240	10	11	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance. Even if you doubt his ability to win, there's an awful lot of each-way juice in that price with eight each-way places.

Of those that did, Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel were the most notable within our price range. Both have majors pedigree, excellent Florida records and are long off the tee.
2192	2192	33	34	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
1209	1209	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he'll have hit the reset button since placing 10th in Tiger's tournament and he's definitely worth following in this event. Hopefully, this is the best market for us to fully cash in and it's worth pointing out that with four payout places, Reed could finish eighth in the tournament and we'd still edge a profit on him. With the front of the betting so strong, it's hard to find much space for any bigger-priced players.
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
12810	12810	14	15	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			AUGUSTA, Georgia — Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo is buying into the hype, saying Tiger Woods will “threaten” in his quest for a 15th major championship this week. Woods is on a mission to add to his 79 PGA TOUR victories and 14 majors, returning to Augusta National for the first time in a playing capacity since a T17 finish in 2015. Woods has already collected the green jacket four times, but not since 2005.
578	578	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will. He’s long enough to suit this course and with 9 consecutive tournaments of being under par, Reed has the scoring ability to win everything come Sunday.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.

The South Carolina native is a Bermuda-grass stud with excellent course history here, making the cut all four times he’s played the event while picking up two top-10s his last two attempts.

He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.

Tyrone Van Aswegen … No golfer puts four rounds together regularly, but the absence of it entirely is the ironic constant among rank-and-filers. When expectations need to remain high to sustain a livelihood at this level, any spark can be monumental, not to mention lucrative.

Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
6579	6579	30	30	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The scrubs in these tournaments are trash, and the upside a top tiered golfer offers isn’t much higher than someone in the $9K range. That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls.
12168	12168	3	4	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fervor that Tiger Woods manufactured at last week's Valspar Championship was all the most skeptical needed to close the chapter on any residual doubt in his latest return to competition. His performance aligned with candor, honesty, adjusted expectations and the glint of his old and still familiar fire. It reminded us of all that once was good and that he could be again.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
186	186	3	3	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SonyOpen Picks Luau Jimmy 22-1 Paul Casey 28-1 Russell Knox 40-1 Daniel 🍔 40-1 Scott Piercy 40-1 Chris Kirk 50-1 Harris English 60-1
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
5340	5340	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On to the Picks! Next Day Air  Brooks Koepka $11,500 – He finished second here last year, 3rd the year before and 19th in 2014. I watched him all last week on Shot Tracker and his biggest issue seemed to be making putts.
2472	2472	18	18	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be in for some positive regression this week. When looking at our European Tour comp courses, Garcia fits. He’s especially fond of Crans Sur Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters.
9381	9381	4	5	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Embed from Getty Images  Kevin Kisner $8,400 – We’ve spoken to a couple of caddies on the PGA Tour that say the most important factors at Kapalua are putting, wedge play, and staying aggressive. Enter Kevin Kisner. He’s only outranked by two other players in the field over the last five years in SG: Putting and 3 Putt Avoidance (Spieth & Brooks).
11040	11040	13	13	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At his worst, he’s a grinder who can get you to the weekend. Keegan Bradley  If you have a pacemaker, please, for your own safety, do not roster Keegan. The stress will have you in the emergency room.
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
12058	12058	32	32	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I especially like him in cash games because his $7,500 price tag gives you a solid cut-maker with upside and saves some salary-cap space for other high-end options. -- Jeff Bergerson  Emiliano Grillo  Although Grillo faded down the stretch at the Hero Indian Open and is flying across the world to play this week, he still offers excellent value at his price tag. He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season.
1206	1206	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And he also showed it when winning this tournament two years ago. Reed posted 21-under on that occasion before showing his one-to-one skills by defeating compatriot Jimmy Walker in a play-off. There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
13228	13228	14	15	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a decent week at Augusta and should do well here with his length. Luke Donald – It’s hard to look past Donald at Hilton Head, despite him never winning there. His record speaks for itself so he should contend.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
12285	12285	101	102	target: Harris English. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi; 9) Fabian Gomez; 10) Richy Werenski; 11) Brice Garnett / Graeme McDowell / Rory Sabbatini; 14) Tim Herron; 15) Ben Crane; 16) Scott Piercy; 17) Alex Cejka / Joel Dahmen / Tyler Duncan; 20) Davis Love III. Greens in Regulation : 1) Scott Piercy; 2) Sam Ryder; 3) Emiliano Grillo; 4) Corey Conners; 5) J.J. Henry; 6) Denny McCarthy / Rory Sabbatini; 8) Kevin Tway; 9) Andrew Putnam; 10) Nate Lashley; 11) Davis Love III; 12) Tyler Duncan / Xin-Jun Zhang; 14) Jonathan Byrd; 15) Brett Stegmaier; 16) Tim Herron / Adam Schenk; 18) Martin Flores / Keith Mitchell; 20) Harris English. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Ricky Barnes; 2) Emiliano Grillo; 3) Lanto Griffin; 4) Andres Romero; 5) Greg Chalmers / Michael Kim; 7) Scott Piercy; 8) David Lingmerth; 9) Troy Merritt; 10) Harris English / Trey Mullinax; 12) Jim Furyk / Tom Lovelady; 14) Fabian Gomez / Mike Weir; 16) Martin Flores / Ethan Tracy; 18) Robert Garrigus / Ricky Werenski; 20) Johnson Wagner.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
11875	11875	2	3	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
1589	1589	27	29	target: Charles Howell III: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer has always had an erratic streak that has kept him from ascending to the upper echelons, and this was yet another week that exemplifies that tendency. Charles Howell III: Another week, another top 15 finish from CH3. The transition to PXG and recovery from his injury late last season have clearly returned Chalk Howell back to his prominent, consistent form.
10658	10658	35	36	target: Matt Kuchar; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Kevin Streelman; 3) Billy Horschel; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Chez Reavie; 6) Kevin Kisner / Shane Lowry / Pat Perez; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Scott Piercy; 11) Matt Kuchar; 12) Bryson DeChambeau / Russell Knox; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Corey Conners / Rory McIlroy; 18) Branden Grace; 19) Jason Kokrak / Andrew Putnam; 20) Austin Cook / Charley Hoffman / Sam Ryder / Gary Woodland. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Padraig Harrington; 3) Phil Mickelson; 4) Jon Rahm; 5) Matt Kuchar; 6) Kevin Kisner; 7) Chris Stroud; 8) Rafael Cabrera-Bello; 9) James Hahn / Maverick McNealy; 11) Gary Woodland; 12) Dominic Bozzelli / Whee Kim / Vaughn Taylor; 15) Brian Gay / Peter Malnati; 17) Branden Grace; 18) David Lingmerth; 19) Austin Cook / Retief Goosen / Cody Gribble / Ben Martin / Pat Perez. Winners & Prices : 2017: Spieth 9/1 ; 2016: Taylor 300/1 ; 2015: Snedeker 25/1 ; 2014: Walker 28/1 ; 2013: Snedeker 14/1 ; 2012: Mickelson 25/1 ; 2011: Points 80/1 ; 2010: Johnson 22/1 ; Average: 63/1.
1373	1373	6	6	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winners for this week. Xander 100/1, Harkins 150/1 and Brazel 140/1. All ew.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
13682	13682	24	24	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
11875	11875	2	2	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
8724	8724	19	20	target: (Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens are smaller than average and sectioned into quadrants. Don't discount the fact that the last two winners here (Jason Day and Zach Johnson) are among the tour's best putters. In addition to the aforementioned dexterity with the flatstick, aptitude with the driver (distance preferred!)
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
8577	8577	7	8	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Why not make it back to back? Paul Casey – $9,000  Even though he doesn’t win, Paul Casey loves to get out of the gates hot and wind up inside the top 15 in some way. It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
11365	11365	37	37	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5 couldn’t get much going here last year when shooting 70-72-71-71 to finish T38 but expect a real improvement on that. Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
1309	1309	0	1	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama  Price: $11,000  I wrote last week that I was going to continue to roll with Matsuyama until he cools off, and that's not changing now. Dating back to last fall, here's how the scintillating-hot 24-year-old has fared in his last six events: win, second place to Justin Thomas, win, win, win, second place to Justin Thomas. At some point he's going to finish outside of the Top 2, and there's a good chance that happens at Waialae, where he has three missed cuts (all as an amateur) and a DNF (2015), but he's just playing too well to fade right now.
5512	5512	25	26	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1.
540	540	4	4	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
2024	2024	38	39	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the top 5s won’t happen every week, Rose is coming off a T6 finish here last year, and oh by the way, he’s currently leading the PGA in strokes gained tee-to-green, scoring average, and pre-cut scoring average. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – That’s right, I’m hopping back in the Jimmy horse. He might’ve kicked me off twice already this season, but COME ON!
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
6513	6513	45	46	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s going to be plenty of bogeys this week, so we need birdies to offset the damages. The top-10 in this field in recent birdie or better percentage are Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson, Tony Finau, Stewart Cink, Kevin Streelman, Grayson Murray, Boo Weekley, James Hahn, Patrick Reed, and Xander Schauffele. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Patrick Reed ($11,200)  This guy is going to win, and he’s going to win soon.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
10436	10436	23	24	target: Harris English, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price. Harris English, $8500 – About halfway down the salary list we see English, and no, this is not a misinterpretation. But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
2623	2623	1	1	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
7589	7589	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not only is there a lack of top talent besides DJ, but the ownership projects on the golfers in the $8K range is down right criminal. Currently, Kevin Chappell has seven tags on FanShareSports, which doesn’t even come close to the golfers priced ahead of him. Chappell arguably a top five golfer in this field, but is will likely come in at under 10% ownership.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
11363	11363	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
10129	10129	10	10	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So why not use the CareerBuilder as a tune-up? Beyond Rahm, Brian Harman, on the heel of his recent HOT FIYA run, is the only other member of the world’s top 20 in the CareerBuilder field. Failing to convert another 36-hole lead at the Sony Open, the 3-foot-7 Harman is one of 10 players teeing it up for the third consecutive week to begin the year.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
1478	1478	22	23	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$10million+ Salary Players :  Positive: We have 6 players over the $10 million threshold this week which is something new for 2017. Bill Haas takes some beating from a consistency level - he's Mr PGA West - and although the move to a tricky Pete Dye Stadium Course has not helped the Carolinian in any sense, you would be crazy to leave him out of your roster if you want a +$10m spear-head. Zach Johnson is the other that appeals to me on the basis he made 21 birdies and an eagle last week, in what was far and away his best PGA Tour outing since the 2015 Barclays tournament.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
11766	11766	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style. Matt Kuchar – Cash – DK: $8200 FD: $10600  Although last weekend was rough for Matt Kuchar, I have full confidence to go back to him in cash game contests this week.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
5154	5154	43	44	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the highest purse behind only the four majors, THE PLAYERS, and the four WGC events, there’s plenty to get excited about in Columbus this week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – William McGirt  2015 – David Lingmerth  2014 – Hideki Matsuyama  2013 – Matt Kuchar  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Justin Rose  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – K.J. Choi    Key Stats to Winning at Muirfield Village    • Driving Distance  • Par-5 Scoring  • Scrambling percentage    Champion’s Profile    As only Jack would have it, Muirfield’s par-5s are scoring holes and the greens are lightning-quick.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
6636	6636	21	22	target: Curtis Luck 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the defending champion of the Greenbrier Classic - why should you keep an eye on him this weekend? And finally, Curtis Luck might be just a rookie - but why might he surprise the field in Virginia? Tune in to find you that and more!
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
4411	4411	1	1	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler took the title in 2015 and although his course record is feast or famine he can scarcely have arrived in better form. Fowler currently leads the tour in adjusting scoring average and it’s difficult to find any chinks in his armour. He missed the cut in New Orleans but that was a team format, when it comes to stroke play his record in 2017 is MC-4-1-16-12-3-11.
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
3904	3904	9	9	target: Charley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Charley Hoffman ($10,700) – This week’s Luke Donald, Charley has never finished worse than T13 in seven tries at TPC San Antonio, including a win last year. He clearly has a supreme level of comfort here, and for this price, you’d have a very hard time finding a good reason to fade him.
463	463	2	2	target: Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Thoughts on Brehm at $5900 on DK? 9th in DD / 33rd in BirdieAvg on @WebDotComTour last year. Slow greens neutralize poor putting... #DFS
6759	6759	9	10	target: Zach Johnson). 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steve Stricker from the Cheesehead state and Iowa native Zach Johnson). Take a look at the previous winners below:  2009 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2011 – Steve Stricker (Yes Back to Back to Back)  2012 – Zach Johnson  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2015- Jordan Spieth  2016 – Ryan Moore  You can start to notice a trend with the players that have won here, they are great putters on the green. TPC Deere Run is a Par 71 playing at 7,268 yards.
2122	2122	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
13267	13267	24	25	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Editor’s Note: Adam Hadwin has withdrawn from this week’s RBC Heritage Open. Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Marc Leishman, Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Kuchar, Brian Harman, Kevin Kisner, Charley Hoffman, Xander Schauffele, Francesco Molinari, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ian Poulter, Cameron Smith, Webb Simpson, Adam Hadwin, Si-WOOOO Kim, Satoshi Kodaira, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Martin Kaymer, Vijay Singh and Bryson Dechambeau are all in the 2018 Heritage field, and each one played the weekend in Augusta. Patrick Cantlay, Jason Dufner, Kevin Chappell, Ross Fisher, Dylan Frittelli, Charl Schwartzel, Ted Potter Jr., Billy Horschel, Doc Redman, Austin Cook and defending champion Wes Bryan all had aspirations of donning the Green Jacket, but that dream ended on Friday for them.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
8939	8939	38	39	target: Gary Woodland. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's joined by the Tour Championship winner Xander Schauffele and runner-up here 12 months ago Hideki Matsuyama. This week's field also includes Tour Championship qualifiers Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Adam Hadwin, Pat Perez, Kyle Stanley, Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland. Throw-in talented players of the ilk of course winner Anirban Lahiri, Branden Grace, Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel and Thomas Pieters.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
4057	4057	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
12398	12398	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're chasing and have no qualms about sending anyone out, zone in on the last four champions – Day (2014, 2016), McIlroy (2015) and Dustin Johnson (2017). Day and DJ could square off in the quarterfinals, but you already knew that. Bring it on.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
9538	9538	45	46	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fairways are some 50-60 yards wide, roughly double what the golfers see most of the year, and the greens are enormous by Tour standards, averaging more than 7,000 square feet. Every winner since 2010 has finished top-10 in putting average – the last two, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, were first. Larger greens normally weed out the poor putters.
7570	7570	18	18	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
2320	2320	40	41	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t expect much different this week either. Beyond Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas, all the top ranked players in the field are internationals: Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Branden Grace, Russell Knox, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Francesco Molinari, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald and Thomas Pieters. We even get a quartet of Brits making the trek to America for the first time this year: Danny Willet, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ty Hatton and Ian Poulter.
2471	2471	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking. Garcia was excellent off-the-tee last week, but struggled mightily on the greens. He should be in for some positive regression this week.
12175	12175	13	13	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he's converting on the greens, he has us at, "Cheers!" If both Woods and Rose are available to you, they might as well just line up as your picks for the API and the Masters in whichever quinella you prefer. We're treated to the steady contributions of Tommy Fleetwood and Alex Noren again this week, but they'll be there again for us at next week's Match Play where no one will want to square off against either.
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12033	12033	28	29	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
5434	5434	20	20	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell could easily fall between the cracks as he is competing with this week’s chalk, Kyle Stanley at $8,400. If Chappell hadn’t won a few weeks back at the Valero Texas Open, I honestly believe this would be the event we all would be saying was his to win. William McGirt – $7,300  Why is nobody talking about McGirt?!
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
119	119	46	47	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tournament Skill Averages :  Driving Distance: 32nd, Driving Accuracy: 22nd, Greens in Regulation: 12th, Proximity to Hole: 20th, Scrambling: 30th, Putting Average 27th. So let's take a view from players as to how Bethpage Black played at the 2012 Barclays and what specific skills it requires:  Bubba Watson : "I think it'll be a tough test. Again, that's the only time I've played it, so I don't know if they can firm up the greens.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
12789	12789	33	34	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five of the world's top 10 have already won in 2018, with Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy picking up victories as recently as the Florida Swing. Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
1760	1760	46	46	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
8940	8940	43	44	target: Gary Woodland; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) Jim Herman; 13) Paul Casey; 14) Graeme DeLaet / Richy Werenski; 16) Hao Tong Li / Brendan Steele; 18) Jason Dufner / Lucas Glover; 20) Rafael Cabrera-Bello.

5941	5941	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect a thrilling finish and bounce backs from McIlroy and Day, who both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Russell Knox  2015 – Bubba Watson  2014 – Kevin Streelman  2013 – Ken Duke  2012 – Marc Leishman  2011 – Fredrik Jacobsen  2010 – Bubba Watson  2009 – Kenny Perry  2008 – Stewart Cink  2007 – Hunter Mahan    Key Stats to Winning at TPC River Highlands    • Par Breakers percentage  • Par 4 scoring average  • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green    Champion's Profile    With an interesting list of both short and long hitters claiming victories in the past, it is clear length has little to do with winning on one of the PGA Tour’s shortest courses. Plenty of shorter holes means birdies can come in bunches and are essential to success here, so look for players with high par-breaker percentages as quality candidates.
539	539	2	2	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
2621	2621	10	10	target: Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nobody hits a 3-wood with more confidence and accuracy than Stenson. Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.
10204	10204	35	36	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas scares me in cash games, but I totally understand the play if you want to use him in those, as well. -- Taras Pitra  Editor's Picks Weekly 18: Rory McIlroy came back strong, will Tiger Woods do so, too? Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.
950	950	15	15	target: Laird, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not walking out on any thin-limbs this week, but 7k guys I prefer: Streelman, Cink, Laird, Cook, &amp; Tway Will be h… https://t.co/7L4lUOsO9J
439	439	3	4	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
12507	12507	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Be aggressive. Phil Mickelson: "The style of play here is totally different than Augusta. The rope is at 300 yards or so off the tee, everything pitches in here and every tee shot has a hazard in play.
10283	10283	58	59	target: 2016—Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There doesn’t appear to be a huge advantage in stacking tee times at the moment; although, if one of the first two days’ forecasts improves a bit, it might be better to have your player on the South course when the weather is better. Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
4863	4863	47	48	target: Jason Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Amazingly Jon Rahm heads the betting, which is a measure of his meteoric rise along with the lack of strength in depth in the field. The Spaniard is a class act but I think the title might be heading to another elite ball-striker in the shape of Jason Dufner. Twice a runner-up at Colonial he finished T6 last year and it’s clearly a course he gets on well with.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.

12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
6424	6424	2	3	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: DQ  Bryson DeChambeau 0.75pt EW 90/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Bryson DeChambeau is a little like a box of chocolates, you just never know what you are going to get. However, this is the kind of low-key tournament where a talent like DeChambeau could fire, challenge and more than likely take the title. If we're looking for a motive, it appears that Bryson has noticed that he's outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and clearly he doesn't want to go through the stress of the web.com Playoffs again.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
1628	1628	30	30	target: Snedeker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one shot adrift when play resumed on the Monday, but winds from the opposite direction meant Jimmy Walker, Kevin Streelman and most notably KJ Choi failed to better Snedeker. Choi bogied No.14 to fall behind Snedeker and he failed to make up for this. Snedeker’s -6 winning score was the highest at Torrey Pines since 1979 and the average final-round score was 77.9 last year.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
13091	13091	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t putt. The last time Scott gained strokes on the green was at the WGC Bridgestone last July. Not great, Bob.
3679	3679	27	27	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
11205	11205	30	30	target: Garcia's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago. The week before, he won the Singapore Open.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
6184	6184	70	70	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s failed to finish better than T30 since The Masters and keeps falling victim to blow up rounds (80 at US Open, 78 at Memorial, 76 at the PLAYERS, 82 at Valero). Still, he plays the shorter courses well, and he’s only one of eight players in the field to have teed off in both Web events at this venue (T47: 2013; T25: 2012)… Lee is basically the opposite of Hadwin. He was brutal when the calendar flipped, but has been spitting HOT FIYA for just over a month now.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
1637	1637	45	46	target: Kyle Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 5 winners  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top ten performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016). The other three either hadn’t played for at least 3 weeks or finished outside the top 50 the week prior.
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
6390	6390	8	9	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Greenbrier  1. Patrick Reed  2. Bill Haas  3.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
13639	13639	32	33	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Henrik Stenson, Zach Johnson, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
1006	1006	5	6	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whee Kim - $7,400  5. Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods – $10,000  Personal note – I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.
3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
8431	8431	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth. 1 - Jonas Blixt, Keegan Bradley, Jason Dufner, Emiliano Grillo, Bill Haas, James Hahn, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Hideki Matsuyama, William McGirt, Geoff Ogilvy, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Scott Stallings, Brendan Steele, Henrik Stenson, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland.
3599	3599	28	29	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
6178	6178	34	35	target: Rory McIlroy: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ultimately, we're looking at another second-shot golf course this week with greens in regulation percentage, proximity to the hole, and iron play from 150 to 200 yards key this week. Creme de la Creme  Rory McIlroy: $11,600  If Rory McIlroy doesn't barnstorm his way around this course and make one million birdies, he's not Rory McIlroy. Seriously.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
4634	4634	106	107	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
11226	11226	62	63	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Bob Harig  Daniel Berger  Neither form nor recent course history seems like it's on his side -- he MC'd in last week's Genesis Open and each of the last two editions of the Honda -- but he's played well so far this year and is back on home turf at an event where he once reached a playoff. -- Jason Sobel  Luke Donald  Donald has his spots on the PGA Tour, and this is one of them. The fact that he was able to make the cut last week and not finish last on a course that rewards strong off the tee play is a good thing.
6002	6002	9	9	target: Leishman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TRAVELERS CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE HISTORY : THE GOOD  1. Marc Leishman, $9,300  Leishman has played this event in each of the last five years, making the cut each time and never finishing worse than 39th. It’s a run which includes a win in 2012, an 11th in 2014 and a ninth last year.
1815	1815	4	5	target: Hideki Matsuyama: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Creme de la Creme  Hideki Matsuyama: $11,700  Last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama hasn't finished worse than fourth at TPC Scottsdale. While he's coming off a ho-hum weekend showing at the Farmers, Matsuyama's track record and recent form puts him at the top of the heap. 18th on tour in strokes gained: off-the-tee this season and third on tour in strokes gained: approaching the green last year, Matsuyama fits the “power and precision off the tee" and “great iron player" profile of WMPO winners.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
4959	4959	52	53	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
6550	6550	21	22	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We aren’t playing a lot of cash games this week due to the field strength, but we love Keegan in GPPs. Gary Woodland $7,500 – Woodland hasn’t sniffed a top ten since we were wearing sweaters in Georgia, but he’s a consistent cut maker with the upside to win potentially. He’s a bomber that can take advantage of these forgiving fairways.
486	486	34	35	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston. Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week.
13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.
10283	10283	59	59	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There doesn’t appear to be a huge advantage in stacking tee times at the moment; although, if one of the first two days’ forecasts improves a bit, it might be better to have your player on the South course when the weather is better. Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top-10 performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016).
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
10396	10396	22	22	target: Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cherry Hills: Winner: Billy Horschel; EW Places: Watson, Hoffmann, Fowler, Palmer. TPC Summerlin: Winner: Ben Martin; EW Places: Streelman, Knox, Simpson, Finau, Piercy. 2015 :  Old White: Winner: Danny Lee; EW Places: Streb, Henley, Hahn.
12025	12025	29	30	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
5267	5267	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			24th in strokes gained: total. Charley Hoffman: $6,500  A definite head-scratcher priced this low, Charley Hoffman is 15th on Tour this season in strokes gained: off-the-tee and 29th in strokes gained: tee-to-green. In other words, another solid player here, folks.
12984	12984	41	41	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Noren ticks a lot of boxes here ranking 48th in GIR, 16th in SGTTG, 17th in strokes gained putting, 26th in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. After a missed cut on his only appearance here last year, Noren arrives in much better form this time around. Kiradech Aphibarnrat 100/1  The in form Thai looks great value here this week given his current run of form.
10284	10284	14	15	target: 2016—Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 5 winners  2017—Jon Rahm -13 (over Charles Howell III and CT Pan -10)  2016—Brandt Snedeker -6 (over K.J. Choi -5)  Choi -5) 2015—Jason Day -9 (over J.B. Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff)  Holmes, Harris English, Scott Stallings playoff) 2014—Scott Stallings -9 (over multiple players -8)  2013—Tiger Woods -14 (over Brandt Snedeker -10)  2012—Brandt Snedeker -16 (over Kyle Stanley playoff)  Winning Trends  Recent form does not seem to be a huge deal at this event (at least for the winners) as only one of the last five were coming off a top-10 performance the week before (Snedeker in 2012 and 2016). The other four either hadn’t played for at least three weeks or finished outside the top 30 the week prior.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
7905	7905	16	16	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also the defending champ at Firestone, a course that suits him. -- Bob Harig  Adam Scott  Adam has been playing this event since 2003 and hasn't missed one since that first start! The good news; Scott is coming off a reasonable showing at the Open (T-22) and last year he finished T-10 at this event.
7934	7934	44	44	target: Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CAVEAT: putting is so variable week to week that it’s never good to rely on that, but with such a strong game in getting to the green, even if Rickie putts poorly this week he’ll still be in contention. Value Picks (Below $7600):  Thomas Pieters ($7500): Unfortunately this won’t be a week where Pieters gets overlooked at an excellent price like at Augusta or the Open, after his excellent performance at the WGC Bridgestone (sitting in first place at the time of writing) – as an aside, Firestone CC is a decent comparable course for Quail Hollow. Pieters still gets his feature in this space for the second week in a row thanks to his excellent iron play which will be so crucial this week, and his ability to absolutely smash the ball off the tee when needed.
3239	3239	48	48	target: Peterson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Total Points staked this week: 3  Profit/Loss for 2017: – 36  I have purposely kept stakes to a minimum this week, as I didn’t want to get too involved in this event. Horschel was too obvious to ignore, whilst I have been looking for a chance to back Peterson, and Texas is as arguably the best place to get him on side. Ross Fisher looked like giving us a run for our money last week, only to be knocked out by Hideto Tanihara in the quarter finals.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can’t look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
1261	1261	12	12	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			LETS DO THIS!!!!! NORTH COURSE STACK!!!!! Spaun +8000 Cink +10000 Chesson +10000 Wise +12500 Mullinax +15000 Post… https://t.co/3EHQym9alE
1445	1445	4	4	target: @BrandtSnedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First #ATTProAm bet is @BrandtSnedeker at 49/1. Snedeker absolutely loves Pebble Beach and has two wins here since… https://t.co/vL4CebF7GI
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.

20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
5708	5708	20	21	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rosie’s price tag is too cheap, and he’s consistently overlooked in majors on DraftKings despite a great performance. Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,500 – “Kiz” joined us on the Tour Junkies Podcast this week after seeing Erin Hills and believes that it’s going to come down to keeping it in the fairway off the tee, chipping off these tight lies around the greens, and solid putting. Basically…that’s Kevin Kisner!
12383	12383	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
4303	4303	21	22	target: Bud Cauley. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With those injury doubts, I'm willing to let him go there. The other player with a hat-trick of top 10s is Bud Cauley. Okay, they're of a different variety and one was even in a pairs event last week when he finished T5 alongside Justin Thomas in New Orleans.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
4101	4101	23	24	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last eight starts, his WORST finish is T-13, and he has won here. And we give you Adam Hadwin (ballstriker) and Luke Donald, who only played here once, but was T-13 and showed some good form last week. Charley Hoffman, who is money at this event.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
12241	12241	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
13299	13299	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he is priced as the 11th– most expensive player on DK, DailyRoto gives Hatton the fourth-best win probability (2.66%). Putting and short game are going to be a huge factor this week and Hatton is fifth in SG Putting and fourth in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green. This is a steal at just $8,800.
4517	4517	31	31	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 17 starts, Sergio has missed the cut twice! If there's one guy who could be called the horse for this course, it would be Sergio Garcia.. -- Michael Collins  Rickie Fowler  In 2015, Fowler played world-class golf down the closing stretch at TPC Sawgrass to win the Players Championship and plant his flag in the fairway as a world class player, following the "overrated" narrative that started in the media. Now a year removed from the hype of repeating, Fowler has the game to win again at the newly renovated course.
7016	7016	42	43	target: Scott Brown, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(2-4% projected ownership via Fantasy Labs)  Also Consider: Johnson Wagner (three straight top tens at TPC Deere Run), Patrick Rodgers, Ollie Schiniderjans, Wesley Bryan (3/4 recently and finished T8 here last year, but may end up being a trendy pick), Geoff Ogilvy, Scott Brown, Trey Mullinax, and Harold Varner III. We can’t expect the world out of this 23 year old in his first time playing in this event, but I think this is a great chance to buy low on Murray right now, as most DFS players may still be bitter about last week. Also when not including the two and half holes he played last week, Murray has been rolling it much better over his last five starts, posting a low 27.2 average putts per round.
778	778	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
6544	6544	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
7479	7479	3	4	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Open’s runner-up, Matt Kuchar, is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Kuchar has finished inside the top-10 here in each of the past three years the Canadian Open has been played at Glen Abbey: His 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks second in this week’s field. But it’s not just Kuchar’s course history that’s hot like fiya: Kuchar’s 67.4 Recent Adj Rd Score leads the field, thanks in part to six straight finishes of 16th or better, including three finishes of fourth or better.
2601	2601	2	2	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
5107	5107	11	11	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I really thought I could have got to that magic number." Scott looks a danger on any suitable course right now and this must count as one of them. Take the 25s.
10569	10569	14	15	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he’s playing well again and was T-12 at Farmers last week. Also like: Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
11974	11974	16	17	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I do not hate the idea of a Day-Noren playoff for the second time this year. Henrik Stenson ($9100) – People will most likely be off of him due to his poor performance last week. It hopefully will not take much to be overweight on Stenson and he has great history (minus last year).
6207	6207	56	75	target: David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Boo Weekley; 3) Ben Crane; 3) Spencer Levin; 4) Tim Wilkinson; 5) Kyle Stanley; 6) Graham DeLaet; 7) Jim Herman / Daniel Summerhays; 9) David Hearn; 10) Zac Blair / D.A. Points; 12) Keegan Bradley / J.J. Spaun; 14) Chris Kirk / David Lingmerth; 16) Ben Martin / Johnson Wagner; 18) Martin Laird / Kyle Reifers; 20) K.J. Choi / Nick Taylor / Vaughn Taylor.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
100	100	18	18	target: Lindheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
13126	13126	8	9	target: Matt Every, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - K.J. Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Fabian Gomez, Billy Horschel, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Davis Love III, Ryan Palmer, Brandt Snedeker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Graeme McDowell, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, John Senden, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Nick Watney.
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
12220	12220	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
4518	4518	22	22	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If there's one guy who could be called the horse for this course, it would be Sergio Garcia.. -- Michael Collins  Rickie Fowler  In 2015, Fowler played world-class golf down the closing stretch at TPC Sawgrass to win the Players Championship and plant his flag in the fairway as a world class player, following the "overrated" narrative that started in the media. Now a year removed from the hype of repeating, Fowler has the game to win again at the newly renovated course. He has four top-10s already this year, was in contention at the Masters until falling off on Sunday, and leads the PGA Tour in adjusted scoring average.
2908	2908	14	15	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Jason Day; 2) Hideki Matsuyama; 3) James Hahn; 4) Tommy Fleetwood; 5) Tiger Woods; 6) Cameron Smith; 7) Emiliano Grillo / Patton Kizzire / Alex Noren; 10) Chesson Hadley; 11) Marc Leishman; 12) Charl Schwartzel; 13) Brian Harman / Si Woo Kim; 15) Austin Cook / Justin Rose / Sam Saunders; 18) Tyrrell Hatton; 19) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Zach Johnson / Ollie Schniederjans / Chris Stroud. Winners & Prices : 2017: Leishman 100/1 ; 2016: Day 14/1 ; 2015: Every 300/1 ; 2014: Every 66/1 ; 2013: Woods 3/1 ; 2012: Woods 8/1 ; 2011: Laird 45/1 ; 2010: Els 16/ 1; Average: 69/1.
13319	13319	54	56	target: Si Woo Kim, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously I say this with my tongue firmly in my cheek as my reasons for siding with Beau again this week go way beyond any kind of misguided loyalty. No, my main reason for backing Beau again this week is how hugely impressive I felt he was down the stretch in Houston and, unlike Si Woo Kim, until a couple of loose shots in the play off you could lay no fault at Beau’s door for him not taking the trophy home that week. Had this performance come out of the blue I would perhaps have been a bit more cautious but of course Hossler has been talked about as a potentially huge star of the game in the making for a long while now and he has been producing some good stuff on the tour all season without putting four rounds together until it all clicked in Houston.
239	239	61	62	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members. It does not get any better than this anywhere in the industry.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
4408	4408	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Probably not. But he definitely should be in contention through Sunday… You could swerve on to Ryan Moore here, or eat the chalk with Matt Kuchar, but I’ll be rolling with Walker. A gamble?
12033	12033	28	28	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
11582	11582	16	17	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think most will avoid because of the names around him and last week. Tier 2  Adam Hadwin $7,500 – Another guy who played well at the Genesis. He didn’t play here last year, but I like what I saw a couple weekends ago.
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.
5786	5786	12	162	target: Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win: Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300 And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada: Golfer April 17, 2017 (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017 (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
6606	6606	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can be tilting to follow live so I don’t recommend watching every shot. However, at this price Finau can allow you to avoid having to punt in cash games. Danny Lee ($16,400) – A former winner at this event, Danny Lee is riding a hot streak.
10986	10986	13	14	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be decently low owned with all the names in this range. Bubba Watson $7,800 – Pretty good price for a guy who has won here twice. He is getting some form back, so I will try and hop on before he is super chalk.
10252	10252	12	13	target: Jhonattan Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like Brendan in cash or GPP lineups. Embed from Getty Images  Jhonattan Vegas $7,700 – Jhonny V is in tremendous form coming off a solid week at the CareerBuilder where he continued making birdies in bunches. Like Steele, he’s gained 19 strokes on the field in the last five years at Torrey Pines.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
2601	2601	1	2	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
3673	3673	0	1	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Luke Donald ($7,800) – Donald’s certainly not a guy we rely on week to week, but at certain spots, he’s just ridiculous – this one of them. Since 2009, Donald has carded four (4) runner-up finishes along with two third-place finishes. It’s not hard to understand why with his particular skill set, but no matter how little you’d normally trust him, this is the spot to set that aside.
383	383	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jason Day  Vegas Odds - 8/1  Draftkings - $12,500  FantasyAces - $6,200  What stood out to me more than anything last week was how awful Jason Day was off the tee(35% Driv Acc and ranked 72nd in SG:OTT) yet he was still able to finish T4 shooting a seven under par. Despite having to hit out of the rough for the majority of the four days he still had close to a 70% GIR(ranked T19) and led the field in SG:Putting.
11784	11784	42	43	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a near-miss last week with Justin Thomas but he still returned a $1MM+ payday so it's hard to complain there. For this week's Valspar, let's start with some historical horses at the Copperhead Course:      Jason Dufner (9-for-10 with seven top 25s)  Henrik Stenson (4-T11-T7)  Matt Kuchar (9-for-10 with seven T22 or better)  Charl Schwartzel (MC-WIN-6)  Ryan Moore (7-for-11 with three top 10s)  Charles Howell III (11-for-14 with four top 10s)  Jim Furyk (8-for-9 with three top 10s including WIN)  Nick Watney (10-for-10 with five top 25s)  Bill Haas (6-for-9 with three T16 or betteR)  Patrick Reed (MC-T2-T7-T38)  John Huh (3-for-6 with T33-T22-T9 last three)  Luke Donald (8-for-9 with four top 10s including WIN)  Danny Lee (MC-T7-WD-T22; T19 when WD)  Jordan Spieth (T7-T20-WIN-T18)  Dominic Bozzelli (T3)        After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Jordan Spieth  Rory McIlroy  Henrik Stenson  Justin Rose  Sergio Garcia  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Brandt Snedeker  Louis Oosthuizen  Steve Stricker  Tony Finau  Patrick Reed  Zach Johnson  Webb Simpson    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, and Matt Kuchar.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
51	51	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lipsky &amp; Canizares in Switzerland and Reed and Woodland in the US for me this week. #golf #betting #tips
7091	7091	30	31	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut in the Irish Open last time but, against that negative, he posted a top 10 in France two starts ago and was T18 at Augusta National. Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
11165	11165	14	15	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why scrambling is so important this week. last year, Rickie Fowler and co-runners-up Gary Woodland and Morgan Hoffmann all finished top-10 in scrambling. The year before, the top-8 finishers were all top-12 in scrambling.
10543	10543	9	10	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the short list of truths to be self-evident, Hideki Matsuyama at the Waste Management Phoenix Open appears. No, the history doesn't predict the present, but we compete in an imperfect fantasy world. This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.
2393	2393	17	18	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Great price, cash worthy. Economy  Billy Horschel $7,200  Nick Watney $7,100  Kyle Stanley $7,100  Martin Flores $7,100  Stewart Cink $7,100  That’s it for this week. I think it is a great week to focus on cash games and build some bankroll.
282	282	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
197	197	142	143	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1151	1151	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY PICK : Henrik Stenson ($9,400)  It’s hard to pick one player to stand out from what is basically an all star field of golfers this week. Still, I do see this as an opportunity for Henrik Stenson to end his already amazing 2016 with a bang. Stenson won the Open Championship in maybe the most brilliant display of golf in a major ever, nearly won the Olympic gold and was just his usual cool self all year.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!
828	828	14	14	target: WEBB 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
5459	5459	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
3829	3829	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Brit returns to action at arguably his best course. Donald has never won at Harbour Town, but he has four runner-ups and two thirds. Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well.
1522	1522	0	0	target: CHOI 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CHOI has an impeccable record at Riviera. https://t.co/iNGBsDFpIs
9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.
2603	2603	27	27	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
12704	12704	54	55	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is also live coverage on BBC2 on Saturday and Sunday, and they also have Red Button coverage from mid-afternoon over the weekend, showing featured groups, Amen Corner, and holes 15 and 16. Last Ten Winners  2017 - Sergio Garcia -9 (playoff)  2016 - Danny Willett -5  2015 - Jordan Spieth -18  2014 - Bubba Watson -8  2013 - Adam Scott -9 (playoff)  2012 - Bubba Watson -10 (playoff)  2011 - Charl Schwartzel -14  2010 - Phil Mickelson -16  2009 - Angel Cabrera -12 (playoff)  2008 - Trevor Immelman -8  What Will it Take to Win the US Masters? Sergio Garcia's stats were incredible last year and it's hardly surprising he won.
12014	12014	1	1	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
13621	13621	64	65	target: Tommy Fleetwood; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) John Senden; 3) Emiliano Grillo / Kyle Stanley; 5) Keegan Bradley; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Daniel Berger; 8) Ryan Blaum; 9) Adam Hadwin / Brian Harman; 11) Alex Cejka / Tommy Fleetwood; 13) Jonathan Randolph; 14) Andrew Landry; 15) Kevin Kisner; 16) Vaughn Taylor; 17) Fabian Gomez / Alex Noren / Ted Potter Jnr / Webb Simpson / Kevin Streelman.

439	439	4	4	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
6042	6042	45	46	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We saw Kevin Streelman win here by shooting 64-64 on the weekend, including a finish of seven consecutive birdies. Relying on recent stats, the field leaders in SGP are Steve Wheatcroft, Justin Thomas, Jim Herman, Julian Etulain, Jason Day, Greg Chalmers, Kevin Streelman, Whee Kim, Brandt Snedeker, and Bubba Watson. Birdie or Better % (BoB%): There are not many weeks where we aren’t going to target birdie or better percentage because that’s what fantasy golf scoring is all about.
4730	4730	30	30	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament. Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him.
320	320	2	2	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gone with @Thomas_Pieters at 80/1 in the @WGCMexico. Pieters was second at Riviera recently and this course may share some similarities
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
196	196	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bethpage is a lengthy 7,468-yard par 71 and although we have scant evidence to go on - the 2002 and 2009 US Opens along with this event in 2012 - it's easy to spot plenty of big hitters amongst the respective top 10s. Reed biffs it just a few yards short of 300 off the tee and that puts him in the top 50 in Driving Distance. He's about much more than that though as shown by his ninth spot in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green.

12241	12241	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's possible that Garcia's nous will see him through but I suspect he's vulnerable in one of the hardest groups to call. Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot.
327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.

11433	11433	20	20	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a much deserved week off, Rahm is back and priced as the third highest golfer. WIth DJ, JT and Fleetwood creating all the buzz at the top, Rahm is getting overlooked. He only has seven tags on FanShareSports, despite his T3 finish here last year.

7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w.

3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?

10598	10598	53	54	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2018 Waste Management Open field is loaded. Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley.
9520	9520	31	31	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
5969	5969	43	43	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut at Erin Hills and doesn't have the look of a top-5 player at the moment, but he showed promise at the Memorial and turned in a runner-up at the Nelson. If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open.
11432	11432	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood – $10,000  All aboard the Fleetwood train…once again. Make it three straight weeks of being in on Fleetwood and I apologize for being repetitive, but when a world class ball striker is affordable and a good course fit, he becomes a “jam him in” play. Fleetwood gained 6.1 strokes on approach shots at the Honda Classic last week, something we should start getting use to.
11789	11789	22	23	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Showing signs of life recently, I'm going to try to jump aboard before the masses jump back on the Texan. DraftKings Picks:    Henrik Stenson ($10,200): Don't have to pay a premium for the Orlando resident that has finished T11 or better in all three visits to the Valspar. Matt Kuchar ($8,200): Should see his ownership plummet after a poor putting performance in Mexico.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!

353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
4879	4879	46	47	target: Kevin Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson and Phil Mickelson are both two-time winners, Jordan Spieth was runner-up in 2015 before winning last year and 2015 champ Chris Kirk had a previous top five as well as making the top 15 the year before his win. So I'm naturally drawn to Kevin Kisner, who has a T10 and a T5 in the last two years. Kisner recovered from an over-par opener with 66-69-66 to sneak into the top 10 last year and in 2015 he posted three 67s and a 69 to finish just two shots behind winner Kirk.
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
8679	8679	104	105	target: Kevin Na; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Paul Casey / Henrik Stenson; 3) Jordan Spieth; 4) Hideki Matsuyama; 5) Marc Leishman; 6) Gary Woodland; 7) Rickie Fowler / Zach Johnson; 9) Sergio Garcia; 10) Charley Hoffman; 11) Lucas Glover; 12) Patrick Cantlay; 13) Russell Henley; 14) Jason Day / Luke List; 16) Hudson Swafford; 17) Jason Dufner / Dustin Johnson / Brendan Steele; 20) Francesco Molinari / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Brooks Koepka / Justin Thomas; 3) Jason Day; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Dustin Johnson; 6) Xander Schauffele; 7) Grayson Murray; 8) Rickie Fowler; 9) Jon Rahm; 10) Paul Casey / Kevin Na; 12) Webb Simpson / Robert Streb; 14) Henrik Stenson; 15) Hideki Matsuyama; 16) Matt Kuchar; 17) Ian Poulter; 18) Zach Johnson; 19) Patrick Reed; 20) Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices : 2016: D Johnson 10/1 ; 2015: Day 15/2 ; 2014: Horschel 66/1 ; 2013: Z Johnson 40/1 ; 2012: McIlroy 7/1 ; 2011: Rose 66/1 ; 2010: D Johnson 33/1 ; Average: 33/1.
10541	10541	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate teams are no fun and don't help anyone. FanDuel Picks:    Zach Johnson ($10,600): He's fully synced up with his latest equipment from PXG. Typically runs hot or cold, so I will keep riding the hot streak while it's here.
6965	6965	76	77	target: Rory Sabbatini; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
8862	8862	64	64	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has been playing some good golf lately and I look forward to seeing him play this week. He is a guy that has burned me more times than he has helped me out in Draftkings, but I have a feeling that a lot of other people will feel the same way and hopefully pivot to someone else in his price range like Kuchar, Garcia, Simpson, Reed, Hoffman, or Finau. I wouldn't call him a "core" player but he's the kind of guy you could see at the top of the leaderboard on Thursday and beat yourself up all weekend for not playing him.
10881	10881	34	35	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas hasn't produced his best stuff consistently this season despite flashes of brilliance and course form of 39-54-41 suggests there will be better opportunities down the line to play him. Main Bet: Back Martin Laird EW @ 100/1  After landing a big-each way return with 200/1 Scott Stallings last week, I did think about leaving some chips on the table and backing him again here at 100s. It's another California event with Poa Annua greens but course form of MC-66-45 isn't too sharp.
7092	7092	0	1	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Padraig Harrington  The Irishman closed out victory in style at Royal Birkdale in 2008 and looked all set to give himself the perfect boost ahead his return there when taking the 36-hole lead in last week’s Scottish Open. Harrington wobbled badly on Saturday when the weather turned nasty (missing short putts the main culprit) but bounced back to finish T4. Not that we needed it, but that was a timely reminder of how good the two-time Open champ can be on links courses and T17 in the Travelers adds to the feeling that he’s in a good place again.
9983	9983	25	25	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's jump in and take a look at this weeks tag counts. $10K Range  The top tier is small with just five golfers but Rahm, Harman, and Mickelson lead the way in the tag count with Rahm sitting with a commanding lead in start recommendations. I will have the most exposure to Mickelson in this tier but think there is a nice pivot opportunity with Patrick Reed.
6292	6292	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
7226	7226	28	29	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose. Yeah, it’s maybe too corny to happen.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.

4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!

8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
12707	12707	1	2	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely. I'm not sure how much credence we can give it but recent history suggests a late start on day one is beneficial as the last seven winners have all teed off late on day one.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
2920	2920	34	35	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The list goes on with legitimate cases quite feasible for Paul Casey, Tyrrell Hatton and Thomas Pieters but it's G-Mac at 50s that gets my vote. I will go for an American by taking Zach Johnson and making it a hat-trick of major winners on my team this week. The former Masters and Open champ is another with some impressive history here without actually winning.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
7023	7023	1	1	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events. There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event.
1254	1254	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And until we see otherwise, Day is still among the very best putters in the game. Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that.
11596	11596	4	4	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Mayo welcomes Deshaun Watson, Joe Theismann, Jermichael Finley, Jamie Erdahl, Greg Jennings, Matt Mitrione, Kathryn Tappen, Jamey Eisenberg and many more into the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row. SHOW INDEX 1:29 Deshaun Watson 32 Free View in iTunes  106 Clean 2018 Fantasy Football - Tuesday on Radio Row Special with Stefon Diggs and many more! Pat Mayo welcomes Stefon Diggs, Chris Rose, Road Warrior Animal, Andy Benoit, Judy Battista, Caleb Truax, and Dave Hunt to the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
11104	11104	75	76	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) David Lingmerth; 13) Blayne Barber / Sergio Garcia / Emiliano Grillo; 16) Chad Campbell; 17) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Billy Horschel; 19) Lucas Glover / Brian Harman / Chris Kirk / Brian Stuard. Greens in Regulation : 1) Russell Knox; 2) Tommy Fleetwood; 3) Tyrrell Hatton; 4) Billy Horschel / Alex Noren; 6) Keegan Bradley / Sergio Garcia / Martin Kaymer; 9) Dylan Frittelli / Scott Piercy; 11) Peter Uihlein; 12) John Peterson / Justin Thomas; 14) Gary Woodland; 15) Kevin Kisner / Adam Scott; 17) J.J. Henry / Patton Kizzire; 19) Kiradech Aphibarnrat / Chesson Hadley / Hudson Swafford. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Justin Thomas; 2) Jason Dufner; 3) Peter Malnati; 4) Tiger Woods; 5) Tyrrell Hatton; 6) Alex Noren; 7) Wesley Bryan; 8) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Rickie Fowler / Tommy Fleetwood / Sergio Garcia; 12) Padraig Harrington; 13) Austin Cook; 14) David Lingmerth / Bernd Wiesberger; 17) Brian Gay / Patton Kizzire; 19) Daniel Berger / Louis Oosthuizen / Ollie Schniederjans.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
6830	6830	11	13	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, let’s try and cultivate some John Deere Picks! Top Tier  Charles Howell III $9,000 – I like that we can roster him a little discount from last week. He hasn’t missed the cut here since 2012, which was his only one in 7 appearances.
2484	2484	31	31	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ could make mincemeat of this course, Spieth could putt the lights out and Rory will be fresh and raring to go again after his break. It's a simple truth that Garcia has never won a major or WGC event but he does have 22 top 10s in the former and 12 in the latter. Seven of his WGC top 10s have come in this event although it's obviously been played at different venues and all are, in fact, top sevens.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
2452	2452	18	19	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tee-to-green behemoth with the ability to dominate this golf course as he has so many others. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – So he shot an 80 at Riviera on a tough, windy day. That shouldn’t make him $1,800 cheaper than DJ.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
2028	2028	10	11	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
438	438	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also a former champion here, so I certainly won't talk you off of him in tournaments. Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
851	851	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has a power game that travels well. Brooks Koepka. Has a power game that travels well.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
6732	6732	99	101	target: Charles Howell III; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 main Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour; 2) Boo Weekley; 3) Chez Reavie; 4) Steve Alker / Ryan Moore / Steve Stricker; 7) Spencer Levin; 8) Ben Crane / Kyle Stanley; 10) Chad Campbell; 11) Tim Wilkinson; 12) Zac Blair / Daniel Summerhays; 14) Scott Brown; 15) Nick Taylor; 16) Zach Johnson / Johnson Wagner; 18) Kevin Kisner / William McGirt; 20) Danny Lee / J.J. Spaun. Greens in Regulation : 1) Charles Howell III; 2) J.J. Henry; 3) Ryan Armour / Ben Martin / Kyle Stanley; 6) Chad Campbell / Trey Mullinax; 8) Danny Lee; 9) Bud Cauley; 10) Steve Stricker / Nick Taylor; 12) Daniel Berger / Joel Dahmen / Charley Hoffman / Scott Stallings; 16) Luke List / Sean O'Hair / Daniel Summerhays; 19) Hunter Mahan / Nick Watney; 21) Spencer Levin. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Billy Hurley III; 2) Willy Wilcox; 3) Brian Harman; 4) Danny Lee; 5) Tag Ridings; 6) Grayson Murray; 7) Chez Reavie / Steve Stricker; 9) Daniel Berger / Wesley Bryan / Morgan Hoffmann / Jamie Lovemark; 13) Ryan Blaum / Ben Martin; 15) Charles Howell III / Smylie Kaufman; 17) Charley Hoffman / Kyle Stanley; 19) Zach Johnson; 20) Vaughn Taylor / Kevin Tway.
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
5077	5077	43	43	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first round W/Ds to his history, he hasn’t missed the cut here going back to 2008. There’s not a lot to dislike about Mickelson for cheap, and paired with Fleetwood he leaves a lot of room up top. Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week. Yahoo!
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
2571	2571	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrrell Hatton ($8,300): Coming off a fourth-place finish at last week’s Honda Classic — check out CSURAM’s Honda Lineup Review — I expect Hatton to be heavily owned in this week’s slate and for good reason: He’s really good at golf. Hatton has now ripped off nine consecutive top-25 finishes worldwide. He had back-to-back T3 finishes at Crans-sur Sierre in 2014 and 2015.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
2528	2528	47	47	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East. Fleetwood beat a field including Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson to land the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and while that event does tend to see the favourites come up short on what’s typically their first start in months, this year’s winner is good enough to use victory as a springboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time.
7323	7323	35	35	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
5720	5720	18	19	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency. His good run of form began back in January where he finished T4 at the windy Waialae Country Club, home of the Sony Open.
6148	6148	38	39	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall though, scoring conditions will likely be ideal throughout, so expect regular low scores here and possibly something in the high teens to win. Last six winners  2016 –- Russell Knox -14 (over Jerry Kelly -13)  2015 — Bubba Watson -16 (over Paul Casey in playoff)  2014 — Kevin Streelman -15 (over Sergio Garcia and KJ Choi -14)  2013 — Ken Duke -12 (over Chris Stroud in playoff)  2012 — Marc Leishman -14 (over Charley Hoffman and Bubba Watson -13)  2011 — Fredrik Jacobson -20 (over Ryan Moore and John Rollins -19)  Winning Trends  Four of the last seven winners of the Travelers have been first-time winners on the PGA Tour. Three of the last four winners of this event were coming into the week off of missed cuts in their previous start.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
12048	12048	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tyrell Hatton – FD Value – DK: $9000 FD: $10600  Although at this price point we do not necessarily think of value, Hatton is looking underpriced. A few weeks ago Hatton was the talk of everyone coming into the Honda Classic when he abruptly missed the cut. The following week Hatton’s ownership was much lower and we saw him finish T3 against a loaded field.
6873	6873	39	40	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In-Play Tactics    Moore sat third after round one and he was never headed form halfway but don't worry if your fancy has a poor first round as a slow start can be overcome at Deere Run. Steve Stricker and Zach Johnson have both won recently having trailed by seven strokes after round one and Spieth trailed by six after the opening day in 2013 and by eight two years later! Spieth was still five back at halfway in 2015 and he trailed by six shots after round three in 2013.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
6583	6583	10	10	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it. James Hahn – $8,800  In a week where Tony Finau looks to be the chalk, James Hahn will garner next to no ownership in a spot he could easily go off in.
8907	8907	49	50	target: Chesson Hadley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've read about this year's wave rather than seen much of them in action but, for this week, two who make plenty of birdies are Keith Mitchell and Denny McCarthy. However, it's another player still fresh off some excellent play in the Web.com finals who gets my third pick....        Chesson Hadley is no 21-year-old young buck ready to take the world by storm. He's a 30-year-old who knows that plenty of talent and early promise isn't a golden ticket to years and years of automatic success.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
4117	4117	43	44	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
11012	11012	12	12	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – Genesis Open  Lock of the week:  Paul Casey – $10,200 – The upper range on DraftKings presents some great options in this stellar field for the Genesis Open. We love the way Casey fits into GPP and cash lineups allowing you to avoid the fairly weak $6K range. He finished T8 last week at Pebble while leading the field in SG:T2G.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
7174	7174	23	23	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Sergio sees a lot of ownership because of this but I will still be overweight on him for the week. Henrik Stenson – GPP – DK: $9600 FD: $8700  Stenson is quietly showing good form just in time to defend his Open Championship title. With a T10 and a T26 in his last two events, I am not worried about his earlier season struggles.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.

12008	12008	3	3	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1561	1561	5	5	target: Bae 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Taken a chance on Sangmoon Bae at 169/1 and 13/2 for the top 20 in the #GenesisOpen. Bae loves Riviera and has fini… https://t.co/lpLOmpQz73
1010	1010	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk - $11,300  2. Charles Howell III - $9,200  3. Cody Gribble - $8,400  4.
8819	8819	38	38	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back him win only at 9/2. In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up.
11073	11073	45	45	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the event in 2012 and should have done again in 2014, 12 months after he withdrew with 'toothache' but he's missed out on weekend employment in each of the last two editions and I'm more than happy to swerve him. It's not often Sergio Garcia catches my eye before the off but I can certainly see him going well this week. Sergio is a regular here and with form figures reading 43-13-50-8-31-2-14 he's trending in the right direction and he won't mind the wind one iota.
8326	8326	543	544	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The MDF rule is in effect if more than 78 golfers make the original cut.

12383	12383	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
330	330	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed — It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it’s hard to see why he doesn’t deserve a look again this week. He’s in America Mode.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
4556	4556	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better time than the PLAYERS. Rickie Fowler – $9,300  It is all or nothing for Rickie Fowler at TPC Sawgrass. Literally.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
10796	10796	36	37	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not a disaster result, but let's look for something better at Pebble Beach. Let's start this week with some weighted tournament history:  Jason Day (8-for-8 with five T11 or better)  Brandt Snedeker (7-for-10 with two wins)  Dustin Johnson (9-for-10 with two wins)  Jon Rahm (T5)  Patrick Reed (5-for-5 with three top 15s)  Kelly Kraft (3-for-3 including RUNNER-UP last year)  Gary Woodland 1-for-3 with T5 last year)  Phil Mickelson (18-for-21 with four wins)  Jimmy Walker (8-for-10 with WIN and T3)  Matt Jones (9-for-10 with five top 25s)  Luke Donald (6-for-8 with six top 30s)  J.B. Holmes (10-for-11 with six top 25s)  Nick Watney (10-for-13 with three top 10s)  Mac Hughes (T10)  After that, let's look at a (weighted) baseline performance metric since the start of 2014. Dustin Johnson  Jordan Spieth  Rory Mcilroy  Jason Day  Jon Rahm  Paul Casey  Adam Scott  Matt Kuchar  Patrick Cantlay  Phil Mickelson  Austin Cook  Brandt Snedeker  Patrick Reed  Rafa Cabrera Bello    Looking at both lists, we see some overlap with the following names: Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker, Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, and Phil Mickelson.
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
5271	5271	9	10	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be high owned, so go big! Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,600 – It’s no secret Kiz is in great form after winning the Dean & Deluca last week. He’s an excellent putter on bentgrass greens, which we will see again this week at Memorial.
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
4729	4729	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I cannot remember the last time I saw his price this low, along with his betting odds at 16/1, which seem long for a field of this strength. Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
13317	13317	67	68	target: Si Woo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly as I mentioned earlier in the piece it may pay to look at a players past performance at the OHL Mayakoba as this is the other Greg Norman designed course played on the PGA Tour. Finally similarities have been drawn between the Oaks Course and Pete Dye design courses due to the run off areas around the greens and one thing we can’t do is doubt Si Woo’s liking for a Pete Dye design! It is these last three pointers that clinched it for me to roll the dice with Si Woo again this week and I am hoping he can add his name to the list of players who have memorably bounced back from heartbreak one week to win the next.
