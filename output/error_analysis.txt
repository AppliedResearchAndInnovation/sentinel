12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
284	284	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sweden's Henrik Stenson prepares to putt on the 5th hole on day three of the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links, Troon, Scotland, Saturday July 15, 2017. (Mark Runnacles/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)  IRVINE, Scotland (AP) — Henrik Stenson is pessimistic about his chances of successfully defending the British Open title at Royal Birkdale next week. The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
78	78	16	16	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Retief Goosen $7.1 million - just ask yourself again. I personally have big doubts about Rickie Fowler at $9.5 million as well. Naturally he could explode into tournament wining form at any point, but Fowler 2017-style to date has been a pale impersonation of 2016-style where he had already finished 5th at Kapalua and won in Abu Dhabi.
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
218	218	2	2	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week. All of that being said, I’m not sure this is the week I want to attack Justin Thomas. On a course that is going to be a second shot course that requires good proximity and scrambling and some accuracy off the tee, I don’t know that this track favors JT enough to really want to dive head first into rostering him too heavily in GPPs.
129	129	7	8	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms. Jason Day has had a rocky start to 2017 with one top 10 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and a missed cut.
144	144	3	3	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor. If you are going to tell me Brown is likely going to be highly owned at $9,800 when there are numerous options priced above and below him that are in better form, I will gladly fade Brown. Tyron Van Aswegen – $8,200  The price on Tyron Van Aswegen just doesn’t line up for me this week, even with the subpar field.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
51	51	13	14	target: Scott Piercy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			At this price he looks a great low ownership GPP play. The Fade:  Scott Piercy ($9,800) – Piercy has played well recently, but having performed when almost 20% owned last week, I feel like he’s going to be heavily owned again. With this track more focused on accuracy, I’m not convinced he can perform as well this week.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
344	344	20	21	target: Cameron Smith 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
281	281	14	15	target: Phil Mickelson. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brandt Snedeker ($6,800): Announced Wednesday he had to withdraw due to rib issue. Fade: Phil Mickelson. I’m not confident in Rory, but he could turn things around completely at any moment.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
70	70	43	44	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			But he’s back and of course he picks up a W along the way. Yearly Results:  Wins:1  Top 10’s 300/ top 5’s 1060/ top 3’s 5300 (High $$$ GPPs): 0  Top 10’s (Low $ GPPs): 0  Weekly Results: Highest owned guy, again was Paul Casey at 70%.

155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
26	26	35	36	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He hasn’t been in the best form, but has played TPC Boston seven times and only once missed the cut, and is simply too good to be offered at this price. Fade: We give you Bubba Watson. Some places fit him, and some don’t.
293	293	77	78	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			As the 146th Open gets underway this week in England, 156 hopefuls will compete for the right to be called Champion Golfer of the Year, and another chapter in the compelling and unpredictable history of this oldest major in golf will be written. Henrik Stenson aims to become the first player to successfully defend The Open title since Padraig Harrington did it in 2007 and 2008, and is joined by a marquee class of major champions including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott. Over the past decade, The Open has favored crafty veterans over young upstarts, with eight of the last 10 Open winners checking in at ages 33 or older.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
235	235	20	21	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His past history in this event is tempting, but there are too many other healthy horses to saddle this week. Jim Furyk – His record in this event sounds like he’s an automatic, but his current form screams the opposite. Big ballpark, and recent struggles makes Oakmont feel like it was a very long time ago in his native Western Pennsylvania.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
380	380	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
61	61	22	22	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
164	164	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
393	393	28	28	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
308	308	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts and hasn’t played since the Travelers. There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood – $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan.
359	359	13	14	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wait until he puts at least a couple good rounds under his belt. Jimmy Walker – $7,600  It’s very unfortunate to watch, but the decline of Jimmy Walker is tough to watch. He has now missed four straight cuts, and last week’s Sony Open might be the most eye opening.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
110	110	30	30	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
381	381	14	14	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed the cut the last to years at this place. Aside from Kapalua, Thomas has been playing well. But this course doesn’t seem to fit him and it’s tough not to be weary of a streaky guy on a track that hasn’t suited him.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.

332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
84	84	37	38	target: Padraig Harrington’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
123	123	5	5	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Might dabble in Bubba and/or Furyk if the price is right but I think Charl and Knox are fades for me. TUESDAY UPDATE: Was expecting a much higher salary for Furyk. I think at $7,200 on DraftKings, it’s easy to take a risk of relative poor form.
158	158	1	1	target: Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kevin Na ($8400): Na has a pretty sparkling course history here, with a T4 last year, T8 in 2012, and T9 in 2011 being his most recent successes (he missed the cut in 2014). Unfortunately, Na is not the same player he’s been in the past, and it’s shown this season with three straight missed cuts and only two top-10s in cut events. Na is struggling in some stats that show their importance this week, ranking a dismal 144th in GIR% and 65th in Birdie or Better percentage, but those stats have been inflated from playing the fall swing season events in weak fields on weak courses.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
21	21	15	15	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I don't care what stats or data you show me, I'm never paying $8,700 for McGirt when Justin Thomas is $8,600. Take my money.
456	456	8	9	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
227	227	21	21	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A brilliant and unlucky runner-up at Augusta, the Englishman is 4th on the All-Around in 2017 and 16th for GIR. Henrik Stenson  It’s well documented that Stenson is best played in the final two majors of the season. Evidence?
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
393	393	27	28	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His odds of making the cut are quite high and his T10 upside makes his price tag rather intriguing. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
392	392	3	3	target: Tony 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should. It’s not a bad price, but the likely ownership, less than stellar form and lack of success at Riviera leads us to fade him completely.
141	141	1	1	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Scott Brown – $9,800  Scott Brown is drawing a lot of attention from the DFS golf world this week, being tagged the 4th most on FanShareSports.com. Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events.
40	40	1	1	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Gary Woodland – $7,800  I guess I will never understand the Gary Woodland love. At $7,800, I’d expect at least solid recent form or course history, but Woodland has neither. Woodland is a sporadic golfer who can sometimes put together a solid round of golf or two and sneak inside the top 20.
116	116	19	19	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
228	228	11	12	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			One To Swerve  Of the elite, I’m not really convinced that Henrik Stenson is playing well enough and his record in this event is modest. I’ll reveal my full line-up in Tuesday’s Playing The Tips feature. Does he have the calmness needed for this event?
440	440	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
378	378	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
302	302	25	26	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There are too many other options in at the top of this board to consider Day if you are only building a handful of lineups. Tommy Fleetwood – $9,800  I was all in on Tommy Fleetwood at the U.S. Open and became huge fan. He was a joy to watch and has the approach game to put him with the World’s best.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.

From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
306	306	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Jason Day – $10,000  Something is very wrong with Jason Day this year and I am not willing to risk the chance he might find it this week at Royal Birkdale. Day has been awful off the tee this year, ranking 97th in driving accuracy.
137	137	25	25	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown comes in ranked 179th in SG: Tee to Green, 179th in GIR% at 63.45%, and 153rd in Par 4 Scoring. I will pass on Brown and load up on List in that price range. Podcast
142	142	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
190	190	18	18	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
394	394	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Stewart Cink $6,700 – This is another week where we aren’t crazy about the $6K range on DraftKings. There are a few other than Cink that we don’t mind like, McGirt, O’Hair, Barber, and Armour. But of all the options available, Cink seems to be the best bet to make the cut.
516	516	1	1	target: Lunde 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
292	292	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
356	356	6	7	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.
225	225	1	15	target: Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sorry, Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott will get his wish and Hogan will spin again, as he did when Scott won the Masters with the long putter, when caddies started reading greens via a map and when players started failing to show up for Friday tee-times after shooting Thursday 77s. Wood: I definitely think it is an easier setup in terms of fairway width and lack of penal rough around the greens.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
300	300	20	21	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri. Wont see high ownership but there are much better pivots on the board.
116	116	19	19	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
310	310	12	13	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’ll be lower than 5% owned easily in GPP’s. Player to avoid:  Dustin Johnson $12,200 – Dustin Johnson is our fade due to price, value, and recent form to an extent. DJ’s losing strokes on the field in his last 3 events and at $800 more than Kuchar…it’s the percentage play to us.
329	329	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			While the Scot has succeeded on all surfaces, it was a regression toward form that yielded just the singular top 10 in 2017. Kevin Na … It hasn't been a bad season, but it's been his worst while healthy in nine years. It also hasn't been any one thing, so there's a direct relationship between his stats and his production.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
407	407	48	49	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Free View in iTunes  6 Explicit Wells Fargo 2018 / PGA Tour The Tour Junkies break down the site of the Wells Fargo 2018 in Quail Hollow from North Carolina including their key stats, favorite plays, fades and sleepers.

285	285	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sweden's Henrik Stenson prepares to putt on the 5th hole on day three of the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links, Troon, Scotland, Saturday July 15, 2017. (Mark Runnacles/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)  IRVINE, Scotland (AP) — Henrik Stenson is pessimistic about his chances of successfully defending the British Open title at Royal Birkdale next week. The Swedish golfer shot his best round of the week at the Scottish Open on Sunday — a 4-under 68 for a score of 4 under overall — but it still wasn't enough to raise his hopes of lifting the claret jug again.
24	24	35	36	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He hasn’t been in the best form, but has played TPC Boston seven times and only once missed the cut, and is simply too good to be offered at this price. Fade: We give you Bubba Watson. Some places fit him, and some don’t.
278	278	10	11	target: Thomas Pieters 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Not sure I could think of a worse course for Thomas Pieters than PGA National.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
747	747	10	10	target: Rose/Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chasing another achievable double this week with Frittelli (45/1) into Rose/Stenson (7/1). Those prices won't last
391	391	30	30	target: Tony 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Given the very minimum price tag, the tee to green ability, the close calls this season and the scoring upside, he’s in play for GPPs this week. Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should.
180	180	19	20	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He'll make his debut in this event with ranks of 19th in BP and 49th in DD. Fade - Anirban Lahiri (59K): Lahiri ranks ninth in BP, which is the best rank in the field, but he ranks outside the top 100 in DD and SGA. He'll also be making his tournament debut, following up a 44th-placed finish at the RBC Heritage.
199	199	7	8	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Patrick Reed – $9,700  Patrick Reed has been on the struggle bus all season long. His last top 15 finish was at the CareerBuilder in January and has yet to finish inside the top 20 since.
215	215	9	10	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like this sneaky GPP play. Player to avoid  Brooks Koepka $10,200 – This pains us because we have such a man crush on Brooks. We’ve also been on him heavily since the end of March where he was finding form again.
178	178	3	3	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fade - Zach Johnson (77K): Like Taylor, Johnson doesn't match the course at all. The key difference: Johnson costs triple the salary. He is the fourth-most expensive player in this tier and has failed to crack the top 20 in each of his past two attempts.
269	269	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Very few signs of life lately and tough to forget the opening-round 79 at the U.S. Open last month. Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
296	296	10	10	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			So far this season has been a painful disappointment for Rory however, as he’s battled injury and generally been searching for his best form. The good news is after two consecutive missed cuts there’s nowhere to go but up for McIlroy. The bad news is there’s nothing to suggest the frustration surrounding his game will disappear this week just because it’s a major.
101	101	17	18	target: Patrick Reed. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Reed has been T-13 or better in three of his four Pebble Beach starts. Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed. A little concerned about Mickelson teeing it up for a fourth straight week, but he’s had more success here than anyone in the field.
430	430	39	39	target: Justin 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He is also a veteran on Tour who can win and score well almost any week and on any course so we’ll use that knowledge to our advantage to gain an edge picking the bargain plays. Player to Avoid:  Justin Rose $9,700 – DISCLAIMER! We know Justin is a world-class player and week in and week out should not be a fade.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
217	217	41	42	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven’t guessed the name yet, I’m talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
113	113	4	4	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two. Click To Enlarge!
143	143	3	3	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor. If you are going to tell me Brown is likely going to be highly owned at $9,800 when there are numerous options priced above and below him that are in better form, I will gladly fade Brown.
312	312	1	1	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Jim Furyk – $9,100  This does not seem like Jim Furyk’s tournament to win, or even contend in. With all the bomber talk and Par 5 scoring requirements needed to compete, it’s shocking to see Furyk’s impressive course history. With that said, the Furyk we are seeing this year isn’t like years past.
118	118	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Brooks Koepka – $7,700  What in the world is going on with Brooks Koepka. He has played terrible in his last two events and has reverted to snapping drivers in half to help solve his problems.
425	425	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The win still eludes him but his high-class consistency is appealing to fantasy managers. Tyrrell Hatton  Hatton was in the middle of a golden spell last year when a T10 here was the Mexican filling sandwiched between Florida T4s at the Honda and Bay Hill. He missed the cut at PGA National last week but prior to that was third in Abu Dhabi (3rd GIR) and let’s remember that he’s the World No.
333	333	18	18	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse. Looking at my sheet, there are only two other golfers in the $7,500+ range who have scored less DraftKings points per tournament(41) than Rahm.
346	346	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Player to Avoid:  Rickie Fowler $10,500 – Fowler is the one guy out of the top four on DraftKings we just can’t roster. You can make great cases for the other three up top (all previous winners here), but Fowler’s inability to close in strong fields like this is concerning. We mentioned that you have to roster the winner this week.
397	397	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Couple that with a dozen straight made cuts, and he’s in play this weekend. Fade: Some people may be willing to jump back onto Patrick Reed ($9,100), but I’ll pass after he lost strokes everywhere in Pebble Beach a few weeks ago. Value Golfers ($8,000 – $7,000)  Chesson Hadley ($7,700) is number one in my model this week, which factors in relevant Par 3, Par 4, and Par 5 distances in addition to Proximity and DraftKings Scoring.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.
192	192	86	87	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The other surprise name here is Nick Taylor, which tells us as much as we need to know about the strength of this event. Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.
316	316	22	23	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
112	112	33	33	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
352	352	8	10	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?
316	316	22	23	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
341	341	21	22	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Have a good feeling about a guy who is long off the tee and can make birdies in bunches. DraftKings bargain: Stewart Cink ($7,000). T-17 or better in two of three CIMB starts, and barely missed out on making it to East Lake last season.
198	198	3	4	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row. Charley loves Texas, but I really think that blow-up at Augusta will be on his mind for some time – at 40-years-old, he really isn’t going to get many more chances to win a major.
392	392	4	4	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Player to Avoid:  Tony Finau $8,200 – We love Tony, but in fantasy sports, you have to go with your gut more than your heart. Finau is a DFS favorite and always soaks up more ownership than he should. It’s not a bad price, but the likely ownership, less than stellar form and lack of success at Riviera leads us to fade him completely.
35	35	16	17	target: Patrick Reed. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He knows the course from his Georgia Tech days like the back of his hand. Fade: Patrick Reed. He’s finished 19th and 27th the past two seasons, and didn’t break par a year ago.
197	197	142	143	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
128	128	17	18	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, we still have a relatively strong field this week. The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms.
321	321	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, he’s a total cash game lock at that price. Player to avoid:  Branden Grace $8,200 – Grace is a low ball hitter that won’t have the carry distance needed to contend at Quail Hollow. Plus, conditions look to be softer with the rain so the course could get really long for the South African.
129	129	7	8	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field is highlighted by defending champion Jason Day. Jason Day WD from the WGC Mexico Championship due to flu-like symptoms. Jason Day has had a rocky start to 2017 with one top 10 at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and a missed cut.
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.

344	344	21	21	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
807	807	3	3	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Anyone else feeling Grillo this week? I think this might be the big boys man party ive been predicting hes gonna crash very soon #ThePlayers
164	164	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Matt Kuchar – $11,500  Who saw Matt Kuchar make a hole-in-one last week? Everyone?
108	108	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
273	273	15	15	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			1 has been a shadow of his 2016 self in 2017. It’s completely understandable, but Day recently missed the cut at the U.S. Open and the Travelers Championship and has yet to show that he can putt nearly as well as he did last season. • • •  Gerry Ahern  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
472	472	13	14	target: J.B. Holmes: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			When I’m on the fence, I jump off and wait for another day. J.B. Holmes: Nothing to point at in the form department but gamers love former champs. Four years ago I’m not sure he had the same wife or life.
294	294	26	27	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Firing long into the green is disastrous and will leave players with a cold-blooded, downhill, side-sloping putt. Players To Watch  It wasn’t that long ago when Rory McIlroy just rolled out of bed and woke up awesome. After McIlroy won the FedEx Cup last year, expectations for 2017 were justifiably sky-high.
326	326	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Anti-Specialists  The specialists above are positive in all five angles, but which golfers are the opposite and show a poor course fit? Anirban Lahiri  Keegan Bradley  Lahiri seems to struggle with tough courses and long courses while Bradley sees a big dip on bermuda. I don’t think either are must fade, but neither are popping off the page, either.
140	140	7	8	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players I will have no shares of. Scott Brown – $9,800  Scott Brown is drawing a lot of attention from the DFS golf world this week, being tagged the 4th most on FanShareSports.com. Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes.
1397	1397	4	6	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			🚨 Fantasy Alert 🚨 Charles Howell III has withdrawn from the @WMPhoenixOpen. Get your #FantasyGolf picks in at… https://t.co/Z78TkxzOC5
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
348	348	2	3	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
152	152	39	39	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Maybe that’s because he’s in his comfort zone so he can miss a putt every now and again and it doesn’t define whether he wins or loses, so because he can, he probably misses less of them. Harrington on Jordan Spieth:  Jordan clearly has the X-factor. He plays golf pretty much like everybody else but he has that something special and he brings it to Augusta.
117	117	3	3	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic. These unknown greens in Mexico will result in tough 5 – 7 footers and patience will help.
351	351	15	16	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s been consistently good since missing the cut at the PGA Championship in August. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Turning it around a bit to start the new season, but he struggled enough toward the end of last year that we can’t justify the $9,800 price tag here.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
356	356	6	6	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll be taking my money elsewhere. Bubba Watson – $8,000  If you are someone who enjoys to roster Bubba, and is seriously considering it this week – good for you, you daredevil. I don’t trust Bubba for a second, even if he does have a white ball back in play.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
222	222	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			-- Michael Collins  Adam Scott  It's been 10 years since Scott last played in Memphis, and the memory is not good as he blew the 54-hole lead with a final-round 75 -- and hasn't been back. But Scott is committed to playing the week ahead of majors this year and seems close to putting it together. -- Bob Harig  DraftKings value picks  Kevin Tway  Shooting 77-75 last week should be enough to get most of his backers to back off this week, especially with some more popular names around him this week.
157	157	23	23	target: Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Kevin Na ($8400): Na has a pretty sparkling course history here, with a T4 last year, T8 in 2012, and T9 in 2011 being his most recent successes (he missed the cut in 2014). Unfortunately, Na is not the same player he’s been in the past, and it’s shown this season with three straight missed cuts and only two top-10s in cut events.
81	81	13	14	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Negative : Si-Woo Kim ($6.4m) looks like 2016 has gone to his head. Luke Donald ($6.5m) doesn't do first appearances of the calendar year very well and Charlie Beljan at $6.7 million. Ask yourself 1) Why is he in the field?
30	30	5	6	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			As much as I liked Ryan Moore this week and last week, he's notoriously bad following a win. Not a single good showing.
203	203	37	37	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Fade of the Week is thus chosen for expected value vs. expected ownership, NOT because they’re necessarily good or bad plays. Dustin Johnson ($13000): This is one of the bolder fades to make this season, because DJ fits every aspect needed to succeed here – without rattling off his stats, he’s long, he scores, and he knows how to win. The reason to fade him here is purely based on his salary, and NOT the fact that he missed the Masters with a back injury, because that will just help drive his ownership down and scare people off to the point where DJ will be available at disgustingly low ownership.
346	346	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Player to Avoid:  Rickie Fowler $10,500 – Fowler is the one guy out of the top four on DraftKings we just can’t roster. You can make great cases for the other three up top (all previous winners here), but Fowler’s inability to close in strong fields like this is concerning. We mentioned that you have to roster the winner this week.
412	412	51	52	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Free View in iTunes  60 Clean The Traveler's Championship 2017 The Tour Junkies recap the Brooks Koepka victory at the US Open, the horrible Fox Coverage, and more.

122	122	24	24	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Early in the week, these guys are on my FADE LIST, but that may change when salaries come out. Might dabble in Bubba and/or Furyk if the price is right but I think Charl and Knox are fades for me. TUESDAY UPDATE: Was expecting a much higher salary for Furyk.
206	206	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We love him in GPPs! Player to avoid  Patrick Reed $9,800 – You’ve got to fade someone in this top tier on DraftKings, and Reed is the logical choice simply due to form. He did flash a little at the Zurich this past week, but he hasn’t had a top 25 since Pebble Beach in February.
295	295	10	10	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Players To Watch  It wasn’t that long ago when Rory McIlroy just rolled out of bed and woke up awesome. After McIlroy won the FedEx Cup last year, expectations for 2017 were justifiably sky-high. So far this season has been a painful disappointment for Rory however, as he’s battled injury and generally been searching for his best form.
204	204	40	41	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The tournament has suffered a bit in recent years as it’s place on the schedule falls shortly after the Masters and right before the Players. This year it has managed to attract the best player in the world however in Dustin Johnson, but the pickings are kind of slim field-wise after DJ. We’ll get a look at Adam Scott, who is only making his fifth start in 2017, but will only have seven players in the field total who fall within the top 30 in the OWGR.
85	85	15	15	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			“The Price is Wrong, Bob!”  The pricing on these golfers just doesn’t make sense. Padraig Harrington – $8,500  This one should be obvious to anyone who plays DFS Golf, but I have to mention the outrageous price on Padraig Harrington. He is priced ahead of Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson and Brendan Steele, all of which are far better plays than Harrington.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
231	231	24	24	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He may be a nice low owned stud in GPPs, and could be a solid cut maker for only $6,500. Player to avoid:  Martin Kaymer $7,000 – Kaymer is a big name, 2014 US Open winner, and a crazy price at first glance on DraftKings. However, we will be avoiding him for two reasons.
210	210	1	1	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Jason Day ($10000): Although it’s very appealing to get Jason Day as a “sneaky” play with his price coming as only the fifth-highest, back-to-back champions don’t happen at the PLAYERS. Day has yet to show that he’s regained his world number one form, coming T22 at Augusta and his best finish coming back at Pebble Beach with a T5. His putting stroke isn’t at the same level as last year, and although Day is typically a slow starter, by this time last season he’d already won twice (Arnold Palmer, Dell Match Play) and was entering off a T5 at the Zurich rather than a missed cut like this year.
216	216	6	7	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lock him up! Player to avoid  Bud Cauley $9,500 – Bud Cauley is a good golfer and we are sure he’s a nice guy and all, but we just can’t see playing him this week at his price with so many better options above and below him. Coming off four straight top-10 finishes probably does justify the price, but we just aren’t buying it this week.
243	243	59	60	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His Adam Scott-esque putting is the only reason he hasn’t won everything he plays, and that will definitely impact him in a negative way yet again – but on a course where a lot of the field won’t be pouring birdies or getting to the greens, he’ll typically have a chance to two-putt for par at worst. The Fade  David Lingmerth ($8500) – One of the few in this field with course history, the Swede won here back in 2012 when it was a Web.com event, and will garner some ownership just based around that. Unfortunately, where his game is currently is nowhere close to what’s needed to succeed again, beyond his lights-out putting.
459	459	29	29	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Here are five competitors in this week’s Masters who are generally considered green jacket contenders, but I’ll be avoiding. All odds are via 5dimes as of Tuesday afternoon  Jon Rahm (+2235)  That’s right: I’m kicking this thing into high gear right off the bat by recommending a fade of the world’s third-ranked golfer. Since his victory in Palm Springs three months ago, Rahm has failed to post another top-10 finish in five starts, including an early exit at the WGC-Match Play in his most recent start.
107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
388	388	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			But, if you’re chasing that big GPP takedown…have some exposure. Player to Avoid:  Branden Grace $9,100 – Grace is a world class player that thrives on tough courses where scoring is a premium. Pebble does not fit that description.

153	153	2	2	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Jason Dufner, $7,100  Dufner did book a 24th in 2012 and a 20th in 2013. But his last three trips to the Masters have resulted in MC, 49th, MC.
172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
142	142	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Brown is known for his course history, as he is a previous winner here and has multiple top 5 finishes. But this year, Brown is coming in with terrible form, missing his last two cuts and finishing outside of the top 50 nine of his last 11 events. I don’t see Brown regaining his form this week, especially if the winds play a factor.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture.
