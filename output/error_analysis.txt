3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
3633	3633	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price suckered me in. Paul Casey 40% – Speaking of way too cheap. Here we have Paul Casey.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
293	293	77	78	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			As the 146th Open gets underway this week in England, 156 hopefuls will compete for the right to be called Champion Golfer of the Year, and another chapter in the compelling and unpredictable history of this oldest major in golf will be written. Henrik Stenson aims to become the first player to successfully defend The Open title since Padraig Harrington did it in 2007 and 2008, and is joined by a marquee class of major champions including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott. Over the past decade, The Open has favored crafty veterans over young upstarts, with eight of the last 10 Open winners checking in at ages 33 or older.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
380	380	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
61	61	22	22	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
2122	2122	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
456	456	8	9	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
228	228	11	12	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			One To Swerve  Of the elite, I’m not really convinced that Henrik Stenson is playing well enough and his record in this event is modest. I’ll reveal my full line-up in Tuesday’s Playing The Tips feature. Does he have the calmness needed for this event?

440	440	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
378	378	12	13	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			If so, he may very well contend to win the tournament. Fade: Justin Thomas. While the reigning PGA Tour Player of the Year draws on the raucous crowd here, it hasn’t led to results.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
190	190	18	18	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
292	292	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
1423	1423	19	19	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take one of the best putters in the world at +2300 here. Not many guys are talking about Dufner this week. I’m plugging him into the majority of my Draft Kings teams as well as buying him at +5000 to win the Sony.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
101	101	17	18	target: Patrick Reed. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Reed has been T-13 or better in three of his four Pebble Beach starts. Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed. A little concerned about Mickelson teeing it up for a fourth straight week, but he’s had more success here than anyone in the field.
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
217	217	41	42	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven’t guessed the name yet, I’m talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.

3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B.

10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.

Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.

Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.

Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.

327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.

Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.

[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.

The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.

Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season.

That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.

Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.

THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).

172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1561	1561	5	5	target: Bae 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Taken a chance on Sangmoon Bae at 169/1 and 13/2 for the top 20 in the #GenesisOpen. Bae loves Riviera and has fini… https://t.co/lpLOmpQz73
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
278	278	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
