12044	12044	63	63	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a high risk/high reward GPP play as we should expect the return from injury to suppress ownership but we really do not know what to expect in terms of play. If Hideki is fully recovered than a $9700 price tag is simply absurd for a player with his talent and who should be under owned being priced next to Tiger  Francesco Molinari – DK Value – DK: $7300 FD: $9900  In his last four starts at this event Molinari has three top tens and no finish worse than T17. Although has not necessarily excelled this year a T25 finish at the WGC – Mexico Championship was a step in the right direction for Molinari.
7625	7625	24	24	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively. They’re historically pricey while DJ is around his average; that should affect ownership, and indeed DJ is projected for the most ownership this week at 26-30 percent in our Models.

12781	12781	11	12	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Charl Schwartzel: 30th Houston/47th Bay Hill/24th Doral/14th PGA National/8th Abu Dhabi. Phil Mickelson: 35th Houston/30th Bay Hill/14th Doral/24th TPC Scottsdale. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their wave and winning score since 2010.
3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.

11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
7813	7813	16	17	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is too talented to remain in this form forever. Other Options: Rory McIlroy    Mid-Tier Plays    Daniel Berger (DK: $8,300, FD: $6,900)  This is the site of Berger’s infamous one shot, then withdraw last year. It absolutely burned me last year, but I’m going to go back to the well.

5310	5310	16	16	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8 of his last 12 rounds here have been in the 60s and as we know Billy loves hard golf courses and is very par-70 positive. Horschel always looks forward to his visit to TPC Southwind, a course he truly loves as his comments in this 2015 interview highlight, "I think it's underappreciated. I think this is an underrated golf course.
1228	1228	4	5	target: Julian Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			when you see that Julian Suri is playing on the PGA Tour this week https://t.co/BNcuAvFSao
2543	2543	3	3	target: Willett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The case for Willett extends beyond his fair form and relative class compared to those around him in the market as the fundamental reason for siding with him is that I’m convinced he’s going to love this golf course. Look at where Willett tends to contend, and there’s a common theme: definition from the tee. Tree-lined golf courses are without doubt those he prefers, from Augusta to Fanling and stopping at various places – Milano, Saujana, Kuala Lumpur, Wentworth, Crans – inbetween.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
2073	2073	10	11	target: Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into the picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama ($11,500/$11,400) – Look, I understand Jordan Spieth played out of his dome last week, and I have no doubt he could ship this week too. But to put DJ and Hideki at $1,100 and $1,200 below him this week is simply blasphemous.
2232	2232	10	10	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I'm willing to bank on that happening. Zach Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($6,600)  Sometimes, it's easiest to just not overthink things when it comes to how DraftKings prices golfers each week. I wrote about Hadwin last week and he produced value yet again.
3858	3858	14	15	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like him in cash or GPP formats on DraftKings this week. Value Plays  Matthew Fitzpatrick $8,300 – FitzMagic is in wonderful form having not missed a cut since January. He’s a total ball striker with accuracy off the tee being his specialty.
9936	9936	3	3	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Off the course Palmer has been having massive problems with both his Wife’s and his own health but his tweet after his T58 in Hawaii suggests the stresses are getting easier. In a tweet this past Sunday, Palmer wrote “Happiest T58 I’ve ever had. After last two years, blessed to be back out with Jen getting healthy and myself being healthy.
2268	2268	29	29	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005. Scott is hitting just under 75% of greens in regulation and is one of the biggest hitters on tour. With a great record here and decent current form the Aussie could be one to watch here.
13214	13214	12	12	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below are the golfers who fit it this week. Casey  Kuchar  Harman  Cook  Glover  Landry  The top three aren’t a surprise, but the bottom three may test the trend! Cook, Glover, and especially Landry, don’t have the sharpest form coming into this week.
4151	4151	35	35	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior. While he struggles with the flatstick, Grace is an adept approach player, placing 13th on Tour in strokes gained: approach last year. Middling  Ian Poulter: $7,900  Poults has never needed it more.
1758	1758	47	48	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However you need to hit greens here period - a category where Phil currently sits 166th. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Justin Thomas ($11.5m); 2: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m): 3: Ryan Moore ($8.6m); 4: Hideki Matsuyama ($11.7m); 5: Chez Reavie ($6.8m); 6: Jon Rahm ($9.7m); 7: Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); 8: Brian Harman ($7.7m); 9: Jim Herman ($6.6m); 10: Sean O'Hair ($6.9m). Positives : Ryan Moore is a must select this week at a relatively low $8.6 million.
11669	11669	14	14	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This also included a change of coach. The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day.
122	122	12	12	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson, Spieth, Mickelson, Walker and Koepka have all safely qualified. Holmes, Watson, Kuchar, Fowler and Furyk amongst those down to 22nd in the current standings (see above) still have a shot at qualifying automatically this week. From there Davis Love III announces 3 of his 4 Captain's Picks after the BMW Championship (3rd of 4 events), with his final selection being announced after the Tour Championship.
10406	10406	12	13	target: Justin Thomas; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus.

TPC Summerlin: Patrick Cantlay; EW Places: Whee Kim, Cejka, Hadley, Kizzire, Hossler, Hoge Bradley, DeChambeau.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
2102	2102	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
67	67	26	26	target: Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
4564	4564	21	21	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He did gain strokes on the field putting last week at the Wells Fargo, so that is definitely a good sign. Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday.
5487	5487	3	4	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
5084	5084	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose , Kevin Chappell & Ryan Moore – Keeping things pretty chalky in the B-List, with a troika of former champs and a player on the ascent. Kuch has made nine cuts in a row at The Memorial, highlighted by a win in 2013, six Top 10s, and no finish worse than T26. If the course was designed by Pete Dye or Jack Nicklaus, you always play Kuchar… Hideki missed the cut last season following a win and a T5 in his first two appearances.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
5464	5464	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  See above. You have to drop down to Kevin Chappell at $8,800 for a player approaching what Mickelson brings to the table. He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints.
4654	4654	0	1	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Dufner ($8,800): Dufner ruined several lineups for people last week with his weekend plunge. However, Dufner has a knack for this course as he is 6/6 for making cuts year in the last 6 years with 3 top 10 finishes. He also checks the box for us ranking 46th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 26th in BoB%.
10205	10205	13	14	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, it may be enough to keep other owners away. -- Zach Turcotte  Tiger Woods  It is difficult to target a golfer making his first competitive start with FedEx Cup points on the line since this event last year, but in this case, the golfer is Tiger Woods. There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event.
984	984	10	10	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - Sentry TOC - 3pts win Spieth @ 6-1; 1.5ew Rahm 12-1, Matsuyama 12-1; 1ew Perez 33-1; 0.5ew Bryan 200-1
2028	2028	11	11	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
9935	9935	24	24	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer has also only missed the cut twice in that span, so he generally sticks around for the whole week here. Off the course Palmer has been having massive problems with both his Wife’s and his own health but his tweet after his T58 in Hawaii suggests the stresses are getting easier. In a tweet this past Sunday, Palmer wrote “Happiest T58 I’ve ever had.
363	363	18	18	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Quick thoughts on @ValsparChamp: Everyone is going to be all over Haas. Could be a good time for Hadwin. Luke Donald - not so sneaky play
7173	7173	30	31	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course was last played in 2008 when Padraig Harrington took home the Claret Jug. In that year a few current players finished high up on the leaderboard; Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey all finished within the top 10. All three of these players share a few traits within their games; they are all accurate off of the tee and great tee-to-green.
9279	9279	26	26	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
5603	5603	47	48	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The cost per session was $125, albeit free for me, and worth every penny for those who glided four rounds with the most mechanically gifted swinger of the golf club maybe ever. I don't know when it hit me Sunday, but at some point I realized, damn, Dustin Johnson is kind of built to win U.S. Opens.
935	935	7	7	target: Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Brown, SW Kim &amp; Rodgers in RSM Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
7704	7704	21	22	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
78	78	16	16	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Retief Goosen $7.1 million - just ask yourself again. I personally have big doubts about Rickie Fowler at $9.5 million as well. Naturally he could explode into tournament wining form at any point, but Fowler 2017-style to date has been a pale impersonation of 2016-style where he had already finished 5th at Kapalua and won in Abu Dhabi.
5644	5644	22	22	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of the past seven winners, all of them ranked inside the top twenty for the week in GIR percentage. Stud Picks  Jason Day ($10,800): Day has actually lost strokes to the field on his approach shots over six of his last eight rounds, but has still managed to pull off 15th and 2nd place finishes in his last two starts. To make a long story short, Day is killing it on and around the greens right now, something he did with regularity last year, but is lacking with his iron play.
231	231	13	14	target: J Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five for Pebble Beach: C Smith 125/1, S Cink 150/1, M Thompson 175/1, J Hahn 200/1, G Owen 200/1. 365 have nice top20 prices for latter four
3661	3661	29	29	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One week after that debut at Augusta he was invited here, and he finished T23 when still an amateur. Despite missing the cut this time last year, I feel Fitzpatrick has an excellent chance to make that splash on the PGA Tour that many are expecting. His putting is a strength of his, just like his fellow countrymen, Luke Donald who has a brilliant track record here at Harbour Town.
7872	7872	33	34	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only reason I'm leaving him on the bench to begin with is because I have one start remaining. EXPERT BEN EVERILL , Staff Writer LINEUP | BENCH Jason Day  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Adam Scott  Dustin Johnson  Rory McIlroy  PROJECTED CHAMPION Adam Scott Former champion needs a kick for his season to be up to standard. Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can.
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
5899	5899	7	7	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But it was at Muirfield Village where Watson really came to the fore for me this week. Rounds of 71-68-68 placed him in 3rd spot going into the final round and despite a 73 on Sunday, Watson held on for a morale-boosting season's best 6th place finish. 10th for Greens in Regulation, 13th for Putting Average, an eye-opening 11th for Strokes Gained Putting and joint tournament best -8 across the par-4s were keys to a strong result against the likes of Fowler, Thomas, Kisner and Spieth.
3081	3081	24	25	target: Thorbjorn Olesen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Player Odds DK Price Comparables Martin Flores 90-1 $6,800 Andres Romero $6,900 and 125-1  Hunter Mahan $6,800 and 125-1  D.A. Points $6,900 and 150-1 Thorbjorn Olesen 60-1 $7,700 Willy Wilcox $7,900 and 80-1  Sam Saunders $7,800 and 100-1  Andrew Johnston $7,900 and 80-1  HORSES FOR COURSES  Scott Brown is a former winner of this event who in five starts at this event has only finished outside of the top 10 once. He finished 5th here last season but comes in on the back of some bad form as he had a terrible missed cut at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week.
7176	7176	30	30	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
8978	8978	2	3	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Stewart Cink at 125/1 Paddy Power The competition is less fierce than a normal PGA Tour event and his ball-striking should out him in contention. He might excel in the early part of the season away from the spotlight.
3919	3919	20	20	target: Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now tweets alone are not enough to go by, but I do believe him. With a baby on the way, Peterson needs to start cashing cheques and realising his potential, something a lot of players tend to do when facing parenthood for the first time. There are other indicators that this can be a good sport for Peterson also.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
3972	3972	1	1	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ryan Moore and Adam Hadwin were others who caught my eye. Moore had an excellent Masters until falling away on Sunday to finish T9. He also posted T8 at this venue on his only start in 2012.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
1252	1252	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes (7.4k) - not accurate off the tee yet has 33/6/2/23 L4 here. (DA was under 45% each time). Wish his for… https://t.co/MjIQAYaJcI
10742	10742	11	11	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His past five years here shook out in finishes of 5/11/4/64/6. Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure.
484	484	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on. Jason Day ($9,300): Speaking of putting, the Aussie is in a class of his own with it comes to putting this year. Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end.
13257	13257	15	15	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you have gamer's remorse, well, there you go. Just as he was last year, Donald is my pick. If you don't like it, ask yourself if you're stereotyping for whatever motivation.
6585	6585	30	30	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price remains the same heading into this week and people are jumping ship after back-to-back missed cuts. With only 10 tags on FanShareSports (two of them being sit calls), Walker is flying under the radar in a field of subpar strength. Walker lost three strokes on the field last week around the green and his putter could not pick up the slack.
12865	12865	1	1	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But Scott’s ability to get to the green is slowly returning to an elite level, and that’s what we should all care about this week. Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott.
1380	1380	1	1	target: @ScottPiercyPGA 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @ScottPiercyPGA at 74/1 in the #WasteManagementOpen. Piercy showed some very positive signs in the desert at… https://t.co/GkIfeyNt42
11204	11204	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has done well at PGA National, with top-15s in three of the past four years. Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago.
4057	4057	8	9	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.
12672	12672	29	29	target: Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
7360	7360	12	12	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's the same game plan I had last time we were here." Stenson didn't have his best stuff at the Scottish Open last week but he closed with a 68 for T26 and his best Open results have come when he's warmed up on the links in Scotland. He may also have noted that Padraig Harrington came to Royal Birkdale as the defending champion in 2008 and retained the Claret Jug.
9272	9272	24	25	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks is a top-four scorer even in this stacked field, and his ownership should be around average across the board. Embed from Getty Images  Rickie Fowler $9,600 – Does everyone remember #SB2K17? How could you not?
6224	6224	41	41	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A good putting week and he'll be very dangerous on a course like this. I don't want to be backing anyone at short prices this week given the lack of course form so therefore I'm happy to take the 50/1 about Bradley rather than the short odds for Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. Bill Haas and Brendan Steele have good credentials but between them they have a win apiece since 2013 so I'm not overly enthused about either at 25/1.
310	310	3	4	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
2296	2296	14	14	target: Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Of course all that matters is that Harrington got it done when it counted. Berger, who was born and educated in Florida would have been hoping for a successful return in 2016 however he failed to make the cut, with opening rounds of 73-72. Leading into the event last year, Berger’s recent results read MC-58-MC-42, so it was perhaps not a surprise he missed the cut.
8933	8933	3	3	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray  16. Scott Hend  17. Adam Hadwin  18.
11166	11166	10	10	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Noren is also 40th in scrambling. Tier 2 Values    Gary Woodland - $9,700 (25-1)  Woodland is the rare player who hits it far off the tee yet is accurate. He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation.
4097	4097	30	31	target: Daniel Summerhays 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lower Tier  Luke List ($7600) (Finished 29th here last year)  JJ Spaun ($7800)  Anirban Lahiri ($7300)  Sung Kang ($7400)  Nick Watney ($7500)  Martin Laird ($7700)  GPP wild cards with upside  Daniel Summerhays ($7000)  Freddie Jacobson ($6500)  Shawn Stefani ($6100)  Kevin Tway ($6000) I like him for his course history and the fact he ranks 4th in Bogey Avoidance for a course that could potentially see the winner in single digits under par. (Patrick Reed $9700 and Zach Johnson $9300 have worse odds to win it all than Billy does).
12386	12386	35	35	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's the ultimate wild card because you're likely going to burn him at some point, but you still wouldn't miss him if you didn't. Meanwhile, because he's still building a database of logical sites, Jon Rahm also wears the badge as a sensible starter for you in Austin. In the same vein as the advice not to dismiss notables who failed to survive pool play, you still need to ignore Rahm's runner-up finish as a first-timer last year since past success doesn't dictate future proficiency in this format.
10418	10418	29	30	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His tee-to-green proficiency has already yielded a trio of top 10s this season, and with a taut short game (31st in scrambling), he's 21st on TOUR in adjusted scoring. Robert Garrigus … Profiles as the kind of bomber that makes sense on occasion at TPC Scottsdale, just as long as his putter is cooperating. The 14th club has been both his bane and boon over the years.
12142	12142	33	34	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With little wind forecast for day one scoring is bound to be low , making a confident touch on Bermuda greens imperative." *EW Terms: 1/4 Odds | 5 Places  Steve Rawlings says: Back Bubba Watson @ 40/1  Bubba Watson is a mercurial character and there isn't a venue played that doesn't highlight his unpredictability better than Bay Hill. It was in this event in 2014 that he withdrew after shooting an 11-over-par 83 in the opening round, which included an 11 at the par five sixth hole!
3814	3814	21	22	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Weekley is 60th on Tour in GIR and T35 in proximity, so he does have the right game for Harbour Town. Zac Blair - $6,500 (Field, 5-2)    If all PGA Tour courses were short, Blair would be having a much better career. He's made 11-of-15 cuts this season and is coming off his best showing, a T8 at Houston.
11679	11679	8	8	target: Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Geddit? First selection has to row along with Bozzelli especially after that 13th last time in a good class field at PGA National. His 10th in the St.Jude last year gives further evidence to his ability in these conditions and all that after being very comfortable in front when winning his maiden web.com event.
335	335	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very minimal research but on top of DJ and Spieth I really like JT this week. Vegas And Haas for cheap. Woody Phil and Reed too.
2345	2345	39	40	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Ian Poulter, Willy Wilcox  Players to Consider for DraftKings (in no order)  – Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Russell Knox, Daniel Berger, Danny Willett, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Daniel Summerhays, Seung-Yul Noh  – Graeme McDowell, Ollie Schienderjans, Matthew Fitzpatrick, David Lingmerth, Sean O’Hair, Ian Poulter, Francesco Molinari, Willy Wilcox He’s made three of four cuts here and has an 8th place finish from 2014. Lingmerth’s only win on tour also came on a Jack Nicklaus designed course at the Memorial so there’s a nice tie in there as well.
4674	4674	2	3	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			GPP ONLY. Nick Taylor $6,900  Welp, there ya go. The top 17 (no idea how I keep landing on that number of picks every week) for this week if playing on DraftKings.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
12797	12797	61	61	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money. A winner of the Farmers Insurance Open in January, a course that has seen Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson triumph in the past, Day captured his 11th PGA Tour title and first for 20 months. From there 2nd at Pebble Beach and a competitive 22nd at Bay Hill after a month's inactivity highlight a player who's playing some decent stuff under the radar.
10007	10007	8	9	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson at 28/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6)  1pt e.w. Aaron Wise at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  0.5pt e.w. Beau Hossler at 250/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  0.5pt e.w.
2454	2454	44	45	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Branden Grace withdrawing after the first round definitely beat up a number of otherwise promising cash lines as well. Poor Sunday performances by Kisner (77), CH3 (74), and RCB (74) further dinged our cash hopes, but fortunately a huge performance by the constantly underrated Gary Woodland along with solid showings by Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Brendan Steele, and a few of our hedge plays buoyed a number of subscribers to a positive ROI, including myself. I’d also like to extend a special congratulations for Scott P. on a pretty sizable GPP hit this week as well – nice work buddy!
6487	6487	70	70	target: Reed. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson has not played the event since 2013 and failed to make the cut in all three goes but needs to get going again somewhere following a short break and we know he likes to play himself into form with competitive rounds as the Open Championship gets closer. He starts as 22/1 chance but I would rather break the mould for once and take some 16/1 about market leader Patrick Reed. Rather like Watson, Reed’s game can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other with some brilliant attacking golf at the US Open immediately followed by error-strewn clumsiness.
5361	5361	11	11	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year. Brooks Koepka, $10100 – Finishing second, third, and 19th in three Memphis starts is a good track record for anyone, let alone the fourth-highest ranked player in the field. Koepka is plenty long and posted five top-16 finishes over his last seven starts.
544	544	33	34	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 18th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee, 1st in Strokes Gained Approach, 7th in Proximity, 15th and 10th in Par 4 & 5 Scoring and 9th in Birdie or Better %. Patrick Reed  Vegas Odds - 16/1  Draftkings - $9,700  FantasyAces - $5,700  While he isn't quite the amazing value he was at the Barclays when he started the playoffs at $8,800 on DraftKings, he is still a terrific value under $10K this week. He sits first in the standings after his win to open the playoffs and backed that up with a T5 last week at the Deutsche Bank Championship.

11441	11441	30	31	target: Joost Luiten, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Beyond the names we’ve watched for two months now, there’s a slew of players setting down in North America for the first time in 2018. Euros Ross Fisher, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Joost Luiten, Jorge Campillo and Paul Dunne are in the field. As is Australasian Tour money leader Brett Rumford, along with countrymen Wade Ormsby and Adam Bland.
682	682	6	6	target: Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			as you know, I'm a big Gribble guy. and he's from TEXAS. more later on this. https://t.co/keg5WaDjOx
3210	3210	0	1	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar ($9,000) – A lack of length can be detrimental to some, but it’s virtually never a problem for Kuch. Kuchar has played here sparingly, but outside of one poor finish in 2015, he’s managed two T8 finishes and a runner-up since 2010. He’s the epitome of course management and has been rock solid steady for the vast majority of this year.
2290	2290	11	11	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the wonky pricing, entire cash game lineups are becoming chalk. Rose will be in it on Sunday. Jim Furyk – $6,700  Jim Furyk gave all those who rostered him a heavy dose of pars last week, managing to only score 30 DraftKings points in three rounds before getting MDF’d.
10346	10346	25	25	target: Streelman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times. Obviously, he wasn't stating an exact number, the idea remains the same as Streelman, he will be very comfortable sleeping in his own bed this week. Has a pair of top 20s in two of his five starts here, so he's still a bit boom-or-bust.
11557	11557	54	54	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			European Tour's Race to Dubai returns this week on Page 3. Golf Channel (PlayFantasyGolf.com)      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”    Last Week Points: 223  Last Week Rank: 8,402      Dustin Johnson ($33,300)  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Abraham Ancer ($1,100)  Dean Burmester ($2,300)  Patrick Cantlay ($14,400)  Phil Mickelson ($14,600)    Analysis: Going with a Stars and Scrubs approach this week with DJ and Spieth leading the way. Ancer should be comfortable with the culture and language spoke on the property this week.
2178	2178	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world. Day doesn’t have the strongest history here (two MCs and a 64th), but the last time he played this event was way back in 2012 and given the layoff I wouldn’t put too much stock in his shaky course history. While he hasn’t shown dominant form yet in 2017, Day put in three great rounds at Pebble and this could easily be the week he puts the hammer down and distances himself from the field.
1379	1379	5	6	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Couldn't leave out @WMPhoenixOpen specialist Hideki Matsuyama at 10/1. The Japanese absolutely loves this course ha… https://t.co/0demzJaYtY
6703	6703	6	6	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy early and often! VALUE  Nick Taylor ($7,600) – Feeling generous, are we DK? Taylor has been red hot lately, and the only reason he isn’t priced even higher than this is because his putter tends to let him down from time to time.
4634	4634	178	178	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
7817	7817	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He hasn’t had a signature win since The Players a few years ago, and I think this could be spot where he breaks through on the WGC stage. Jason Day (DK: $9,400, FD: $8,800)  This is purely a gut call and could blow up in my face, but I’ll be going heavy on Day in GPPs. I have to believe that his ownership will be microscopic and in an 76-man field, we’ll need to take some shots on low owned guys who can legitimately win the event.
6153	6153	28	29	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			14 in the Power Rankings), Harris English (Sleeper) and Chez Reavie (Draw in the Fantasy Insider). That you've come this far without a mention of two-time Travelers champion Bubba Watson says all that you need to know. Because of an inconsistent 2017 perhaps due to the change in his ball, he sets up as an ironic contrarian at the tournament where he's the all-time earnings leader, but only if you're way back in the pack.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
10967	10967	17	17	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still, he missed the cut. Coming into Riviera off a missed cut and in questionable form makes Scott a decent GPP play this week. Since we know most golfers will be playing from the rough this week, I peeked at guys who make birdies from the rough.
12784	12784	29	30	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think this week signifies his best chance of winning a Major and, if he doesn't, a top-8 finish is by no means out of the question. Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course.

3028	3028	24	25	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
8381	8381	9	9	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are my picks for 2017 Northern Trust. Jason Day 20/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds) 2 pts e/w:  Jason Day looks to have found some consistency again and when that happens it is time to stand up and take notice. Day is still win-less so far this season, however he has twice gone close finishing 2nd at the AT&T Byron Nelson and T5 at Pebble Beach earlier in the year.
965	965	20	20	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Hero Chall Picks D Johnson 7s 3pts Win B Koepka 12s 2.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4 [as advised y/day] K Kisner 33s 1.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4
1433	1433	7	7	target: Kelly 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How on earth was course specialist Jerry Kelly matched at [300.0] on the exchange? Winner in 2002, Kelly has made the top-20 on 11 of 17 renewals this century, including top-nines in the last three. He's since come down to around [200.0] but still looks massively overpriced.
11670	11670	7	7	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day. In the shorter term though I feel a big week could be in the offing for him at the Valspar.
2802	2802	1	2	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
8408	8408	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I love him this week. MID TIER  Matt Kuchar ($8,700) – No matter where he is, no matter what the course demands, Matt Kuchar finds a way. It’s truly incredible.
1688	1688	20	20	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
11774	11774	11	11	target: Wise, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That leaves plenty of room for boom-or-bust options at the bottom. Wise, Hossler, and Burns are all youngsters with top-10 potential while Woods is just too cheap still. Editor’s Note : With over 15,000 reviews, DRAFT is the highest rated fantasy sports app.
3633	3633	5	6	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price suckered me in. Paul Casey 40% – Speaking of way too cheap. Here we have Paul Casey.
12862	12862	30	31	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose rates out near the top of every single stat, has nine top 10s in his past 11 starts, and has gone P2/T10/T2/T14 the last four years at Augusta National. Adam Scott  The 2013 Masters champ took most of the first two months off from competitive play, and since his return at Pebble Beach, the results have been rather middling — MC/T53/T13/T16/T41. Guess why?
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
11429	11429	32	32	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played in this tournament last year, and if it weren’t for an opening round 76, his T55 finish would look much, much better. What is different from last year, is that Noren was not playing nearly as much as he has been in 2018, making his results from last year tough to compare. I’m all in and Noren is a lock for cash.
1674	1674	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016. For a player who hits it as long as Woodland, his ranking of 59th in scrambling is very underrated.
8505	8505	49	49	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To recover from a 77 with a closing 70 to finish T9 was a fair effort and that top 10 built on previous finishes of T24 (WGC-Bridgestone) and T27 (Open Championship) so he's clearly coming back to life after a dip. Talking at Quail Hollow after a second-round 66, Day explained: "There were signs coming from Royal Birkdale; there were signs coming from last week in Akron. Being able to piece it together is difficult, because the driving and the putting has been lagging behind.
10637	10637	15	16	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He let us down last week with just a top-40, but the price remains low. Jimmy Walker ($8,500 | 110) - Walker is nothing more than a dice roll at his price. He's 125th in the field in strokes gained: tee to green over the past 12 and is still working his way back after being diagnosed with Lyme disease.
2757	2757	24	24	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row. Not only can Haas dominate the Par 3’s, he is also top 20 in SG: Tee to Green.
11763	11763	47	48	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top 5 Finishes So Far This Season  1st – Aaron Wise – $8,800 – Byron Nelson – Week 20  1st – Jason Day – $9,400 – Farmers Insurance – Week 4  1st – Bubba Watson – $8,200 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  2nd – Patrick Reed – $7,700 – Valspar Championship – Week 10  2nd – Chez Reavie – $8,000 – AT&T – Week 6  2nd – Adrian Otaugui – $7,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Lucas Herbert – $7,100 – Rocco Forte Open – Week 19  3rd – Brandon Steele – $7,800 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  3rd – Alex Noren – $8,700 – WGC Dell Match Play – Week 12  3rd – Jorge Campillo – $8,700 – China Open – Week 17  3rd – Emiliano Grillo – $8,600 – Fort Worth Invitational – Week 21  4th – Seungsu Han – $7500 – Oman Open – Week 7  5th – Chris Paisley – $7,400 – Dubai Desert Classic – Week 4  5th – Phil Mickelson – $8,700 – Waste Management Open – Week 5  5th – Seungsu Han – $8,500 – Corales Puntacana Championship – Week 12  5th – Webb Simpson – $9,400 – RBC Heritage – Week 15  5th – Jorge Campillo – $8,500 – Espana De Open – Week 15  5th – Phil Mickelson – $9,200 – Wells Fargo – Week 18  Euro Tour Picks sponsored by Golf Predictor – for all your DFS stats for both the European & US PGA Tours.

204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
168	168	6	6	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
8610	8610	70	71	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This section is going to detail a few of the golfers who have the best fantasy value compared to their odds of winning this week. Player Odds DK Price Comparables Marc Leishman 66-1 $6,900 Tony Finau 7,100 and 80-1  Russell Knox $7,100 and 125-1  Emiliano Grillo $6,900 and 175-1 Adam Scott 34-1 $7,900 Gary Woodland $8,000 and 100-1  Webb Simpson $8,200 and 55-1  Charley Hoffman $8,300 and 50-1  Course Horses  Phil Mickelson loves being aggressive, and this course has suited him well in the past. Phil won this event after the changes were made in 2007 and also has a 10th and fourth in his past six visits.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
5639	5639	0	1	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott ($8,800): Scott has been up and down ever since the Masters but his recent finish at the FedEx St. Jude suggests a man whose long game might be finally peaking. Scott was top five in SG: approaches and tee to green in Memphis and has actually been putting better than his career averages recently too. For DFS, he’s well under priced at just $8,800 and probably a better play from a pure value perspective than anyone in the 9k range.
6235	6235	6	6	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10200 – The world’s ninth-ranked player heads the field and represents a good value after a week of rest following his recent top-5 finish at the U.S. Open. Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form.
217	217	3	3	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Reed, Knox &amp; Simpson in Phoenix this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
12041	12041	60	61	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Strategy Tips for this week (based on 60k standard salary cap)    Well-rounded players who are solid off the tee with great irons excel at Bay Hill, but there’s also a chance a few elite putters find themselves in contention as well. As such, focus your efforts on securing great ball strikers who have shown flashes of good putting recently (*cough* Jason Day - Justin Rose - Tiger Woods *cough*) and blend in others who have proven history at the King’s place. The eventual winner is going to need to drive it well and score on the par-5s to have any chance, so make sure you fill your lineup with players who have a good chance of doing just that.
8142	8142	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another guy to watch on Fanshare, but I can’t see him above 25% with all the names above him. Rickie Fowler $10,700 – He has a win at Quail in 2012 and a 4th in 2016. I think he figured something out last week after a bit of a letdown at The Open.
7302	7302	34	34	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman combines recent form and key stats that I am looking at in my players this week. Ownership of a player does not always mean you must fade them and I will be playing Harman this week. Anirban Lahiri – Fade  Losing strokes approaching the green, around the green and through driving accuracy are all leaving me off of Lahiri.
12221	12221	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
2036	2036	20	21	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the weather is truly as bad as it looks, I also like Brandt to contend more than others. Tom:  Justin Rose $9,200 – Rosey has teed it up twice in the States in 2017, and twice finished in the top 5. When players of his caliber do this, it is best to just ride the hot hand.
12439	12439	49	50	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MATT’S CINDERELLAS  Dylan Frittelli ($6,900), 41 seed, Group 7  His familiarity with the course/area and potential road to the quarterfinals make him interesting to me. Group 10 doesn’t scare me at all which means you could get at least 5 rounds out of him before his inevitable loss to Justin Thomas. Group 7 is ripe for the picking, and I think whoever makes it out moves on at least one more round.
12032	12032	41	42	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Though Arnold isn’t physically present, his legend lives on in what should be another fantastic close to the Florida Swing. Recent Past Champions    2017 – Marc Leishman  2016 – Jason Day  2015 – Matt Every  2014 – Matt Every  2013 – Tiger Woods  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Martin Laird  2010 – Ernie Els  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Tiger Woods    Key Stats to Winning this Week    • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green  • Strokes Gained Putting  • Par-5 Scoring    Champion’s Profile    As a longer track with some penalizing rough, it’s a must for players to drive the ball well, both long and straight. The length becomes a nice advantage on the reachable par-5 holes and longer par-4s that prove demanding over four rounds.
858	858	19	19	target: Hoffmann 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All about guessing when he gets hot, and he was solo second through 54 holes here last year. Morgan Hoffmann ($6,400). Certainly don’t like his recent play coming in, but with Hoffmann being extremely hit or miss, he’s prone to really good finishes after poor stretches.
93	93	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sleeper of the Week  Our weekly pick for you is one that you may not expect. Graham DeLaet: He scored a top 5 here in 2012 and was 20th in the Olympics a few weeks ago. He also posted a top 10 in July, so he is close.
4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
1288	1288	13	13	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open picks: Winner: TIGER! Just kidding... Leishman Top 10: Finau, Howell, Steele DK Sleepers: L… https://t.co/JMY4XPGdcM
7240	7240	10	11	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance. Even if you doubt his ability to win, there's an awful lot of each-way juice in that price with eight each-way places.
2184	2184	25	25	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott will likely be my one-and-done pick this week as he has gone T-2, T-10 and T-17 in last three tries at Riviera. If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk.
11901	11901	26	27	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			282 yards (48th), 60.7% fairways (51st), 72.2% greens in regulation (7th), 33'8" proximity to hole (11th), 60.0 % scrambling (34th), 1.65 putts per GIR (3rd). 2013, Tiger Woods (-13). 279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st).
12059	12059	26	26	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season. Of his eight PGA events, Grillo has two top-10s, including at a very tough Honda Classic in which he finished T8. Grillo performs well on tough courses, can play in the wind and is a very strong second-shot golfer.
8384	8384	2	2	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			More recently Day contended at the US PGA Championship and had it have not been for a third round 77, he may well have won his second major title, and the US PGA Championship for the second time in three years. Day shot an 8 on the par-4 18th in round three and that derailed his chances of winning massively. Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama.
11066	11066	11	12	target: Harris English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No doubt that still leaves him an appetite for revenge here. Harris English is your Driver-off-the-Deck BOLD play of the week! #isitThursdayyet  Joel Harrington  @joel4deepgolf
6104	6104	65	66	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For tournaments, I will be looking to build around a core the same core for the most part but also using some contrarian plays that could be lower owned with similar upside. The Course  TPC River Highlands - Cromwell, CT  Par 70 - 6,841 Yards  Greens - Bentgrass  **Click to Enlarge**  Past Five Winners  2016 - Russell Knox (-14)  - Russell Knox (-14) 2015 - Bubba Watson (-16)  - Bubba Watson (-16) 2014 - Kevin Streelman (-15)  - Kevin Streelman (-15) 2013 - Ken Duke (-12)  - Ken Duke (-12) 2012 - Marc Leishman (-14)  The Stats & Fantasy Approach  My Key Stats:  Strokes Gained: Off the Tee + Approach  Par 4 Scoring Average  Greens in Regulation from 100-150 Yards  Birdie or Better %  Other Stats I am looking at - Bogey Avoidance, Strokes Gained Putting  I will also be factoring in players who do well on Par 70 courses and Pete Dye designed courses. This information can be found be visiting the Future of Fantasy's Golfanac.
826	826	12	12	target: GAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
1081	1081	13	13	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Chapman - Sony Open - 2ew Kisner 25-1; 1ew S W Kim 60-1, Henley 40-1, Swafford 90-1; 0.5ew J Walker 100-1, Leishman 16-1
222	222	5	5	target: Streb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
727	727	3	4	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson. In three years, he has two top 10s here at Sheshan Golf Club, including a win in 2014.
10399	10399	78	78	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has always been a player who, once confident, can perform at a high level for a prolonged period of time. Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best.
4911	4911	55	56	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Colonial CC is often affectionately referred to as 'Hogan's Alley' after the five-time winner Ben. Weather Forecast      TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Jordan Spieth -17  2015 - Chris Kirk -12  2014 - Adam Scott -9 (Playoff)  2013 - Boo Weekley -14  2012 - Zach Johnson -12      What Will it Take to Win the Dean & Deluca Invitational? Colonial is short by modern standards and Driving Distance is an irrelevant stat, with irons being taken on many tees.
1249	1249	65	66	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
792	792	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Jimmy Walker -- The PGA champion has a strong TPC Summerlin record, with three top-15 finishes in the last five years. There's a reason MGM sponsors the guy; he shows up in Vegas.
10096	10096	38	39	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He sits in the top quarter on Tour in all the key stats for the week (strokes gained: approach, Par 5 scoring, birdie or better %), and is now using these events to get ready for The Masters. Austin Cook ($8,700) – The early frontrunner for rookie of the year, Austin Cook has more than that on his mind. Cook has come out on fire to start his PGA Tour career.
2851	2851	1	2	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Bill Haas - Haas was outclassed in Mexico, but he's otherwise been great this season. This is a good track for him, and he should have won here last year.
9004	9004	11	12	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Purse: $7 million; $1.26 million (winner); 500 FEC points. Defending Champion: Justin Thomas defended his championship as he defeated Hideki Matsuyama by three shots. Notes: 78 players; 72 holes (no cut).
8090	8090	19	20	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My shortlist was massive this week although very few really struck me as potential winners. Of those that did, Bubba Watson and Charl Schwartzel were the most notable within our price range. Both have majors pedigree, excellent Florida records and are long off the tee.
2192	2192	33	34	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
1209	1209	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he'll have hit the reset button since placing 10th in Tiger's tournament and he's definitely worth following in this event. Hopefully, this is the best market for us to fully cash in and it's worth pointing out that with four payout places, Reed could finish eighth in the tournament and we'd still edge a profit on him. With the front of the betting so strong, it's hard to find much space for any bigger-priced players.
10576	10576	19	20	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Simpson has also started the season strong and has four top 10s here, including a runner-up a year ago. Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
6044	6044	26	27	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, instead of targeting year-long stats, I’m focusing on rolling stats from the past five weeks. Looking at this data, the field leaders in SG:APP are Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey, Daniel Berger, Mark Hubbard, Marc Leishman, Byeong-Hun An, David Lingmerth, and Scott Piercy. Strokes Gained Putting (SG:P): I don’t typically target putting stats, but I think putting will be huge this week because everyone in the field should be hitting fairways and greens.
4096	4096	36	37	target: Shawn Stefani 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lower Tier  Luke List ($7600) (Finished 29th here last year)  JJ Spaun ($7800)  Anirban Lahiri ($7300)  Sung Kang ($7400)  Nick Watney ($7500)  Martin Laird ($7700)  GPP wild cards with upside  Daniel Summerhays ($7000)  Freddie Jacobson ($6500)  Shawn Stefani ($6100)  Kevin Tway ($6000) I like him for his course history and the fact he ranks 4th in Bogey Avoidance for a course that could potentially see the winner in single digits under par. (Patrick Reed $9700 and Zach Johnson $9300 have worse odds to win it all than Billy does).
4100	4100	6	7	target: Kevin Chappell. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tied for seventh at the Masters. Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
9716	9716	1	1	target: Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas, $19,400    Despite a surprisingly poor finish last week for Thomas, the insatiable talent is primed for a bounceback, especially coming off a momentous 6-under 67 in the final round last week. Thomas for a second-straight week will serve as defending champion, but don’t let last week’s performance scare you away. Given the similarly dry conditions compared to last year, Thomas will feel comfortable attacking this venue in a redemption week.
1863	1863	27	27	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In those four starts he has two missed cuts, but when he has made the weekend has looked fairly good. At the Shriners Hopsitals for Children Open, Jones shot four sub-70 rounds, including an opening-round 65 to finish T15. Despite missing his next cut, two weeks later at the RSM Classic, Jones has since bounced back.
8466	8466	40	41	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And once more, he's right on the bubble when it comes to qualifying for a team event - this time the Presidents Cup, in which he was disappointing two years ago and will doubtless therefore be keen to make amends. Patrick Reed  You know as well as I do that he'll be selected as a wild card regardless, but that was also the case a year ago yet the Texan wanted to take care of business for himself. There's absolutely no doubt that his sensational performance at Hazeltine, capped by that Sunday singles win over McIlroy, can be traced back to the way he hauled himself over the line at Bethpage.
4280	4280	30	30	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
8010	8010	27	27	target: Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That first round was a tough one for him in his debut in the Wells Fargo, but he played well throughout the rest of the week. Like Holmes, Finau has played pretty well of late. He was fifth in the RBC Canadian Open and seventh in the Greenbrier Classic.
816	816	19	20	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick to Click: DJ was awful last week; I’ll do much better this week. Winners picked this year: 1  Brooks Koepka – $10,700 Out of alt he guys priced 10k and above, he’s the only one I’d play at a high clip. Chris Kirk is playing very well right now, but I think Koepka is going to win, and soon, and it might be in Vegas this week.
1251	1251	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What is going on with Charley Hoffman’s DraftKings salary this week? He’s the 9th top-ranked golfer in the field, t… https://t.co/2ETp8RsST8
7605	7605	30	30	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The left-hander has never managed a top 20 in an Open and had missed four of his previous eight cuts so it clearly was an event which troubled him. But Watson battled away to finish T27 and I think he can take the positives from that performance to Glen Abbey this week. He's still not found anywhere near the form which won him two Masters titles in three years but T6 at Memorial (a Jack Nicklaus design, as is Glen Abbey) was a reminder of his talents and he's made all three cuts in July and shot six of his last 12 rounds in the 60s.
12810	12810	14	15	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			AUGUSTA, Georgia — Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo is buying into the hype, saying Tiger Woods will “threaten” in his quest for a 15th major championship this week. Woods is on a mission to add to his 79 PGA TOUR victories and 14 majors, returning to Augusta National for the first time in a playing capacity since a T17 finish in 2015. Woods has already collected the green jacket four times, but not since 2005.
4976	4976	42	43	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Casey hasn’t been great at Colonial recently, with a missed cut and a 43rd-place finish in his last two trips, but he arrives here in top form: He is tied for fifth in the field with his 68.1 Recent Adj Rd Score. Jason Dufner: Dufner’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score ranks ninth, and his 14.5 LT Adj Bird Avg is seventh overall. Duf Daddy has two runner-up finishes at Colonial (2012 and 2014) and finished sixth last year.
1099	1099	9	9	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: B Gay 125/1, B Stuard 125/1, W Kim 250/1, C Campbell 250/1, M Hoffmann 250/1, C Conners 300/1
12219	12219	71	71	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This year he has been drawn in a group with his Ryder Cup buddy Jordan Spieth, Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel. As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through.
1185	1185	12	12	target: Pan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Palmer - CareerBuilder - 2.5ew Simpson 25-1; 1ew C-T Pan 200-1; 0.5pt ew McNealy 275-1 #CareerBuilderChallenge
7518	7518	24	25	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			what are you waiting for? This week you can sign up for our premium tools for free using coupon code WIN at dfsarmy.com*  Picks  Dustin Johnson – GPP – DK: $12600 FD: $10600  DJ showed the form was back at the Open Championship despite faltering a little on Sunday. With back to back runner up finishes at this event DJ has shown success at a course the suits his game perfectly.
578	578	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will. He’s long enough to suit this course and with 9 consecutive tournaments of being under par, Reed has the scoring ability to win everything come Sunday.
13575	13575	15	16	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His profile as a long hitter shadows the fact that he's actually the total package. Billy Horschel has a glowing track record in this tournament, but all of us might swerve if not for his T5 at the RBC Heritage. Conservative front-runners will still abstain because of his inconsistency, but the rest of us will latch onto his immediate success after returning to a putter of familiar length.
818	818	13	13	target: Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like that form to continue this week. o P/PR= 88  • Cody Gribble – $8.400 Fresh of his first PGA Tour victory, Gribble’s masterful Sunday propelled him to full tour status for the next 2 years. I’m sure that will have a great effect on him, and I expect to see him around a lot this year.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
4333	4333	1	1	target: Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Watney ... Not that there was ever a doubt, but he’s playing with a new lease on status, so to speak. For finishing among the throng at T5 (with partner Charley Hoffman) at TPC Louisiana, Watney met the terms of his Major Medical Extension by $3,091. He still had 10 starts to burn and wasn’t in danger of reduced playing time, but it was a nice way to celebrate his 36th birthday (April 25).
1031	1031	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
11902	11902	25	26	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			279 yards (49th), 53.6% fairways (71st), 63.9% greens in regulation (34th), 38'10" proximity to hole (46th), 61.5% scrambling (32nd), 1.63 putts per GIR (1st). 2012, Tiger Woods (-13). 295 yards (11th), 64.3% fairways (29th), 79.2% greens in regulation (1st), 36'4" proximity to hole (20th), 60.0% scrambling (10th), 1.84 putts per GIR (52nd).
11649	11649	39	39	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace lost strokes on his approaches in Mexico for the first time all season, yet he continued his season-long trend of saving pars from missed GIRs. If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament.
16	16	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
294	294	12	13	target: Blayne Barber, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obligatory bet on Russell Knox (obviously) and threw a few darts with Blayne Barber, Michael Thompson, and Fabian Gomez at long odds.
1142	1142	5	6	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka - $8,900  3. Rickie Fowler - $7,900  4. Russell Knox - $7,400  5.
1661	1661	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Jimmy Walker - Jimmy Walker has been somewhat quietly playing good golf since winning the PGA Championship. He shocked with a MC at the Sony Open; don't expect that here.
2937	2937	8	9	target: Rory McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico. This week, he will be the one standing with the trophy on Sunday evening.
853	853	16	17	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But he got majorly back on track last week contending at Sanderson Farms before finishing T-8. Graham DeLaet. He’s admitted he’s still recovering from an extremely difficult summer with his chipping – in which the dreaded word “yips” were brought up for his short-game struggles.
398	398	20	20	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s shown great success at TPC Boston and he’s going to be an elite option in all formats this weekend. Sergio Garcia ($9500)  So, I may have just mentioned Adam Scott as my top overall play, but Sergio isn’t far behind. In fact, why don’t we call it even?
7254	7254	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
5901	5901	47	48	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			11th here in 2014 featured rounds of 63-70-68-69 and Cauley was 2nd after firing that -7/63 and was 7th going into Sunday. I also like his love for Pete Dye designs (Dye re-designed this course back in 1982) which is something that runs across Knox/Streelman/Duke and even Bubba Watson (a winner at TPC Louisiana). Cauley was 3rd at the CareerBuilder Challenge back in January which features the Dye Stadium Course as the host venue plus he's also finished 9th at Harbour Town, 5th (in partnership with Justin Thomas) and 11th at TPC Louisiana.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
6792	6792	66	67	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
4628	4628	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson ($12,500) – Don’t try to be the smartest guy in the room by fading DJ here, because there’s about a 90+% chance that you won’t be. In his last six appearances here – and we know how much better he has gotten in that time – DJ’s worst finish is T20.
10332	10332	29	29	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Fade: Tiger Woods.
235	235	46	46	target: Berger. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was injured shortly after the win and was forced to withdraw from the Bridegestone Invitational which burnt a lot of people. I am hoping with a combination of that and the enormous amount of great plays in the $6K range lead to low ownership for Berger. He is coming off a T5 at teh Travelers that could have easily been another win had he not crapped the bed with a 74 on Sunday.
7703	7703	4	5	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
2764	2764	17	18	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I expect him to break out very soon and contend for his first Tour title. DraftKings bargain: Scott Brown ($6,700). I don’t think you’ll have to go too deep this week considering the strength of field, but if you want Justin Thomas or Henrik Stenson then Brown is a good option.
11595	11595	33	33	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			SHOW INDEX 0:04 General Nonsense with ANDERCUST 5:04 David Carr 10:19 Tim Curses the Raiders a...

1249	1249	6	7	target: Martin Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When my two favorite darts are Martin Flores and Nick Watney, it’s probably time to log out.
6579	6579	30	30	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The scrubs in these tournaments are trash, and the upside a top tiered golfer offers isn’t much higher than someone in the $9K range. That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls.
12168	12168	3	4	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The fervor that Tiger Woods manufactured at last week's Valspar Championship was all the most skeptical needed to close the chapter on any residual doubt in his latest return to competition. His performance aligned with candor, honesty, adjusted expectations and the glint of his old and still familiar fire. It reminded us of all that once was good and that he could be again.
11715	11715	14	15	target: Sam Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, instead, I'll jump down to the three-figure prices and try a punt on Sam Saunders at 125/1. Asked recently what his grandfather, the great Arnold Palmer, might say about his recent play, Saunders replied, "Something like, it's about time you won." He'd made a similar point himself at the start of the year.
12706	12706	33	34	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a shame we don't still visit Doral for the Cadillac as that's clearly flagged a few recent winners but form at the Genesis Open is worth more than a cursory glance. Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely.
1272	1272	4	4	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
12834	12834	1	1	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While JT gets the headline vote, I don't see any great need to make the case against the rest of those at the front of the betting. Each has their chance, and each is well worth considering, but truth be told only Spieth came close to selection alongside Thomas. Spieth's record here is outstanding - he's led at the conclusion of eight rounds from just 16 played - and he did what he needed to do at Houston last week.
10803	10803	10	11	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He clearly loves playing in this laid-back type of event. Patrick Cantlay ($10,400): The Cali native finished T9 here way back in 2013. He made his return last year with a T48.
4835	4835	16	17	target: Chris Kirk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Jordan Spieth: 18th TPC4S/MC Sawgrass/2nd Augusta/13th GC of Houston. Chris Kirk: 13th Sawgrass/69th Heritage/33rd Augusta/8th TPC San Antonio. Adam Scott: 38th Sawgrass/14th Augusta/3rd Bay Hill/25th Doral.
898	898	5	5	target: Ogilvy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Can’t believe the 250/1 on Ogilvy in Vegas is still standing. 200/1 Sabbatini very big also. Small dart at Hoge 200/1 too
70	70	43	44	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			But he’s back and of course he picks up a W along the way. Yearly Results:  Wins:1  Top 10’s 300/ top 5’s 1060/ top 3’s 5300 (High $$$ GPPs): 0  Top 10’s (Low $ GPPs): 0  Weekly Results: Highest owned guy, again was Paul Casey at 70%.

4706	4706	26	27	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A 2016 win at the Jones Cup Invitational played at Ocean Forest Golf Club on Sea Island, Georgia is also interesting. Players such as Justin Thomas, Patrick Reed, Jordan Spieth, Victor Dubuisson, Paul Dunne and Austin Connelly all feature in the winners list of this strong amateur event, with a couple of those featuring at Birkdale last July. 2015 saw the then amateur Hossler finish 58th at the U.S. Open hosted at Chambers Bay and since his promotion to the PGA Tour, Beau has shown serious signs by the coast.
2729	2729	105	106	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Kevin Streelman; 2) Ross Fisher; 3) Keegan Bradley; 4) Henrik Stenson; 5) Charles Howell III / Sergio Garcia; 7) Russell Knox / Justin Rose; 9) Jordan Spieth; 10) Gary Woodland; 11) Paul Casey; 12) Adam Hadwin / Adam Scott; 14) Tony Finau / Hudson Swafford; 16) Lucas Glover / Peter Uihlein; 18) Byeong-Hun An / Billy Horschel; 20) Branden Grace. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Matthew Fitzpatrick; 2) Peter Malnati; 3) Sergio Garcia; 4) Chesson Hadley / Webb Simpson / Tiger Woods; 7) Sam Saunders; 8) Zach Johnson; 9) Cameron Smith; 10) Matt Kuchar; 11) Ollie Schniederjans; 12) Jason Dufner / Charley Hoffman; 14) Dominic Bozzelli / Adam Hadwin / Louis Oosthuizen; 17) Justin Rose; 18) Austin Cook / Brian Gay; 20) Michael Kim. Winners & Prices : 2017: Hadwin 125/1 ; 2016: Schwartzel 33/1 ; 2015: Spieth 16/1 ; 2014: Senden 125/1 ; 2013: Streelman 200/1 ; 2012: Donald 11/1 ; 2011: Woodland 100/1 ; 2010: Furyk 30/1 ; Average: 80/1.
1032	1032	7	7	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
1985	1985	15	15	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I hurt way too much last week. Price isn't the only thing to like about Reed as he has excellent course history with finishes of T22, T4, T7 and T21 last season. He ranks inside the Top 1o of West Coast Positive players and although the stats don't show it thus far, he is an amazing scrambler.
801	801	6	6	target: CASEY, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WellsFargoChampionship win: DJ in mix: RAHM, CASEY, webb, BRYAN, berger 💣: poston, gay 5/1 is your only hope. 💰e… https://t.co/OzxPWUtlnc
6545	6545	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries. Cink is one of the best in the field in SG: Approach. He’ll be wildly popular we suspect in DraftKings GPPs, but it’s too great of a bargain to pass up.
726	726	8	8	target: An 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
11399	11399	5	5	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Ross Fisher, who finished alongside Rahm in third ranked second for GIR. If you did miss the small greens, recovering well was key also with Rahm and Fleetwood (tied third and second) ranking first and second for Scrambling. Is There an Angle In?
186	186	3	3	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SonyOpen Picks Luau Jimmy 22-1 Paul Casey 28-1 Russell Knox 40-1 Daniel 🍔 40-1 Scott Piercy 40-1 Chris Kirk 50-1 Harris English 60-1
4752	4752	26	26	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			His year started with a bang, grabbing a T3 at the Career Builder Challenge, and he has top-10 performances in his two most recent events. Still, Cauley has recently struggled with bogeys . .
5363	5363	21	21	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field. Adam Scott, $10300 – Returning to Memphis for the first time in 10 years -- he finished seventh in that edition -- Scott is hoping to tune up his game for Erin Hills and pick up a much needed win. Scott hasn’t triumphed since his back-to-back victories early last year.
5600	5600	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Maybe his trusty Trackman is the Little Dutch Boy plugging that leak, maybe not. Whatever the case, Dustin Johnson is the defending U.S. Open champion and has evolved into the best golfer on the planet over the last six months. The Official World Golf Rankings tell me that -- he leads No.
8931	8931	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That makes him a very nice rebound candidate this week. Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations.
320	320	21	22	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With great current form and a near winner last week Day could go one better and win in style this week. Patrick Reed 25/1  The young American really stepped up to the plate last week and got the job done in Bethpage with a great win. He has been knocking on the door a lot over the last few months with six top 15’s and a win in his last 10 events.
11352	11352	47	48	target: PATRICK CANTLAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watching Phil over recent weeks I feel like I’ve been watching a loop of a tape where his putts keep hanging on the edge or burning the edges and if he can just get one or two more to drop this could at last be his week. PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price.
5340	5340	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On to the Picks! Next Day Air  Brooks Koepka $11,500 – He finished second here last year, 3rd the year before and 19th in 2014. I watched him all last week on Shot Tracker and his biggest issue seemed to be making putts.
2472	2472	18	18	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be in for some positive regression this week. When looking at our European Tour comp courses, Garcia fits. He’s especially fond of Crans Sur Sierre, home of the Omega European Masters.
12025	12025	29	29	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
11399	11399	5	5	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Ross Fisher, who finished alongside Rahm in third ranked second for GIR. If you did miss the small greens, recovering well was key also with Rahm and Fleetwood (tied third and second) ranking first and second for Scrambling. Is There an Angle In?
11040	11040	13	13	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At his worst, he’s a grinder who can get you to the weekend. Keegan Bradley  If you have a pacemaker, please, for your own safety, do not roster Keegan. The stress will have you in the emergency room.
8582	8582	42	43	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are firm and you have a lot of options for shots around the greens." Weather Forecast    TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, starting at 19:00 on Thursday      Last Five Winners  2016 - Patrick Reed -9  2015 - Jason Day -19  2014 - Hunter Mahan -14  2013 - Adam Scott -11  2012 - Nick Watney -10      What Will it Take to Win the Northern Trust? It's never easy when a new venue is used but it sounds like the fairways are generous enough so Driving Accuracy is probably a stat to ignore.
6101	6101	8	9	target: Lucas Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At $6,500 why not play the hot hand? Lucas Glover – $6,600 and a strong cut maker. When he is in sync he pushes top 10/25 territory.
7501	7501	34	35	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
372	372	0	0	target: Berger/Kuchar/Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Berger/Kuchar/Kirk have me at first look. Berger is essentially an every start bet for me now, Somewhere along the… https://t.co/GepfpOJK8N
12647	12647	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the GOLF GODS exist, they’ll be worth a couple of shots this week. Brandt Snedeker: He’s never made the cut but his last trip was 2013. He was one shot out of the lead at Valspar before fading with 78.
1269	1269	21	21	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Top 5 Cash Plays (Emphasis on Safe Floor and Solid Avg. Projection) 1. Leishman 2. Fowler 3. Harman 4. Cink 5. Matsuyama
11	11	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
4127	4127	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week. He is surrounded by two guys with more than twice the amount of mentions then him, Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore, who will likely soak up a ton of ownership.
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
12058	12058	32	32	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I especially like him in cash games because his $7,500 price tag gives you a solid cut-maker with upside and saves some salary-cap space for other high-end options. -- Jeff Bergerson  Emiliano Grillo  Although Grillo faded down the stretch at the Hero Indian Open and is flying across the world to play this week, he still offers excellent value at his price tag. He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season.
1206	1206	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And he also showed it when winning this tournament two years ago. Reed posted 21-under on that occasion before showing his one-to-one skills by defeating compatriot Jimmy Walker in a play-off. There's a good chance he'll be top dog again this week but I actually prefer to play him in the special market where the top four in the betting are taken out.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
293	293	77	78	target: Rory McIlroy, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			As the 146th Open gets underway this week in England, 156 hopefuls will compete for the right to be called Champion Golfer of the Year, and another chapter in the compelling and unpredictable history of this oldest major in golf will be written. Henrik Stenson aims to become the first player to successfully defend The Open title since Padraig Harrington did it in 2007 and 2008, and is joined by a marquee class of major champions including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, and Adam Scott. Over the past decade, The Open has favored crafty veterans over young upstarts, with eight of the last 10 Open winners checking in at ages 33 or older.
1817	1817	13	13	target: Berger: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Buy him before Bubba Watson ($8,300) or Padraig Harrington ($8,500). Throwing Darts  Daniel Berger: $7,000  Berger didn't have his best stuff at Torrey Pines where he missed the cut, but it's not a course he plays well. He tied for 10th at the WMPO in 2015, so he's proved capable at the desert course.
3043	3043	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one. I have a slight concern with Kirk in that he’s never played here before, but raw talent should get him into contention this week. He’s a great putter and wedge player and should take advantage of the par-5s.
5927	5927	11	12	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has been overlooked lately and I think the trend continues. Bud Cauley ($7,400) – Bud has cooled off in his last 3 events and this is right when I want to get back on board. He is a scorer and this course does not present the dangers the last 3 events have played.
1428	1428	8	8	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ThePME @fantasynational I see a lot of Captain Kirk 😎
13228	13228	14	15	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had a decent week at Augusta and should do well here with his length. Luke Donald – It’s hard to look past Donald at Hilton Head, despite him never winning there. His record speaks for itself so he should contend.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
8518	8518	19	20	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman ranks 5th in Par 4 Scoring, 6th in SG: Putting, 13th in BoB% and 15th in SG: T2G. Tony Finau ($7,300): A ball strikers course with Tony Finau priced near the bottom of the field. SIGN ME UP!
253	253	1	2	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 Jason Day No. 1, Back-to-back Top Five Finishes  While he failed to add to his major total in 2016, Day has succeeded in establishing himself as the PGA Tour’s most consistent threat to win. He nearly chased down Jimmy Walker at the PGA Championship last month, ending up in a tie for seventh, and he followed that up with a solid tie for fourth at The Barclays last week.
13241	13241	2	2	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head. Moreover, his lack of driving accuracy (140th) and iffy iron game (60th in strokes gained: approach) forecast trouble.
3592	3592	28	28	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Berge is a solid player in every category, but does a great job on the green which should help him have a strong run at Augusta. Last year, Berger had a strong finish in 10th place and will be a high owned pick in cash and GPPs because of his play last week and overall strong play in the 2017 season. Francesco Molinari will be one of the better scorers of the tournament on par 5’s and has a shot to knock down some eagles.
13035	13035	32	32	target: Cabrera-Bello 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a lock for cash games this week and do not be surprised if he uses his momentum to make a run at a top-10 finish. -- Zach Turcotte  Rafael Cabrera Bello  Cabrera-Bello returns to Augusta for his third straight start at this event and FanDuel has a mouthwatering salary for him this week. The lower $7k range on FanDuel is typically reserved for golfers with slim chances at contending for the week and Cabrera-Bello is far from that.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
2351	2351	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott - Adam Scott is the overall favorite to win the Honda Classic, but you can still fetch him with odds of +1100. Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage.
7866	7866	25	25	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look no further then Jason Day. I think with Day’s price and relative performance this year he should realistically see smaller ownership as Rahm, Stenson, Kuchar and Garcia all eat up some of his exposure within the same price range. In Day’s latest appearance at The Open Championship he showed signs of his game returning with a T27 finish.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
521	521	19	19	target: Westwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FRO - Jeremy Chapman - Houston Open - 1.5pt ew Henley 40-1, Stenson 14-1; 1ew Mickelson 22-1, 0.5pt ew Westwood 100-1, K Bradley 70-1
11429	11429	32	32	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played in this tournament last year, and if it weren’t for an opening round 76, his T55 finish would look much, much better. What is different from last year, is that Noren was not playing nearly as much as he has been in 2018, making his results from last year tough to compare. I’m all in and Noren is a lock for cash.
245	245	11	11	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
12137	12137	48	49	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expectations have to be tempered until he shows the same sort of form in bigger events, so a Top-20 bet looks the more realistic option this week but this could well be a breakout year, should he put together a couple of good weeks early. Tom Jacobs – Jason Kokrak to be the First Round Leader 55/1  This is a simple one for me. Kokrak is off fairly early on Thursday (9:23am), sits 4th on Tour in Round One Scoring Average (68.18 in 11 rounds) and 13th in Early Round One Scoring Average (68.20) over the five rounds he has teed off early.
1624	1624	19	19	target: Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			3 adds just now over at sportsbook: Knox 50 Ollie 60 Kizzire 60 They join from yesterday: Tommy 30, Harman 35, Billy Ho 100
1175	1175	13	13	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He drained 27 birdies at this track last year and finished T8. Zach Johnson ($6,300): This is probably the first and last time you’ll see Johnson as the cheapest golfer in the field. Zach hasn’t finished better than 33rd in his last seven tournaments, but he could make his way into a lot of lineups this week for those looking to load up on the expensive studs.
2441	2441	21	22	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love his ballstriking. My DraftKings lineup for this week:  Justin Rose - $9,600 Jon Rahm - $9,000 Sergio Garcia - $8,500 Jason Dufner - $8,100 Rafa Cabrera-Bello - $7,400 Louis Oosthuizen - $7,200  To access this research hidden below and MANY more fantasy golf tools, sign up for GNN Plus to gain access to the analysis!

5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
1018	1018	2	3	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Sleeper: Luke List.
727	727	3	4	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson. In three years, he has two top 10s here at Sheshan Golf Club, including a win in 2014.
7688	7688	2	3	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
11875	11875	2	3	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
5377	5377	28	28	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s fired just one round in the 60’s since April, and the price is too high to risk for a guy who can’t seem to find a top-10. Scott has averaged 58% of his fairways this year, ranking back at 126th which will not suit this golf course. We’d much rather roll with the safer Molinari or pay up for Fowler.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
815	815	3	3	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5. Strokes Gained Approach to Green – Simpson, Garrigus, Cejka, Taylor, DeLeat  Player Focus: The Shriners  On the Rise: Pretty bad week overall.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
6289	6289	18	18	target: Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is sixth on Tour in greens in regulation and 47th in both SG: Tee-to-Green and approach. Matt Jones - $6,700 (80-1)    Jones is a curious guy. For a golfer costing $6,700, he has odds of only 80-1.
4610	4610	23	23	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m going to keep myself out of the narrative game for the foreseeable future because it rarely works out well. In the meantime, Garcia is entering this week as the defending champ and he also won back in 2004 back when there were two courses in the tournament rota. Tony Finau… Back on bentgrass on a course that doesn’t heavily restric driver usage.
5386	5386	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Brooks Koepka  The man has only played the event three times and he's gotten better each year. From T-19 to T-3 to runner-up in 2016.
1399	1399	19	21	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
12761	12761	47	48	target: Rory McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
4238	4238	60	60	target: Reed's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What's more, playing team golf certainly seemed to perk him up and it needed to, as he's fallen to 11th on the Presidents Cup points list and while likely to be named as a wildcard anyway, he won't want to leave things to chance. With all that I've said about the absence of real clues here, I would rather chance Reed's proven ability to get the job done over someone like Paul Casey, who is less than half the price but is nowhere near as ruthless. Posted at 1825 BST on 01/05/17.
10658	10658	35	36	target: Matt Kuchar; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Jordan Spieth; 2) Kevin Streelman; 3) Billy Horschel; 4) Dustin Johnson; 5) Chez Reavie; 6) Kevin Kisner / Shane Lowry / Pat Perez; 9) Patrick Cantlay / Scott Piercy; 11) Matt Kuchar; 12) Bryson DeChambeau / Russell Knox; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Corey Conners / Rory McIlroy; 18) Branden Grace; 19) Jason Kokrak / Andrew Putnam; 20) Austin Cook / Charley Hoffman / Sam Ryder / Gary Woodland. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Padraig Harrington; 3) Phil Mickelson; 4) Jon Rahm; 5) Matt Kuchar; 6) Kevin Kisner; 7) Chris Stroud; 8) Rafael Cabrera-Bello; 9) James Hahn / Maverick McNealy; 11) Gary Woodland; 12) Dominic Bozzelli / Whee Kim / Vaughn Taylor; 15) Brian Gay / Peter Malnati; 17) Branden Grace; 18) David Lingmerth; 19) Austin Cook / Retief Goosen / Cody Gribble / Ben Martin / Pat Perez. Winners & Prices : 2017: Spieth 9/1 ; 2016: Taylor 300/1 ; 2015: Snedeker 25/1 ; 2014: Walker 28/1 ; 2013: Snedeker 14/1 ; 2012: Mickelson 25/1 ; 2011: Points 80/1 ; 2010: Johnson 22/1 ; Average: 63/1.
303	303	10	10	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 2ew Thomas 18-1, Fowler 18-1; 1ew Kisner 40-1
13590	13590	22	22	target: Streelman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given his game has continued to improve and he still made the cut, Steele at $8900 is a very attractive price. Kevin Streelman, $7700 – Streelman has been well known to struggle on the putting green, but if the recent winners have shown, putting can be negligible on this track. His last 24 rounds have seen Streelman be 14th in SG: T2G, 15th in SG: OTT and 24th in Par 5 scoring.
2191	2191	18	18	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
1373	1373	6	6	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Winners for this week. Xander 100/1, Harkins 150/1 and Brazel 140/1. All ew.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
11197	11197	7	8	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is ranked 44th in driving accuracy. Stewart Cink - $6,800 (150-1)  Cink is in the odd position of going 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National but never securing a top-25 (he was T27 and T26 the past two years). So, if you are looking for a bargain-basement price with a really good chance to make the cut, Cink is your man.
13682	13682	24	24	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook , Thomas is listed at 16-to-1 odds, just behind tri-favorites Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day. Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
4957	4957	40	41	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways.

Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
11875	11875	2	2	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T54  Patton Kizzire 1pt EW 90/1 with New customers get £25 in free bets*** (7 places, 1/5 odds). 18+, T&Cs apply:  Patton Kizzire must feel very confident right now and I think he's overpriced this week. We know that Patton is Bermudagrass-positive and clearly he's having the season of his life right now.
302	302	15	15	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 2ew Thomas 18-1, Fowler 18-1; 1ew Kisner 40-1
1788	1788	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are a few names to consider at every different price level. High-Priced  Hideki Matsuyama ($11,700) – It’s not that I don’t like Spieth – it’s that I couldn’t justify putting anyone higher on this list than Matsuyama. He has been as hot as anyone in golf since last fall, consistently playing well enough to make cuts and at least getting into position to challenge for a top spot on the leaderboard week in and week out.
598	598	6	6	target: McGirt, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bets for this week: Knox, 50/1 McGirt, 66/1 Stanley, 80/1 Herman, 150/1 All outright only and to be followed by Top 20 bets.
5056	5056	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			UPPER TIER  Matt Kuchar ($9,400) – Steady Kuchar looked like a potential cut risk on Thursday/Friday last week, but in typical Kuchar fashion, he rallied back for a nice and easy T12 finish. There is nobody in this field with a better overall track record at this course, and when it comes to smooth, steady T2G play, Kuchar is among the best ever. Lock him in.
10523	10523	18	19	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I've been slow to jump on the train, but I can't ignore the form plus local knowledge angle. Austin Cook ($8,300): Going with my second rookie, Cook certainly doesn't play like a rookie. He's beat the field average by four or more strokes in five of his seven starts this season.
8724	8724	19	20	target: (Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens are smaller than average and sectioned into quadrants. Don't discount the fact that the last two winners here (Jason Day and Zach Johnson) are among the tour's best putters. In addition to the aforementioned dexterity with the flatstick, aptitude with the driver (distance preferred!)
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
5133	5133	9	9	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Team #rahmGOAT is back in action this weekend. Adam Scott ($9,800) – Love the way Scott has been playing lately. He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year.
8577	8577	7	8	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Why not make it back to back? Paul Casey – $9,000  Even though he doesn’t win, Paul Casey loves to get out of the gates hot and wind up inside the top 15 in some way. It sucks to see him get so close so many times, and you have to think is time is coming soon, but if he continues to churn out top fives regularly, that will do just fine for DK purposes.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
11017	11017	4	4	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Tom Hoge $6,600 – Hollywood Hoge is somewhat of a gut call down here in this range.
12887	12887	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance. While not all his stats are strong this year he does rank 1st in strokes gained: putting and 4th in par 4 scoring and I’m sure his whole 2018 campaign so far will have been geared to peaking this week.
1931	1931	18	18	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He looks like a player that could really suit this course and has to be respected here. Patrick Reed 33/1  Despite starting the season poorly, Reed has been showing some good signs over the last few weeks with some solid performances. He finished solo 10th at the Hero World Challenge and followed that with a T6 at the SBS Tournament of Champions, which included a second round 65.
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
6516	6516	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is still struggling a bit with his irons, but his scrambling is elite, and he’s making as many birdies as anyone on Tour. Reed has two top-30s at this course in three attempts, but he’s the firm favorite for me this week. Bill Haas ($10,800)  Haas is another player trending towards a win this summer.
7691	7691	9	9	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Get him while he’s feeling good. DraftKings bargain: Bill Haas, $6,900. His record at Firestone is OK, but Haas has been solid for months up until a missed cut at the Open.
11365	11365	37	37	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5 couldn’t get much going here last year when shooting 70-72-71-71 to finish T38 but expect a real improvement on that. Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
5512	5512	25	26	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1.
7705	7705	3	3	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
13285	13285	38	39	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Over five starts at Hilton Head since 2011, he has three top-10s, including a T4 from 2016. DFS STRATEGY  Cash Games — Of the top-four golfers this week, the one who seems best suited for this format is Matt Kuchar ($10,800). It was mentioned above, but Kuchar has not missed a cut at Hilton Head since before 2004.
540	540	4	4	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
510	510	7	8	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			• • •  Adam Schupak  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. The player who most reminds me of Long John Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA at Crooked Stick, is my pick. He’s coming off T-18 and T-8 in the first two legs of the FedEx Cup and will be able to bomb and gouge it this week to his third title of the season.
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
10729	10729	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
11716	11716	33	33	target: Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I care more about winning now and less about just making cuts or trying to establish myself. I feel like I've been out here long enough to show that I'm a decent player, Saunders told golf.com. Since shooting a 59 at October's Web.com Championship (in Florida) and securing his PGA Tour card, the 30-year-old has started 2018 with a top 25 at the Sony Open and T8 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
6275	6275	19	19	target: Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s desperate for a win to secure his spot on the President’s Cup team this Fall. Pivot Plays  David Lingmerth ($8,500) – I like that DK priced Lingmerth this highly because he was bound to be extreme chalk otherwise. I still love him this week, and now we should get him under 15% owned.
7610	7610	8	8	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag.
1614	1614	4	4	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Honda update Knox 45 Berger 50 Ollie 55 Grillo 80 Wiesberger 80 Horschel 100
8501	8501	16	17	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take the 40/1 each-way. A new course always means the puzzle is harder to solve but Jason Day certainly looks a prime candidate to play well. For starters, the Aussie absolutely thrives in the New York/New Jersey area.
7690	7690	0	1	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
4565	4565	31	31	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday. Martin Kaymer – $7,300  Martin Kaymer will be the most popular player this week and he is still a staple for me in cash and GPP lineups.
5621	5621	40	40	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will come into play a lot more than on a regular course, because putting will be neutralized a bit with just getting to greens being a struggle. Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
12379	12379	0	1	target: PATRICK REED 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively. Reed’s match play record in both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup is renowned.
1040	1040	47	48	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign:    First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English.
648	648	10	10	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - RBC Heritage - 2.5ew Kisner 28/1; 2ew Fitzpatrick 35/1, 2ew Henley 25/1
3442	3442	9	10	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson ($11,300) – He’s the best in the world, and I dare you to overthink it and fade him. His superior combination of indomitable length, wedge play, putting, and supreme “relaxation” (or whatever you want to call it) on the golf course make him the ultimate grind machine on tough tracks.
2024	2024	38	39	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While the top 5s won’t happen every week, Rose is coming off a T6 finish here last year, and oh by the way, he’s currently leading the PGA in strokes gained tee-to-green, scoring average, and pre-cut scoring average. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – That’s right, I’m hopping back in the Jimmy horse. He might’ve kicked me off twice already this season, but COME ON!
2802	2802	1	2	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
12304	12304	21	22	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'd expect the eventual semi-finalist to come from the bottom half of the quarter though and to that end I'm backing Patrick Reed to be the player to prevail. Opponents Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel have both been off the boil of late - the Chinese star has finished outside of the top-50 on each of his starts since winning in Dubai and the former Masters Champion hasn't managed a top-10 globally since June of last year - which leaves Jordan Spieth as Reed's biggest challenge. Of course Spieth is well capable of finding the putting form that saw him rise to the top of the world rankings back in 2015-2016, however the process changes he's been making with the flat stick are yet to bed in fully and that leaves the door open for an aggressive player like Patrick Reed to take full advantage.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2769	2769	19	20	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook. Graham DeLaet and Kevin Na. Two guys who have been turning their games around as of late and who have good records at Innisbrook.
3483	3483	1	1	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Notably, Mickelson would have to be the first of the last 19 winners to win here a year after missing the cut. That particular trend doesn’t bother me in Mickelson’s respect, with the three-time Green Jacket winner having a clear affinity with this course. That missed cut last year was just his third in 24 appearances at Augusta and as such I believe it was almost an anomaly.
785	785	18	18	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Ian Wilkerson - Wells Fargo - 2ew Simpson 40-1, Rahm 12-1; 1.5ew Casey 22-1; 1ew Swafford 66-1, JT Poston 110-1
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
6513	6513	45	46	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s going to be plenty of bogeys this week, so we need birdies to offset the damages. The top-10 in this field in recent birdie or better percentage are Phil Mickelson, Bubba Watson, Tony Finau, Stewart Cink, Kevin Streelman, Grayson Murray, Boo Weekley, James Hahn, Patrick Reed, and Xander Schauffele. Studs  *In order of my rankings  Patrick Reed ($11,200)  This guy is going to win, and he’s going to win soon.
355	355	15	15	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Didn't get to say it on the pod, but don't sleep on PXG Perez or Molinari this week. Sign me up for both!
5970	5970	9	9	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open. But what really spurs the Thomas pick is his experience at River Highlands, shooting a 62 last year to finish T-3.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
1119	1119	6	7	target: MARC LEISHMAN 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$GOLF DFS CORE FOUR$ Sony PGA MARC LEISHMAN SI WOO KIM CHRIS STROUD KEVIN NA BMW SA @EuropeanTour ERIK VAN ROOYEN… https://t.co/D1kstsROod
9478	9478	2	2	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Patrick Cantlay  Ladies and gents, meet the next generation’s Paul Casey. Albeit delayed a few years due to injury, Cantlay burst on the PGA scene in 2018 with all of the composure of a long-time veteran, making the cut in literally every event he played (13/13) with eight top-25 finishes and four top-tens.
4363	4363	30	30	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
10436	10436	23	24	target: Harris English, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The bonus here is he comes with such little risk that he’s hard to leave out of your FanDuel lineup at this price. Harris English, $8500 – About halfway down the salary list we see English, and no, this is not a misinterpretation. But it may as well be an oversight on the part of FanDuel, who priced him so low I nearly missed this diamond in the rough.
8952	8952	37	38	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Branden Grace swing sequence:  This will be the eighth time the CIMB Classic has featured on the PGA Tour. Ben Crane was the winner in 2010 and, since then, Bo Van Pelt, Nick Watney, Ryan Moore and Justin Thomas have been champions. In 2014, Moore successfully defended the title he first won in 2013.

13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
2623	2623	1	1	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson Top 5 Finish (+275); This should be a lock. I’m going with Stenson as the winner but I don’t see how he finishes outside the top 5. He hasn’t finished outside the top 10 on the European Tour since July of 2016 and this course should suit his game.
6881	6881	36	36	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore ranked 34th for DD and 12th for DA. Jordan Spieth, who is missing the tournament for the second year in-a-row, has won two of the last four renewals because he's scrambled and putted brilliantly and Moore ranked first for Scrambling and sixth for Putting Average, but the secret to success here is usually relentlessly finding the putting surfaces. Greens In Regulation is the most important stat but how you play the par fives is key too.
7589	7589	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not only is there a lack of top talent besides DJ, but the ownership projects on the golfers in the $8K range is down right criminal. Currently, Kevin Chappell has seven tags on FanShareSports, which doesn’t even come close to the golfers priced ahead of him. Chappell arguably a top five golfer in this field, but is will likely come in at under 10% ownership.
1708	1708	21	21	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Three further top-4 finishes at the CareerBuilder, WGC Cadillac and the Wells Fargo were enough to ensure a very solid year. Mickelson will be desperate to get back in the winners’ circle and this is the place for him to do so. He doesn’t stand out statistically but he must be doing something right, looking at his current form.
5094	5094	31	32	target: Jason Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After his recent missed cut (one of the few he’s had all year) I suspect he will fall off of most peoples radars. Another golfer in a very similar situation is Jason Dufner, who is well publicized to have worked heavily on his putting game all off season and it seems to be showing. It seems with his added putting skill the regular 45th place finishes of 2016 are starting to become top 25 finishes with some real upside mixed into the fold.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
5536	5536	12	12	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Add to this his ranking of 38th in Stroked Gained: Around-the-Green and Kisner ranks an impressive 5th in Strokes Gained: Total. Kisner also ranks 12th in Driving Accuracy, but ranking just 132nd in Driving Distance (286.4 yards) meant his Total Driving ranking couldn’t be any better than 32nd. Distance isn’t everything, and for someone of Kisner’s accuracy off the tee, his relative lack of power isn’t too much of a concern.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
13553	13553	6	6	target: Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That leaves me with Steele and Hoffman. Hoffman grades out better in total course history, current form, and is only slightly worse in long-term performance. I will go with Charley Hoffman this week.
10941	10941	22	23	target: Tiger Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
7471	7471	14	14	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With two of the last three winners here coming off of good Open Championships, Kuchar looks to be in a prime position to take down a weaker field. Charley Hoffman ($10,300): For many of the reasons we have to like Matt Kuchar this week, we also have to like Charley Hoffman. Hoffman played well at the Open, finishing T20, and hasn’t missed the weekend in any of his last nine starts.
934	934	1	2	target: Jamie Lovemark 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Had Jamie Lovemark matched at 45/1 in the #RSMClassic. This looks a big opportunity for him to win his first… https://t.co/n12NsBcNp2
2363	2363	17	18	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All of them placed inside the top 6 last year here. FTW I’m going to go with Adam Scott ($12,200) as my put a gun to my head pick. Fades:  Last Week’s Results: Bubba MC’d, and naturally Laird was a top 10… what a surprise.
7610	7610	8	8	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously. McGirt has great course history and his 56th rank in the world makes him nearly the tenth best ranked golfer in this field despite his near minimum salary price tag.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
13055	13055	37	38	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's currently on a run of three straight after 2-10-2 in his last three visits while he also took T8 in 2012 and T5 back in 2007  Take him at [2.42] for another. I can definitely see Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson being part of the picture too so will back both for top 10s at [2.88] and [2.84] respectively. Both can play this course in their sleep and I want to cash in on their combination of experience and impressive recent form.
192	192	27	27	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of others who could play a part in what looks a fascinating week but, at the prices, I like my trio of Reed (50/1), Watson (40/1) and Koepka (30/1). Koepka's recent putting stats are impressive (he's 10th in Strokes Gained: Putting this season) and when you put everything together he's capable of landing the title on his course debut. That should give the Californian the extra incentive to seal it in style and the other way of looking at it is that he may just feel a little more relaxed than some of the others who are the wrong side of the line and chasing.
669	669	1	1	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott has been one of the hottest golfers in the world over the past month. It’s been several months since this Aussie last notched a podium finish on the PGA Tour, but we can’t be too disappointed with three consecutive fourths to open the FedEx Cup playoffs. Needless to say, Scott will bring plenty of momentum into this week, which should give him a fighting chance against the Days and Spieths of the world.
8037	8037	36	36	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson was unlucky not to win the PGA Championship back in 2010, receiving a two-stroke penalty in the final-round, which cost him a place in the play-off with Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer. Six years on, Johnson finally got his first major win at the U.S. Open and he only looked forward from there. Following that win at the U.S. Open last June he has won five times, including three WGC’s.
12538	12538	30	30	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Holmes won’t be highlighted in many places this week as this is more of a course fit play than a stats-based play, so he should come in at low-ownership. Chris Kirk ($7500): Entering the week after a 13th-place finish at Bay Hill, Kirk is very underpriced for this tournament considering his excellent form this year: three finishes of 13th or better, three finishes between T33 and T49, and his two missed cuts both came at 54-hole cut events. Kirk is underpriced thanks to not having played this tournament since 2014 (T65), but he’s yet to miss a cut in three shots at it, and also has a T22 and a runner-up finish(!)
1127	1127	8	8	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			The PGA picks are back! Sony Open: Winner: Spieth Top 10: Howell, Woodland, Dufner DK Sleepers: Knox, Kirk OAD: Chucky Three-Stix
2838	2838	10	11	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Read below for my winner, chalk and sleepers. Predicted Winner: Bill Haas  Chalky players: Kevin Na, Dufner, Graham DeLaet and Luke Donald. Sleepers: Steve Stricker and Charley Hoffman  Hidden Sleeper I didn't mention in my video: Ollie Schniederjans
9279	9279	33	33	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But, he’s likely to go overlooked and under-owned in more “general public” contests on DraftKings, especially considering how close he is in price to the GOAT. Tiger Prediction:  Embed from Getty Images  Tiger Woods $6,500 – Eldrick Tont Woods returns yet again this year after injury to play in his own event in the Bahamas. If you aren’t in a coma and opened your phone this week, you were inundated with videos of Tiger’s swing.
8186	8186	13	13	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We estimate his ownership to fall between 26 – 30%. Value Plays:  Adam Scott $8,600 – Scott is another guy who performed well last week with three rounds in the 60’s, and has always been a premier ball striker. He ranks high in this field in SG: Off the Tee, SG: Approach and his Vegas odds to win are better or the same as Stenson, Garcia, Thomas, and Kuchar.
4126	4126	8	9	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
1667	1667	18	19	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Putting 10'-15', BoB% (Birdie or Better), Bogey Avoidance, Scrambling, Rough Proximity. Top-Tier Plays  Dustin Johnson ($11,100)  Dustin Johnson is "Taylor Made" for this course. He ranked sixth or better in three of our key stats from 2016 (1stt in BoB%, 4th in Par 5 Scoring, and 6th in Rough Proximity).
12489	12489	36	36	target: Reavie, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This year's Phoenix Open winner, Gary Woodland, doesn't frank the form particularly well. In his sole appearance in this event, he could only finish 33rd but the man he beat in the playoff in Phoenix, Chez Reavie, finished seventh here in his only appearance back in 2016. And that's especially pertinent given Reavie only managed three top-tens all year in 2016 and he was out of form when he finished seventh here.
334	334	1	2	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Dustin Johnson — D.J. doesn’t have a whole lot to show for himself at TPC Boston, but it’s hard to dislike a guy who has enjoyed the season he’s had.
1061	1061	6	6	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Some interesting prices out there. Stewgoat Cink at $6800 will prob bankrupt me
275	275	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Genesis Open Bets: Outright: DJ Scott E/W: Casey Grace Pieters English Long Shot: Donald FRL: List
1554	1554	10	10	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Genesis Open - 2ew Chappell 50-1; 4win Johnson 5-1; 1ew Rodgers 125-1, Cantlay 50-1 #GenesisOpen
11363	11363	7	7	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
877	877	0	1	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Aaron Wise winner on Web Tour &amp; T10 at TPC Summerlin 12 months ago. Birdie machine who will relish Shriners Open. https://t.co/zLqcf7SOnY
10330	10330	16	16	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.) Bill Haas ($7,000). His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000.
13627	13627	29	29	target: Fleetwood's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a correlating course perspective, his 4th at PGA National in February works very nicely with the likes of previous winners here Fowler and McIlroy being Honda Classic champions. Fleetwood's 2 Abu Dhabi successes also make sense with Quail victors Woods (3rd 2012), McIlroy (4 runner-up spots) and Fowler (1st 2016) all having success at Abu Dhabi Golf Club. You can even look at Tommy's 2nd at the 2017 WGC played at Chapultepec in a positive way with 2018 winner and runner-up Phil Mickelson and Justin Thomas not having a bad record at Quail Hollow.
2079	2079	1	2	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Bill Haas -- Haas is a great pick this week, and not just as a horse-for-course. He hasn't finished outside of the top 20 in any start this season.
827	827	7	7	target: HADWIN 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: neutral			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
1671	1671	13	13	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 3ew Thomas 12-1; 1ew Kisner 60-1, Kaymer 70-1 #HondaClassic
219	219	17	17	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
12055	12055	22	23	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's still likely to be under-owned in most formats, but he has plenty of upside at a bargain price. -- Zach Turcotte  Luke List  The Arnold Palmer Invitational sets up to be another good spot for Luke List after quality fantasy performances in the Valspar Championship, Honda Classic, Genesis Open, Waste Management Phoenix Open and Farmers Insurance Open. Rating near the top in BOB% and Par-5 Scoring, List should do his fair share of scoring at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge.
735	735	31	32	target: Martin Laird, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Chris Kirk, Nick Watney. 1 - Sang-moon Bae; Jonas Blixt, Jonathan Byrd, Bryson DeChambeau, Luke Donald, Ernie Els, Charley Hoffman, Billy Horschel, Billy Hurley III, Smylie Kaufman, Russell Knox, Martin Laird, David Lingmerth, Hunter Mahan, Ben Martin, Troy Merritt, Kevin Na, Geoff Ogilvy, Rod Pampling, Ted Potter Jnr, Rory Sabbatini, Vijay Singh, Scott Stallings, Kevin Streelman, Camilo Villegas. Course experience here is an important factor but course debutants shouldn't be overlooked either.
10979	10979	26	27	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not too strict, but definitely helps avoid the golfers that should be reserved for GPPs only:  Sangmoon Bae  Tom Hoge  K.J. Choi  Jonas Blixt  The Specialists  Jason Kokrak  Chez Reavie  Vaughn Taylor  Keegan Bradley  Jimmy Walker  The specialist this week is Jason Kokrak! This masher finished T34-79-MC-T41 in his first four trips to Riviera CC.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
3415	3415	8	9	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler at 22/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Bill Haas at 100/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w. Marc Leishman at 66/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)  1pt e.w.
2043	2043	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great value at his price considering he has the 4th best Vegas odds but only the 7th most expensive player on the board. Mid Range Picks  Patrick Reed ($8,300)  Reed is absurdly underpriced. He’s a consistent cut-maker with a solid track record here.
10731	10731	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because his short game is so good, he doesn’t have to contend with length off the tee as an obstacle. Reed could pop here; his problem is usually a lackluster Saturday. If he holds steady on Saturday, look out Sunday!
5688	5688	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Worth a GPP team or 2. Matt Kuchar $7,600 – In a tournament that demands mental strength I will want some of the old guy who has been there, done that and doesn’t get too rattled. He also has made the cut (46-12-12-28) the last 4 years.
6521	6521	1	2	target: Johnson Wagner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steals  Johnson Wagner ($7,700)  With harder pricing this week, I don’t think many people will target this range of golfers. If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play. Wagner is notorious for fast starts on Thursdays, and he was finally able to sustain that and post a top-5 finish last weekend.
10129	10129	10	10	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So why not use the CareerBuilder as a tune-up? Beyond Rahm, Brian Harman, on the heel of his recent HOT FIYA run, is the only other member of the world’s top 20 in the CareerBuilder field. Failing to convert another 36-hole lead at the Sony Open, the 3-foot-7 Harman is one of 10 players teeing it up for the third consecutive week to begin the year.
4990	4990	13	13	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also 27th in SGT2G, T30 in ball striking, 37th in P4P. Chris Kirk - $8,200    Until a couple of weeks ago, this is not a pick we would've made and still may be a gamble. However, Kirk tied for 12th at The Players, giving him his first top-20 since November (yes, November).
9554	9554	16	16	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Last season, Smith was ranked eighth on the PGA Tour in putting average. Long-Shot Values    Bryson DeChambeau - $7,000 (60-1)    DeChambeau notched three top-20s in the fall season. He ranks 41st in proximity so far this season.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
6350	6350	1	1	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Taylor – GPP Punt – DK: $6700 FD: $5400  Maybe it’s my Canadian bias coming through but here’s another Canadian that sets up for any par 70 course. For me, Taylor stands out to me in the range of players in the bottom few $100 of salary. Our VIP Spreadsheet shows Taylor gaining strokes to the field Tee-to-Green which is huge anytime you can get a punt play who is doing that.
1005	1005	5	6	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge! If you want to win at DraftKings daily fantasy golf, you have to figure out a way to find six golfers that play all 72 holes and earn roughly 85 points each.
7390	7390	32	33	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To say the least, this course is definitely a bit of a bomber’s paradise. Obviously, this is not to say that shorter hitters won’t be able to jump all over it – Matt Kuchar has destroyed this course the past three times he’s played it – but if you have limited penalty for missing the fairway with short Par 5s and bentgrass greens, that’s pretty much the green light special for your favorite big hitters. Let’s jump into some picks.
10733	10733	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk. Kirk is always a solid putter and relies on his irons, so take some GPP shares of Kirk this week.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
1154	1154	3	4	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY SLEEPER : Jimmy Walker ($6,500)  Let’s be honest, in an 18-man field there’s not really any “sleeper” picks. Still, I do think Jimmy Walker could go under the radar due to his poor recent form. Walker has had a strange if not marvelous 2016.
2929	2929	15	15	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I love those types of golf courses that reward good golf but punish sloppy play." Rose won Memorial in 2010 (his first PGA Tour victory) and you know he'd be a fitting winner and would say all the right things if he were to win the first running of the tournament since Arnie passed. Already on Twitter, he's posted: "The most important follow this week... @APinv #TheKing."
1429	1429	0	1	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak is $6900 on DK and is averaging 69 points over his last 7 events. All in.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10	10	37	38	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And so, I'm taking a guy who doesn't own a great track record here -- just one career top-10 against a bunch of missed cuts -- but has played some inspired golf this year. Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009.
10941	10941	22	22	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.
756	756	12	12	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
261	261	19	20	target: CHEZ REAVIE 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Guys I might not have on DraftKings but bet them because I like their odds: NICK TAYLOR (585/1) and CHEZ REAVIE (450/1). ⛳️
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
6102	6102	12	12	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			All three of these guys are typically mid to upper 7k range. Hadwin hasn’t been “stellar” but seems to always make the cut. Lee and Taylor have been a bit hotter lately and I like their birdie potential.
5462	5462	4	5	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Piercy ($8,500)  9. Phil Mickelson ($10,200)  11. Francesco Molinari ($10,500)  Recommended Lineup  Francesco Molinari: $10,500  Molinari finished second at the BMW PGA Championship on the European Tour in his most recent action.
7503	7503	18	18	target: Hadwin, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With a relatively weak field, this could be Cantlay's platform to shine. The gamble in this group is Hadwin, who took the tour by storm in the early parts of 2017 with a win, four top-10s and a 59, yet has been a non-entity as of late (missing three of his past five cuts). However, he does have two top-10s at this event, including a T-7 at Glen Abbey in 2015.
1246	1246	10	10	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was eighth on tour in scrambling last season. Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013.
7462	7462	13	13	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a good min-price punt this week. Others: Robert Garrigus  High-upside GPP Picks  Bubba Watson ($9,400): Watson has picked up the pace a bit over his couple of starts and comes in off the back of three straight made cuts and a T27 at last weeks Open. It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well.
10743	10743	20	20	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure. (Note: It is worth following how Day says his back is feeling prior to Thursday.)
11766	11766	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style. Matt Kuchar – Cash – DK: $8200 FD: $10600  Although last weekend was rough for Matt Kuchar, I have full confidence to go back to him in cash game contests this week.
2007	2007	22	22	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His name isn’t Pee Wee either. Here is this weeks DK squad:  $10,000 Sneds  $7,900 Castro  $6,900 TRUMPS BOY  $7,000 Jones  $8,800 Walker  $9,300 Mickelson  Wagering:  1st Round Leader  Sneds 25/1  Hadwin 60/1  Kirk 65/1  Hossler 120/1  Sabbatini 120/1  Mahan 140/1  Small wagers here for a fun first day. Went with mainly MP and PB guys to start.
1350	1350	2	3	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Patrick Reed is a great bet at 60/1. Course History and extreme recent form being overvalued by the books.… https://t.co/TbrLwKNofc
5896	5896	31	31	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Travelers Championship - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Bubba Watson 1.5pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Bubba Watson makes a lot of sense this week and with Day, McIlroy and Spieth all in the field, it's great to see 33/1 about the 2-time Travelers champion. Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner.
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
1636	1636	3	3	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Consensus #HondaClassic Futures Berger +4500 Scott +5000 Henley +5000 Bradley +9000 Going for our 4th outright win of 2018! #BetGolf
6827	6827	9	10	target: Rory Sabbatini 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's because he's currently 132nd in the FedExCup standings. Rory Sabbatini … He's only 41 years old, but he's been around long enough to have competed in the final edition of the John Deere Classic at Oakwood Country Club as a PGA TOUR rookie in 1999. The South African may have wondered why he didn't back to the Quad Cities sooner than 2012.
2201	2201	20	20	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			He’s close, and Riviera has been kind to him – top-4 finishes five times since T-10 in 2009. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
4103	4103	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A win in Fiji on the PGA Tour of Australasia two years ago slightly saves face, but there are obvious concerns at $11,500 and I am tempted to fade him this week. Brooks Koepka ($10,900) – Brooks Koepka at $10,900, are you crazy? Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best.
4499	4499	30	30	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball. However, I can't help but think Kaymer is in a very good place right now having finally dome something good at Augusta. It wasn't earth-shattering but T16 beat his previous best of T31 and his 68s in rounds two and four were, amazingly, the first time he'd ever broken 70.
10492	10492	21	22	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, with lower ownership, you are not going to need much exposure to be overweight on the field. $6K-$7K Range  Both Zach Johnson and Kevin Chappell will be 15%+ in GPP's this week at $7,700 on DraftKings. I am leaning Zach Johnson as he comes back to TPC Scottsdale with excellent course history with Top 15 finishes in three straight years and has been very consistent so far this year.
5838	5838	27	28	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kevin Kisner – Sizzling after his win at Colonial and T-6 at Memorial, Kisner’s proven that he doesn’t mind a bit of Bentgrass on the greens. He’s Rickie Fowler “light”, and that’s meant as a compliment as he checks in fifth in SG: Total and registers in the top 40 of the major statistical categories. He’s absolutely solid through the entire bag.
727	727	14	14	target: Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
4171	4171	14	14	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While both make their debuts at TPC Louisiana, it’s a Pete Dye design and Grace has already thrived on such courses despite limited opportunities, most notably when winning at Harbour Town a year ago. Oosthuizen’s long, straight driving has to be considered a huge asset given the roll of honour at this lengthy par 72, and like Grace he’s been on the fringes of contention for much of 2017 without quite putting the pieces together, although he was mighty close in Phoenix back in February. The chief reason for liking them here is that we know they are a formidable force both when sharing a ball and when playing their own.
4008	4008	4	4	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Lock and load. Adam Hadwin ($9,100) – Seriously, how long can we ride the Hadwin train. I am not hopping off as he is playing the golf of his life.
10623	10623	2	3	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price. The American already has on his CV a win in a top-class field on the California coast.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
2029	2029	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
1161	1161	15	15	target: Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Golf Card: Rose (-105) over Rory E/W Career Builder Sneds 35/1 Knox 40/1 Chappell 40/1 Piercy 80/1 Only Tuesday… https://t.co/rdOWWq7C59
8042	8042	22	22	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He does not play at Quail Hollow every year, but in the starts he has made he has yielded some good results. Johnson finished 14th here in 2014 after the changes were made to the greens and before that had finished 6th in 2011 and 11th in 2009. The changes made this week don’t play into Johnson’s hands, with the course being lengthened but as we know Johnsons is capable of winning and contending at courses that appear too long for him.
7398	7398	2	2	target: Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
11001	11001	0	1	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Cantlay ($7,600): Cantlay was $8,900 at last week’s Pebble Beach Pro-Am and was $9,500 at the Farmers Insurance Open the week prior to that, so it’s safe to say he presents solid value this week. Perhaps Cantlay’s two missed cuts (back in 2012 and 2013) at Riviera threw a wrench into DraftKings pricing algorithm? Cantlay’s LT Adj Rd Score (68.5) is tied for fifth, while his LT GIR percentage (69.7) is tied for 16th and LT Adj Bird Avg (15.4) ranks seventh.
8017	8017	36	36	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
1673	1673	13	13	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When you look at his stats and course history, you can see why. Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016.
3807	3807	23	24	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mori Yoshimoto  @Bears3423    Last Week: 348.5 points  Last Week Rank: 5,177    Kevin Na ($29,500)  William McGirt ($29,000)  Lucas Glover ($15,700)  Kyle Stanley ($12,200)  Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)  John Peterson ($4,300)    ANALYSIS: Ball-striking is the name of the game here for Mo. If Valspar proves to be a worthy pointer like it often does than Cantlay's runner-up finish there looks even better. Yahoo!
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
4230	4230	1	2	target: B. Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. B. Haas – Should be playing better than he is. Look for a top 5 here.
2032	2032	6	6	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
5154	5154	43	44	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the highest purse behind only the four majors, THE PLAYERS, and the four WGC events, there’s plenty to get excited about in Columbus this week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – William McGirt  2015 – David Lingmerth  2014 – Hideki Matsuyama  2013 – Matt Kuchar  2012 – Tiger Woods  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Justin Rose  2009 – Tiger Woods  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – K.J. Choi    Key Stats to Winning at Muirfield Village    • Driving Distance  • Par-5 Scoring  • Scrambling percentage    Champion’s Profile    As only Jack would have it, Muirfield’s par-5s are scoring holes and the greens are lightning-quick.
13568	13568	19	20	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As of midday Wednesday, he's way out front in ownership percentage at 20 percent. That's eight clicks better than Luke List in second and 14 points clear of both Sergio Garcia and Brendan Steele. Surely, there are options.
568	568	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
7685	7685	23	24	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is the defending champion. Pinterest Chris Condon  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Dustin Johnson  Jason Day  Rory McIlroy  Hideki Matsuyama  Brooks Koepka  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Bubba Watson  Professor's Explanation: Firestone is a big track. It is a "bombers and gorgers" kind of place.
11228	11228	16	17	target: Brian Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In two previous starts at PGA National he has finished 17th or better. -- Zach Turcotte  Brian Gay  Between his poor course history and not being a household name, Gay is going to be off most people's radar this week. Couple those things with a missed cut at last week's Genesis Open, and you might think I'm crazy.
3791	3791	20	20	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has played very well around here before finishing T2 last year, T18 in 2015 and T9 in 2014. Staswise Knox ranks 10th in driving accuracy which is a plus around here. If he starts well the Scot could regain some of that early season form on a course that clearly suits his eye.
413	413	64	65	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He talks about his 1st Masters experience and the impact of Draft Kings and Fantasy Free View in iTunes  139 Clean WGC Cadillac 2016 W/ PGATour Caddie Paul Tesori PGATour Caddie, Paul Tesori talks about life on Tour, caddying for Webb Simpson, caddie preparation, and the Tesori Family Foundation on this week's episode.

2193	2193	11	12	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he loves Riviera, with six top 10s in nine starts. Dustin Johnson. It’s going to be wet and soggy again this week, and he has the length to handle it.
5980	5980	6	7	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
3300	3300	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes(-16) 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's take a look at the last five year's winners and the scorecard before jumping into the fantasy approach. 2016 - Jim Herman(-15)  - Jim Herman(-15) 2015 - J.B. Holmes(-16)  - J.B. Holmes(-16) 2014 - Matt Jones(-15)  - Matt Jones(-15) 2013 - D.A. Points(-16)  - D.A.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
10990	10990	7	8	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6 cuts made in a row here. Kevin Chappell $7,700 – He has really weird course history. MC 26th MC 23rd MC 24th MC.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
3246	3246	18	18	target: Tringale 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- At 50-to-1, this horse-for-course pick also had a very strong showing at the WGC-Match Play. Longshot: Cameron Tringale -- We don't typically dig this deep, but at 150-to-1, Tringale is worth a few quid, particularly on an each-way bet, given his track record in this tournament. 2017 Shell Houston Open betting odds
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
5621	5621	40	40	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will come into play a lot more than on a regular course, because putting will be neutralized a bit with just getting to greens being a struggle. Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy.
6636	6636	21	22	target: Curtis Luck 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As the defending champion of the Greenbrier Classic - why should you keep an eye on him this weekend? And finally, Curtis Luck might be just a rookie - but why might he surprise the field in Virginia? Tune in to find you that and more!
9148	9148	15	16	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’re comfortable enough with Nick in GPPs or cash game contests. Best bargain basement option:  Aaron Wise $6,900 – We love Wise this week in GPP contests as we anticipate his ownership around 5%. Wise trains at TPC Summerlin and calls it a home track.
12143	12143	50	50	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He cited allergies as the cause of his withdrawal then rolled up at Augusta next time out and won the US Masters for a second time. As is typical with the wildly unpredictable Bubba, there have also been three missed cuts here but there have also been renewals in which Watson has shown that he has exactly the right game for the venue. In ten previous visits, his best finishes are an eighth ten years ago and a fourth in 2012 and he's sat inside the top-seven places after round one on three previous occasions.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
12705	12705	26	27	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2011 winner, Charl Schwartzel, hadn't been in stellar really recent form but he'd won on the European Tour three months before he won the Masters. Bubba Watson had finished second at the WGC-Cadillac Championship (now the WGC-Mexico Championship) and fourth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational before he won the first of his two titles in 2012. Adam Scott had been third in the WGC-Cadillac in his penultimate start before his 2013 victory.
13054	13054	46	46	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries. Second and fifth on his last two starts, Woods will now look to add to a body of work at Augusta National which shows four wins and nine other top 10s, seven of those top fives. If you can't quite see Tiger getting it done, a top 5 or top 10 punt could be a very good way of cheering him on.
1673	1673	13	13	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When you look at his stats and course history, you can see why. Woodland has made his last six cuts at the Farmers Insurance Open, including an 18th and a 10th. Like DJ and Fowler, Woodland takes full advantage of the Par 5s, ranking 7th in Par 5 Scoring in 2016.
41	41	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#TheBarclays Long Shot Bets: Vegas 150/1, Stefani 250/1, Glover 150/1.
1981	1981	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, there's that gamble. Kirk skipped Pebble last year and missed the cut the year before, He was runner-up to Snedeker in 2013. Stewart Cink - $7,500 (Field, 3-1)    Cink is playing this year via his one-time career money list exemption, and he's making the most of it.
8851	8851	33	34	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Matt Kuchar being priced at $7,700 on Draftkings he will make a great cash-game play or just throw him in as a core player in your GPP lineups, you won't regret it. Paul Casey @ $8,600  I don't think that there's a whole lot that I need to say about Paul Casey. He plays great at this venue and the narrative is there because he has a lot to play for this week.
2357	2357	1	1	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays. Grace is also 37th in greens in regulation percentage. There’s also the fact seven of the last nine winners of the Honda Classic weren’t from the United States.
7630	7630	32	33	target: Patrick Cantlay, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s projected for a chalky 26-30 percent ownership and leads all golfers this week with 11 Pro Trends. The Value Plays  Perhaps the most intriguing golfer in the field this week is Patrick Cantlay, a 25-year-old golfer who was formerly the world’s No. 1 amateur.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
1673	1673	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@TheHondaClassic Picks Fleetwood 30 Noren 33 Reed 50 Hadley 55 Rafa 55 Ollie 60 Kisner 60 Louie 70
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
4364	4364	6	6	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down. Sleepers  We are going to try something new this week with the new format.
10691	10691	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has been playing some decent golf over the last couple of months with five top 11’s and a win in his last eight competitive starts. Day finished in a respectable T9 at the PGA Championship back in August followed by a T6 at the Northern Trust Open in Glen Oaks shooting a 69 or better in three of his four rounds. The Aussie then travelled to the BMW Championship in Conway Farms finishing solo fourth which included an opening 64 and a second round 65.
3649	3649	53	53	target: Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It worries me slightly here with so much around-the-green work to be done, but if he continues to lap the field in SG: Approach and Putting, he’ll make enough birdies to counteract the hiccups. Oh, he’s the highest ranked player in the field too (16th), don’t forget that… I’m such a sucker for Dufner. He’s never been a great Pete Dye player, but his game theoretically translates perfectly.
11018	11018	30	31	target: Tom Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Tom Hoge $6,600 – Hollywood Hoge is somewhat of a gut call down here in this range. He’s a tremendous ball striker from tee to green but cursed with the ever elusive hot and cold putter.
688	688	10	10	target: Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - Texas Open - 2ew C Hoffman 25-1; 1ew Grace 28-1, Chappell 33-1, Horschel 35-1, Moore 28-1
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
3778	3778	30	31	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We're targeting ball strikers this week, and Glover ranks near the top in those categories this year and should be on your radar as a GPP play. -- Taras Pitra  Jason Kokrak  Not a guy who will garner a lot of attention coming into Harbourtown, but quietly he has made five consecutive cuts, including a Top 25 at The Genesis Open. I also like his tournament history, where he is riding three consecutive Top 20s with a sixth place here last year.
1045	1045	7	7	target: Bryson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SentryTOC Card 💰💰💰 Kiz 28-1 Harman 35-1 Bryson 66-1 Dufner 80-1 Si WOOOOOO 100-1 Cook 100-1 *EW on Bryson and below
4099	4099	33	34	target: Kevin Chappell. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  • • •  Jeff Babineau  Projected champion: Kevin Chappell. Just a hunch.
11373	11373	35	35	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It was interesting listening to Phil Mickelson in interview last year here where he talked at length about the nuances of altitude golf and how it can favour 'feel golfers' such as himself and with Bubba cut from a similar cloth in that respect, I can see him enjoying this week after finishing 38th on debut 12 months ago when at a very low ebb. Classical courses carry no concerns for Watson who's twice mastered Augusta National - and who's to say he won't contend again this year - and those tracks featuring Kikuyu on the fairways and rough and Poa Annua on the greens are clearly no issue, as was once again demonstrated at the Genesis on his last start. Twice in the past Watson's seriously contended at this event's predecessor at Doral after winning at Riviera - finishing 2nd in both 2014 and 2016 - and he's worth chancing at the price on offer this week in my view.
463	463	2	2	target: Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Thoughts on Brehm at $5900 on DK? 9th in DD / 33rd in BirdieAvg on @WebDotComTour last year. Slow greens neutralize poor putting... #DFS
7662	7662	6	7	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recommended bets: WGC-Bridgestone Invitational      1pt e.w. Jason Dufner at 66/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) - straight hitter and that's a key trait that's needed at Firestone  1pt e.w. Justin Thomas at 50/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) - good record in Ohio and likely to be inspired by friend Spieth's Open show  1pt e.w.
4085	4085	46	47	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ownership projections you see here are my initial projections and will be updated as the week goes on so be sure to follow me on twitter to find out where you can get all the most updated ownership information. While it’s still early, this week Patrick Reed looks to be a good candidate if you’re looking for low ownership. While it’s clear he isn’t playing great now, his price has continued to drop and at some point you can expect Patrick Reed to bounce back.
1713	1713	1	2	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Boosted Patrick Cantlay to 50/1 with Ladbrokes for WGC Mexico. Had worse prices in my time
1023	1023	36	37	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After picking him to play well in Mexico and watching him miss the cut, I need to see more out of Furyk before I put him in another lineup. • • •  Mike Glasscott  Projected champion: Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ.
957	957	68	69	target: Ryan Blaum 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vaughn Taylor ($6,300) – Has been playing well as of late, with a recent 15th at the Safeway Open, and has a 16th and a 25th in his two starts at this tourney. My main lineup in DraftKings this week as of right now, with $0 in the budget to spare: Russell Knox ($11,800), Si Woo Kim ($8,900), John Huh ($7,600), Charles Howell ($7,500), Shawn Stefani ($7,300), and Ryan Blaum ($6,900). Don’t yet have a daily fantasy sports account yet on FanDuel or DraftKings?
1938	1938	18	19	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Final selections –  Brandt Snedeker 20/1 1pt EW  Phil Mickelson 20/1 0.5pts EW  Jon Rahm 22/1 0.5pts EW  Patrick Reed 33/1 0.5pts EW  Total staked = 5 pts  Good luck and enjoy the golf,  Doublebogey6  Follow me on social media –  Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/doublebogey6/  Twitter – www.twitter.com/doublebogeyDB6 Reed is a bit streaky lately but could be worth a risk here with his previous record. Statswise his game looks to really suit this course ranking sixth in SG around the green, fifth in SGP and 32nd in SGTTG.
1656	1656	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He did miss the cut in 2014, as he battled his way through injuries, and finished T19 in 2015. The MC was a hiccup, with issues physically, much like Day when he’s gone in at full health, he’s dominated the event. He comes in at 33rd this week, as his Par 5 performance last season wasn’t as good as we’ve seen.
1887	1887	11	12	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All the courses in the rotation have impressed me this year." Justin Rose [on Monterrey Peninsula] : "The greens aren't as good here. They're bouncing a little bit, but they're also really quick.
7268	7268	1	1	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar ($7,500 | 50/1) - Kuchar's odds sit at 50/1 after being 66/1 on Friday afternoon. Kuchar has found some form at the Open in the past after being cut in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. He was 9th in 2012 and 15th in 2013 before sitting 54th, 58th, and 46th in the past three years.
1257	1257	5	5	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I just hammered this one....also Woodland over Reed is another favorite of mine- parlay both together for like +250… https://t.co/AVYRXbChCh
1308	1308	17	18	target: Chris Kirk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - Daniel Berger, K.J.

6986	6986	26	26	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dean & DeLuca Invitational - Final Round Stacy Revere  Now, I’m in a bit of a bind again with some of my choices. Both Johnson and Watson have been playing nowhere near their historical averages, yet the Model puts them in the ten picks. Well, I’ll just have to live with that.
11312	11312	79	80	target: Patrick Cantlay. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watching Phil over recent weeks I feel like I’ve been watching a loop of a tape where his putts keep hanging on the edge or burning the edges and if he can just get one or two more to drop this could at last be his week. PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price.
1636	1636	39	39	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In addition to his win here, he played very well for most of the 2016 US Open finishing T2 behind Dustin Johnson. A player capable of playing in bad conditions is always good to have on side and with Snedeker and Lowry we have two. What also appeals about Lowry is his course history.
10941	10941	23	23	target: Woods, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera favors ball strikers much like the Phoenix Open and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making Reavie a steal this week under $10,000. Tiger Woods, $9300 – I haven’t recommended Tiger as a value since 2013, but in his first return to Riviera since 2006, Woods is a bit underrated. Though Riviera is probably the one course Tiger really hasn’t “tamed” in his career, The efforts we saw at Torrey Pines lead me to believe his ball striking will improve and has least net him a made cut with upside for more this week.

7497	7497	18	19	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
1609	1609	18	18	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird looks to have a lot going for him here. It may seem a dubious play to Hudson Swafford just days on from his first Tour win. After all, he may just be happy to drink in that success and coast along here and enjoy the spectacular clifftop views.
2026	2026	48	48	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But seriously, he hasn’t missed three cuts in a row since 2013, his play earlier in this season has still been solid, and his history in this tournament is just as sensational as the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open. So while others hopefully zag away from Walker, I will keep zigging and just address the elephant in the room later if he burns me again. Middle of the Road  Phil Mickelson $9,300 – Here’s a fun thing: apparently mild hernias are not that hard to recover from.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
2992	2992	12	13	target: Jonas Blixt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With rain a distinct possibility, Harold also thrives on receptive golf courses.

2611	2611	47	48	target: Jason Dufner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
6307	6307	6	6	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After starting the season off poorly, Haas has turned it around with decent showings his past few times out. Haas keeps in the fairway off the tee and hits a ton of greens, which should help him avoid any big numbers. This seems like a “slow and steady” type of course, and that plays nicely into what Haas does well.
8939	8939	38	39	target: Gary Woodland. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's joined by the Tour Championship winner Xander Schauffele and runner-up here 12 months ago Hideki Matsuyama. This week's field also includes Tour Championship qualifiers Paul Casey, Jason Dufner, Adam Hadwin, Pat Perez, Kyle Stanley, Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland. Throw-in talented players of the ilk of course winner Anirban Lahiri, Branden Grace, Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel and Thomas Pieters.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
4057	4057	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not bad for a guy priced this low. Stewart Cink ($16,100) – Another guy that can provide savings, Cink is a steady cut maker (let’s forget about last week). As a bonus, Cink checks the box in nearly every category we are diving into this week.

12398	12398	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you're chasing and have no qualms about sending anyone out, zone in on the last four champions – Day (2014, 2016), McIlroy (2015) and Dustin Johnson (2017). Day and DJ could square off in the quarterfinals, but you already knew that. Bring it on.
6532	6532	8	8	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like that combination. -- Jason Sobel  Jimmy Walker  Just when you thought he was done, Walker gets to return to a course where it has always been feast or famine: two missed cuts (including 2014, the last time he played the tournament), as well as two fourth-place ties and a runner-up to boot. "Sky" Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7.
6278	6278	36	37	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes in 12th overall in my model this week due to his lower ranks in Par 4 Scoring(64th) and BoB%(47th) but ranks 13th in SG: OTT + APP which really draws my attention this week. Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win.
4375	4375	28	28	target: McGirt’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Eagle Point is a 2nd shot golf course as you have to be on the right tier of these greens to have a chance at birdie. This suits McGirt’s game pretty well. We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests.
2818	2818	26	27	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Look for Donald to navigate Copperhead intelligently and put up a top-20 finish this week, which I will take for a $7,800 price tag. Zach Turcotte: Jason Dufner ($7,900)  Dufner has been really consistent over the last couple of seasons and the start of 2017 has been no different with Dufner posting four top-25 finishes to start the calendar year. He has been excellent at Copperhead, making the cut in his last eight starts and never finishing lower than 28th during that stretch.
4014	4014	20	21	target: Charley Hoffman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plug him in and don’t check your lineups until Friday night to avoid any mid-round tilt. Also Consider: Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Ollie Schneiderjans  Dark Horse  Luke List ($7,600) – Oh man, you aren’t writing up List again are you? He burned some beautiful lineups last weekend.
9100	9100	2	3	target: Matthew Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Matthew Fitzpatrick at 35/1 with Betfred He’s won big tournaments before including the British Masters and DP World Tour Championship and competing for WGCs and majors is the next logical step on his career. Ranked inside the top-40 in the world now is the opportunity for him to make the breakthrough at a world level.
12123	12123	30	31	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In addition to the meaty bet on Tommy I've also had much smaller wagers on Henrik Stenson (MC last week and last year here but great course form before that), Bubba Watson (played well here before he played well anywhere and already a winner this year), Zach Johnson (course form and a good week at the Valspar despite a poorly behaved putter) and Patton Kizzire (two wins already this season, ranks highly on the par fives and just too big at a triple-figure price). Selections:  Tommy Fleetwood @ [27.0]  Henrik Stenson @ [38.0]  Bubba Watson @ [46.0]  Zach Johnson @ [90.0]  Patton Kizzire @ [120.0]  There's no European Tour action this week so I'll be back on Friday with the In-Play Blog. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
3392	3392	35	36	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even if you do hole them you have to hole them comfortably because if you’re grinding over every three-footer it becomes a burden. Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well.
8229	8229	56	56	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s the final major of the PGA Tour season and very likely the final golf Millionaire Maker on DraftKings until the Masters next April, so finding a low-owned player that produces a ton of fantasy points will be one of the keys to making a run in a huge guaranteed prize pool (GPP) like that. Amazing Grace  A few weeks ago, Branden Grace went goofy with a third-round 63 at the Open Championship — a round that propelled him to a sixth-place finish in that event. Per our Trends tool, in his last 11 majors, Grace has produced a very valuable +7.99 Plus/Minus with 63.6 percent Consistency.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
5220	5220	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years. Haas only has seven tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to an equally priced Byeong Hun An, who has 20.
2761	2761	22	22	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also finished 2nd in tee to green at Honda Classic. Checking the box in multiple categories and playing back in Florida, Billy Ho is our other dark horse this week. Others to consider: CT Pan, Steve Stricker  Chalk to Fade  Matt Kuchar ($10,400) – Yes, Kuchar provides you that “safety” you want in a cash game play.
1023	1023	7	7	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is GOLDEN CHERUB chalk week. Cam Smith has been HOT, can he keep it going as a first timer? We shall see.....… https://t.co/0qiHzBRD0y
11777	11777	22	23	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With four par 5s on hand this week, I like the Georgia Bulldog who has seven eagles in his last 10 starts. Aaron Wise ($8,100): The Oregon standout is generally lights out with his long irons which should be key this week. He's a West Coast guy but these overseeded greens don't require a steep learning curve.
7609	7609	34	34	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			These are questions you should be asking every week if you are serious about DFS, and now you can get the answer in one easy chart. A quick glance at this chart and Will McGirt should instantly stand out to you. I suspect a quick glance at the list of salaries may have warranted the same results which means McGirt will most likely suffer from the ‘cluster effect’ of ownership I mentioned previously.
7570	7570	18	18	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
13503	13503	16	17	target: Julian Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Advanced statistics support Streelman’s case too ranking him in the Top 10 in value this week. Julian Suri ($7,600) – Julian Suri mainly plays on the European Tour, but he’s shown lately that he can certainly hack it over here. More specifically, he can hack it in Texas.
13216	13216	37	37	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Full team course history with this play because he has not been playing well at all. Betting Card  Outrights:  Hadwin 33/1 WD  Grillo 40/1  Kisner 45/1  List 55/1  Molinari 60/1 + E/W  Si Woo 100/1 + T10  Cook 100/1 + T10  T10 – Donald 10/1  It’s grown more than I intended but they are pretty light bets on the bottom 5 guys, with the emphasis at the top. Be sure to follow me on twitter (@FantasyJesusDFS) if you don’t already.
5298	5298	19	19	target: Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With it being a par-70, the par-5 scoring won’t be an impactful loss. Because of the accuracy and steadiness, Reavie is 27th in Bogey Avoidance, but he’s also been steady on the greens at 16th in 3-Putt Avoidance. He doesn’t score enough to make him an elite DraftKings play, but he can finish high enough here to pay off his cheap salary.
21	21	15	15	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: neutral			I don't care what stats or data you show me, I'm never paying $8,700 for McGirt when Justin Thomas is $8,600. Take my money.
2207	2207	18	18	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Jordan Spieth. Why back off now?
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
9692	9692	15	16	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watch those Fanshare tags, if he is low then I’ll be all over him. “Value”  Gary Woodland $7,800 – His last 3 starts here: 6th, 13th, 3rd. I will have plenty and he will more than likely be on my cash team.
456	456	8	9	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
8440	8440	47	48	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some stats below from the opening round of the Playoffs over the past few years:  P ath to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Patrick Reed: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 1st, Round 3: 2nd. 2015 - Jason Day: Round 1: 18th, Round 2: 8th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Hunter Mahan: Round 1: 2nd, Round 2: 12th, Round 3: 3rd.
13060	13060	36	37	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we are focusing on the 8K and up range this week, all of these guys have a legitimate chance of winning this tournament, but like I said earlier, you have to make a stand somewhere. Phil Mickelson: DK $9500/FD $11200  All you really need to do is look at the picture at the top of this page. Phil is wearing a collared, button up shirt, with his jumpman logo on the cuffs, in a practice round.
6540	6540	6	7	target: Johnson Wagner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Adam Daly  FanDuel value picks  Johnson Wagner  Some players are really tough to get a handle on from week to week, and few are more of a mystery each year than Wagner. Using Wagner can be a lot like trying to catch a falling knife, but he goes through a stretch or two each season where picks up enough points to keep his tour card. When he is on, he hits greens as well as anyone on tour.
5097	5097	30	31	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And when that same player shot a 79 in his last competitive round, surely the combined evidence is enough to make you stay well clear. The above all applies to Rickie Fowler and yet I cannot get away from him at 30/1 this week. The hard, cold facts are that the American has MC-MC-MC here from 2014-2016 but, to me, it just doesn't make any sense.
3042	3042	1	1	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk ($9,100) – Kirk has missed back-to-back cuts on tough tracks, and now comes to an easy course in a weak field. This is a Chris Kirk specialty if I ever saw one. I have a slight concern with Kirk in that he’s never played here before, but raw talent should get him into contention this week.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
8514	8514	20	20	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			His putting can be tilting at times but his ballstriking should help limit blowup holes. In his last 24 rounds, Molinari ranks 2nd in Par 4 Scoring, 3rd in GIR%, 7th in BoB%, and 9th in SG:T2G. I will be using Molinari in both formats.
2320	2320	40	41	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don’t expect much different this week either. Beyond Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas, all the top ranked players in the field are internationals: Scott, Sergio Garcia, Paul Casey, Branden Grace, Russell Knox, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Francesco Molinari, Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald and Thomas Pieters. We even get a quartet of Brits making the trek to America for the first time this year: Danny Willet, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Ty Hatton and Ian Poulter.
9697	9697	0	1	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gary Woodland – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10200  On the surface, it seems surprising that Woodland would be a cash game play at this event. Although he known for being one of the longest drivers on the tour Woodland is also able to keep the ball in play. At this event, this has resulted in a T6, T13 and T3 the last three years here at the Sony Open.
2471	2471	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes to Mexico and a course that should suit him perfectly: birdies, accuracy, and ball-striking. Garcia was excellent off-the-tee last week, but struggled mightily on the greens. He should be in for some positive regression this week.
8549	8549	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He followed that with a T15 at Memorial, T27 at The Open Championship and a T24 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. Day played well in this event over the last few years finishing T4 last year, a win in 2015 and a T2 in 2014. Statswise he ranks 23rd in driving distance, second in SG around the green, 47th in SGP and 17th in par 5 scoring.
7912	7912	13	14	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(He's the Wild Card in the Fantasy Insider column.) But that's OK because Justin Rose is a suitable surrogate. At No.
10350	10350	21	21	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now he'll head to his old stomping grounds in Scottsdale, the area he played his college golf. After a tough Saturday, Rahm may have shifted his focus to Phoenix a bit early. Given his comfort in the area, I wouldn't be worried about any fatigue issues.
5192	5192	1	1	target: Scott: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adam Scott: Scott hasn’t played here since 2014, when he finished fourth. Scott’s 70.7 LT GIR percentage is fourth, and his 15.0 LT Adj Bird Avg is eighth. Scott has two top-10 finishes in his last three tournaments, and he is tied for seventh with his 67.9 Recent Adj Rd Score.
555	555	5	5	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only 8 measures rounds, but Rory is gaining 3.125 strokes Off the Tee + Approach per round. That's more than DJ &amp; Spieth COMBINED.
6889	6889	8	8	target: Stricker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since this event moved to Deere Run, Steve Stricker, Zach Johnson, Kenny Perry and Jordan Spieth have won both tournaments and Tim Clark has come close to winning both, finishing runner-up in each event. Sean O'Hair, who won this tournament in 2005, finished tied for second in this year's Dean & Deluca alongside Deere Run specialist, Jordan Spieth, and the 2014 JDC winner, Brian Harman, finished tied for seventh alongside Stricker at this year's Dean & Deluca. Check out Valspar Championship form too as four men have won that tournament as well as this one - the aforementioned Spieth, John Senden, Sean O'Hair and Vijay Singh.
1488	1488	31	32	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A $200,000 increase in his salary seems light and Sean was 28th here 12 months ago and in the top 10 at TPC Summerlin on his last visit to the desert. Adam Hadwin ($7.5m) suits PGA West. I wished he had played in Hawaii, but the Canadian fits this tournament perfectly from a statistics angle and he went out in the final group with Dufner and Lovemark here 12 months ago, finishing 6th.
12175	12175	13	13	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he's converting on the greens, he has us at, "Cheers!" If both Woods and Rose are available to you, they might as well just line up as your picks for the API and the Masters in whichever quinella you prefer. We're treated to the steady contributions of Tommy Fleetwood and Alex Noren again this week, but they'll be there again for us at next week's Match Play where no one will want to square off against either.
1028	1028	7	7	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
1795	1795	22	22	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
2604	2604	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play. At $400 less than Matsuyama, who will likely be more widely owned, the globe-trotting Swede is the play at the new venue.
7329	7329	15	15	target: Stricker- 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's played the Open only twice: T30 two years ago and T12 last year. Steve Stricker- $6,900 (150-1)    Stricker hasn't played the Open Championship much the past few years, but his T4 last year got him invited back. Top-25s at the Open used to be fairly regular for the now 50-year-old, including a T8 at Birkdale in 2008.
9555	9555	17	17	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DeChambeau does the other stuff pretty well. And if you want some odd connection, here it is: DeChambeau got here by winning the John Deere, and this tournament has been won four times by Deere winners in the past seven years: Spieth, Zach Johnson, Steve Stricker and Jonathan Byrd. (No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.)
4887	4887	31	31	target: O'Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I kind of welcome that because I think it would benefit me more for sure." The forecast this week is such that it should separate the men from the boys and O'Hair certainly has the skills to thrive when the trouser legs are flapping. His past course form is patchy but he does have T16 and T18 to his name and T34 last year (ninth after round one) was okay too.
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
962	962	3	4	target: Si WOO 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RSMClassic Card 💰💰💰 Si WOO 66-1 Poston 75-1 Kang 100-1 Mitchell 150-1 Saunders 200-1 **Heavy On the T5 for Si Wo… https://t.co/rBUmrQ5leM
1554	1554	25	25	target: Na's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Na placed third at the CareerBuilder Challenge last season and was 48th in 2015, so there's some course history to examine with him this week. Na's stats also match up well with this course. Although he ranked only 93rd in Par 5 scoring last season, he ranked 2nd in approaches 125-150 yards, 11th in approaches 150-175 yards, and 2nd in SG:App.
4280	4280	30	30	target: Glover’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover ranks 10th in SG: Approach, 14th in SG: Off the Tee, 38th in Par 5 Scoring, and 31st in Birdie or Better %. A boom or bust play, if Glover’s ball striking is on, watch out! Glover is typically priced much lower than this so hopefully that will keep his ownership down.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12033	12033	28	29	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
992	992	0	2	target: B. De Jonge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			B. De Jonge is a sleeper pick this week as he should be low owned and have an outside chance to win the event. I have mentioned Tommy Gainey before, but he has let me down….. so I won’t say anything about him this week.
1013	1013	28	28	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Also like: Kevin Chappell and Charles Howell III. Chappell had a breakout campaign last season and that included a runner-up finish at Sea Island.
7870	7870	27	28	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can. EXPERT ROB BOLTON , Fantasy Columnist LINEUP | BENCH Paul Casey  Rickie Fowler  Dustin Johnson  Brooks Koepka  Hideki Matsuyama  Jon Rahm  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth It’s all about rationing starts right now. So, with no cut at Firestone, there’s no urgency to burn one on Spieth.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
1022	1022	25	26	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season. Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
7121	7121	53	53	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Aussie isn’t having his best season, but has been finding form recently. He’s posted Top 10s in two of his last five starts, and sits inside the Top 20 versus the field in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green, SG: Approach, SG: Off-The-Tee, and in Par 3 efficiency from the key range of 175-200 yards… Grace has never missed a British Open cut, despite a lack of top end results. But his fate will be tied to the weather.
2379	2379	8	8	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Adam Scott ($12,200)  We thought that Scott would be less great without the long putter. Proving that length isn't everything, he leads the Tour in strokes gained, putting.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
1151	1151	0	0	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/5zPyi8BEyX
8444	8444	33	33	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
1200	1200	10	10	target: Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@DFSDiez @FantasyGolfMan Another good one to add to my list. Bozzelli finished 13th on the https://t.co/29SnY9yKZ0… https://t.co/f1oGgjugFD
119	119	46	47	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tournament Skill Averages :  Driving Distance: 32nd, Driving Accuracy: 22nd, Greens in Regulation: 12th, Proximity to Hole: 20th, Scrambling: 30th, Putting Average 27th. So let's take a view from players as to how Bethpage Black played at the 2012 Barclays and what specific skills it requires:  Bubba Watson : "I think it'll be a tough test. Again, that's the only time I've played it, so I don't know if they can firm up the greens.
6881	6881	36	36	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore ranked 34th for DD and 12th for DA. Jordan Spieth, who is missing the tournament for the second year in-a-row, has won two of the last four renewals because he's scrambled and putted brilliantly and Moore ranked first for Scrambling and sixth for Putting Average, but the secret to success here is usually relentlessly finding the putting surfaces. Greens In Regulation is the most important stat but how you play the par fives is key too.
5792	5792	8	8	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Opens. -- Matt Barrie  DraftKings value picks  Matt Kuchar  Kuchar is always a cash game play, especially at this price, but I really love how he's missed only one cut in a U.S. Open and Open Championship in the last six years. Ironically, he also owns only one top-10 in each of those majors during that same time span, so I'd stick with him in cash games and let others fall on the sword in GPPs this week, because he's sure to be chalky.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
7517	7517	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If players can take advantage of the par fives they can see themselves in contention and you can see yourself in contention in DFS Contests. For reference, last year Dustin Johnson came second in the tournament losing by a stroke to Jhonattan Vegas. DJ was -11 for the tournament and played the par fives at -13 with 2 eagles for the week.
12789	12789	33	34	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five of the world's top 10 have already won in 2018, with Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy picking up victories as recently as the Florida Swing. Augusta specialists Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Jason Day arrive with 2 World Golf Championships and a further 2 high-profile PGA Tour victories between them. Another course specialist Jordan Spieth came to life in Houston last week and from a UK perspective Justin Rose, Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton have been playing some great stuff of late.
7645	7645	3	3	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Xander Schauffele at 125/1 Bet365 He shouldn’t be underestimated. Schauffele is a terrific driver of the ball, 19th in driving distance and 30th in strokes gained off the tee and his game reminds me past champion Keegan Bradley.
6979	6979	49	49	target: Charley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With only 15 tags on FanShareSports, he has the third fewest out of anyone priced above $9K. Hoffman’s recent form is incredible, with an 8th place finish at the U.S. Open followed by a T3 at the Travelers. Maybe it only took a couple weeks off to forget what Charley has been up to?
7024	7024	48	48	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event. Barring another withdrawal, which seems very unlikely, Murray should get back right on track at this easy course. As with most players down in this price range this week, Murray isn’t a statistical beast, but he is a good birdie maker, ranking 66th in birdie or better percentage this year.
5897	5897	0	0	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner. Watson made the knockout stages at the Dell Matchplay, played nicely at the Shenzhen International before a final round collapse and then landed 5th at TPC Louisiana with partner J.B. Holmes. But it was at Muirfield Village where Watson really came to the fore for me this week.
964	964	4	4	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hero Chall Picks D Johnson 7s 3pts Win B Koepka 12s 2.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4 [as advised y/day] K Kisner 33s 1.5pts e/w 1/5 1st 4
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
11848	11848	19	19	target: Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament. A justifiable concern.
2184	2184	25	25	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott will likely be my one-and-done pick this week as he has gone T-2, T-10 and T-17 in last three tries at Riviera. If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk.
708	708	14	15	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The most complete performances are rewarded with the most points. My roster  Fearsome foursome  Matt Kuchar  Emiliano Grillo  Jon Rahm  Kevin Na  Bench mob  Patrick Rodgers  Brendan Steele  Alternatives  Paul Casey  Justin Thomas  Grayson Murray  Kyle Reifers  Hudson Swafford  Harris English  • • •  Fore! Head to Golfweek.com for my entire archive as history never gets historical!
7110	7110	12	12	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m thinking the odds are in his favor. Sergio Garcia… Much like Fowler, he’s elite when it comes to playing in the elements. It’s no wonder he’s pieced together 10 top 10s in 20 Open Championship appearances.
726	726	60	61	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's really all you need to know as far as analysis on him as he's been good outside of the US for the past two years, has posted back to back sixth-place finishes in Euro Tour events and has three top 10s in his last four appearances here -- translation: he's a great value play this week. Jeff Bergerson -- Bubba Watson ($8,800)  With another no-cut event this week for the WGC HSBC, I will be targeting guys who can rack up Draftkings points. Not many are better at that than Bubba Watson.
11670	11670	7	7	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The result is a newer slimline, healthy Moore has emerged on tour in 2018, which he says is geared towards getting the maximum out of his game over the next 5yrs of his career up till he turns 40. I really do feel we are yet to see the best of Moore and I don’t rule out this former stellar amateur delivering a major championship one day. In the shorter term though I feel a big week could be in the offing for him at the Valspar.
1760	1760	46	46	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
4234	4234	46	47	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ben Martin has local ties and a win at Victoria National to his name, while Jonathan Randolph has twice been runner-up at the latter and arrives on the back of a couple of positive performances in Puerto Rico and Texas. However, last on my list is Patrick Reed, who is big enough to chance at 55/1. Reed has endured a pretty miserable spring, but he sounded bullish in the run-up to the Texas Open and started brightly there, before stumbling at the end of the first round and somehow missing the cut after a poor second.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
6720	6720	15	16	target: Brian Harman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2015 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 101st, Round 2: 16th, Round 3: 1st. 2014 - Brian Harman: Round 1: 1st, Round 2: 3rd, Round 3: 1st. 2013 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 64th, Round 2: 19th, Round 3: 9th.
116	116	19	19	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
12215	12215	104	105	target: Patrick Reed. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
12576	12576	23	24	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best part about all of this is that he is priced right below Luke List who will soak up a ton of ownership. Matt Kuchar – $9,100  Kuch hasn’t been Mr.Reliable lately, failing to record a top 25 in his past four events, with the other three falling outside the top 40. He was heavily owned in Mexico where he came a disappointing T58.
4174	4174	12	12	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bar a lack of course experience, negatives begin and end with putting. Grace was very poor on the greens for much of last week’s Valero Texas Open and Oosthuizen was baffled by Augusta’s lightning surfaces, but this course has always been more about ball-striking (hence a list of poor-putting winners) and on that front perhaps only Stenson and Rose can be labelled superior to this pair. The Europeans are respected, but Stenson has gone right off the boil and Rose will be teeing it up for the first time since a heartbreaking Augusta defeat.
10026	10026	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer. And I say that as a good thing.
858	858	15	15	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - @THEPLAYERSChamp 2.5ew Garcia 18-1; 1ew Thomas 35-1, Matsuyama 25-1; 0.5ew Chappell 60-1, Fowler 22-1, Scott 45-1
10733	10733	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk. Kirk is always a solid putter and relies on his irons, so take some GPP shares of Kirk this week.
3262	3262	17	18	target: Jamie Lovemark 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll roster again this week. Jhonattan Vegas $7,300  Kyle Stanley $7,400  JT Poston $6,600  Hudson Swafford $8,000  Jamie Lovemark $6,800  Ollie Schneiderjans $6,700  I’ve listed the guys above in order that I like them. It should be a very fun week and an important week to watch as much golf as possible so you have a better idea of who is playing well going into next week.
565	565	1	1	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed Kaymer at 185/1. Poor record here, but playing well and likes the big event. Weather could produce a surprise winner like ZJ in 2007.
1493	1493	0	0	target: Steele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt better than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/VxSS9o43Ze
2199	2199	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he loves Riviera, with six top 10s in nine starts. Also like: Hideki Matsuyama. Got a little rest after Phoenix, and how can continue his hot ways on a layout where he has had some nice success.
12100	12100	41	41	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large. Arnold Palmer Invitational Interactive Data  Note these tools are FREE each week for Pro Members.
13198	13198	9	9	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
758	758	15	15	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Walker also played poorly at East Lake which again is a factor. Before that though, Walker had finished T13 at the BMW Championship and 3rd at the Deutsche Bank Championship. The odds are stacked against him but no more so than they were at the PGA Championship and look how well he played that week.
2756	2756	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
12459	12459	1	1	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form. He showed signs of that in his last start, posting a top 10 at the Valspar.
11427	11427	28	28	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s due for a breakout on the North American stage, and perhaps a trip to Mexico is all he needs to get the monkey off his back. Alex Noren – $8,800  Noren was priced $10,100 last week and came third, so obviously his price had to drop $1,300. Noren is playing incredible as of late, getting his feet real wet on North American soil.
9766	9766	21	22	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Weather Forecast    TV Coverage  Live on Sky Sports all four days, beginning at midnight on Thursday. Last Five Winners  2017 - Justin Thomas -27  2016 - Fabian Gomez -20 (playoff)  2015 - Jimmy Walker -23  2014 - Jimmy Walker -17  2013 - Russell Henley -24    What Will it Take to Win the Sony Open? What you do off the tee at Waialae is almost irrelevant.
4850	4850	32	33	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			'Rahmbo' for me is a future World Number 1 who in all likelihood can win on any course, however 12/1 on a specialised track where experience pays like Colonial holds little appeal. Jason Dufner will be well-backed this week and is the first up for me. Tough, windy conditions will play to his strengths, as will fast conditions if they come into play.
842	842	10	10	target: KOEPKA 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
714	714	11	11	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Valero Texas Open - 2ew Chappell 33/1, 2ew Koepka 25/1; 1ew List 50/1
1048	1048	3	3	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm touting Wes Bryan Come hang in my @PowerHourDFS slack https://t.co/JYS9wono32
5941	5941	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect a thrilling finish and bounce backs from McIlroy and Day, who both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Russell Knox  2015 – Bubba Watson  2014 – Kevin Streelman  2013 – Ken Duke  2012 – Marc Leishman  2011 – Fredrik Jacobsen  2010 – Bubba Watson  2009 – Kenny Perry  2008 – Stewart Cink  2007 – Hunter Mahan    Key Stats to Winning at TPC River Highlands    • Par Breakers percentage  • Par 4 scoring average  • Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green    Champion's Profile    With an interesting list of both short and long hitters claiming victories in the past, it is clear length has little to do with winning on one of the PGA Tour’s shortest courses. Plenty of shorter holes means birdies can come in bunches and are essential to success here, so look for players with high par-breaker percentages as quality candidates.
7176	7176	30	30	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is always hard to predict ownership in Majors because there are so many possible ways in which a line-up can be constructed. However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense.
10622	10622	22	23	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a great venue for him to keep his hot play going and I'm happy to get involved at 35/1. Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price.
1209	1209	12	13	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Career Builder Challenge Webb Simpson 20/1 Chesson Hadley 50/1 JJ Spaun 65/1 David Lingmerth 66/1 Scott Piercy 80/1… https://t.co/pWakq5RrXy
548	548	8	9	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Dustin Johnson  Vegas Odds - 9/1  Draftkings - $11,300  FantasyAces - $6,100  DJ is starting to trend in the right direction after an 18th at the Barlays and a T8 last week at the Deutsche Bank Championship. His finish could have been better or worse depending on how you look it.
11437	11437	13	14	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Dustin Johnson – $11,900  Boring I know, but whenever DJ is in the field playing at a course he has won at before, it’s so tough not to load up. There is only so much that can be said about DJ before it becomes copy and paste from the week prior.
539	539	2	2	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
1846	1846	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here.
3590	3590	22	23	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think he has a legitimate shot to win this tournament if he keeps the ball near the hole on his approaches. Daniel Berger is coming off a solid week at the Shell Open and looks to continue his fine play at the Masters. Berge is a solid player in every category, but does a great job on the green which should help him have a strong run at Augusta.
13552	13552	22	22	target: Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I don't think he's a bad play here but I have two other options I like. That leaves me with Steele and Hoffman. Hoffman grades out better in total course history, current form, and is only slightly worse in long-term performance.
2621	2621	10	10	target: Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nobody hits a 3-wood with more confidence and accuracy than Stenson. Stenson ranks 7th in Driving Accuracy and 5th in GIR on the European Tour making him a scoring machine with a Stroke Average of just over 68. Value Pick: I’m going with Jon Rahm as my value pick at +3,000.
3574	3574	9	9	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Factor in driving, and he's 54th in ball striking. Dufner missed the cut two of the past three years, but he's a better golfer now. He notched top-25s in 2012 and '13.
2102	2102	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
10025	10025	2	2	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
1587	1587	8	8	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Qatar Masters: Smith @55s - 1.65pts e/w #hondaclassic: Kirk @100s - 0.95pts e/w (8 places with Sky)
10544	10544	25	25	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident. As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh.
10204	10204	35	36	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas scares me in cash games, but I totally understand the play if you want to use him in those, as well. -- Taras Pitra  Editor's Picks Weekly 18: Rory McIlroy came back strong, will Tiger Woods do so, too? Tommy Fleetwood got the victory in Abu Dhabi, but Rory McIlroy's impressive showing there could signal he's ready for a big comeback year.
386	386	5	5	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here. Everything is trending in the right direction for Day. Jordan Spieth  Vegas Odds - 12/1  Draftkings - $11,600  FantasyAces - $6,000    Spieth is starting to heat up and is on the brink of winning once again.
3813	3813	36	37	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Morgan Hoffmann ($7,000): With local ties to the area and a recent career-best at the Honda Classic, Hoffmann has a lot of potential but I'm keeping on the front end since he's not the safest option. Jason Dufner ($8,300): Is playing steady golf this season. He's been inside the top 30 thru 36 holes in 9 of his last 10 starts, so you know where I'll be placing him this week.
934	934	1	2	target: Harris English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Harris English -- English is a former winner here in 2013, and he was T-4 in Vegas, and he's a cut-making machine. Usually good for plenty of points, but hard to recommend for a win.
950	950	15	15	target: Laird, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not walking out on any thin-limbs this week, but 7k guys I prefer: Streelman, Cink, Laird, Cook, &amp; Tway Will be h… https://t.co/7L4lUOsO9J
439	439	3	4	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
1650	1650	5	5	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However we do know that Walker comes to the fore on classical layouts and that he loves Poa Annua greens. Walker, like Woods and Snedeker before him, is a natural putter and that works well on these greens. Since 2012, Walker's record at Torrey Pines reads 8th, 4th, MC, 7th and 4th.
12507	12507	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Be aggressive. Phil Mickelson: "The style of play here is totally different than Augusta. The rope is at 300 yards or so off the tee, everything pitches in here and every tee shot has a hazard in play.
3806	3806	31	32	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Could be the recipe for success this week. Mori Yoshimoto  @Bears3423    Last Week: 348.5 points  Last Week Rank: 5,177    Kevin Na ($29,500)  William McGirt ($29,000)  Lucas Glover ($15,700)  Kyle Stanley ($12,200)  Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)  John Peterson ($4,300)    ANALYSIS: Ball-striking is the name of the game here for Mo. If Valspar proves to be a worthy pointer like it often does than Cantlay's runner-up finish there looks even better.
983	983	3	3	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My man A. Cook may be worth a bit as well.
13019	13019	20	21	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finally Riviera is intrinsic with Casey, Holmes, Pieters, Schwartzel and Westwood all having top 5 finishes at Hogan's Alley. So Patrick Cantlay ticks many of those course links very nicely. 9th at Pebble Beach (2013) came when Patrick had just turned pro.
12039	12039	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Jason Day, $12500 – Day enters rested after a win and runner-up his last two starts on TOUR. He paces the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and is plenty long enough to score on the par-5s this week.
12928	12928	14	14	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley has progressive Masters form of MC-31-21-11 and was T8 in Houston last week. Johnson is a former Green Jacket winner (also T9 in 2015) whose game doesn't look far away after T26 at Bay Hill and T16 in the Valspar. Hadwin has strokeplay form of 6-9-12 and was a creditable T36 on his Masters debut last year.
6589	6589	21	21	target: List. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tight with tough to hit greens and penalizing areas around the green. That is not the ideal course set up for List. However, Old White TPC course is.
6003	6003	1	2	target: David Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. David Lingmerth, $7,900  After a poor start to the season, Lingmerth has found the form that made the 29-year-old one of the game’s most interesting prospects in 2015-16. The Swede has four top-21 finishes in his last five events, smashing salary-based expectation each time.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
2117	2117	20	20	target: Laird’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
5980	5980	7	7	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
4233	4233	19	20	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smylie Kaufman at 500/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - speculative but better on last solo start and may surprise  1pt e.w. Patrick Reed at 55/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - good signs in last two starts and more prolific than most of these  Owing to the fact that regular venue Quail Hollow will host this year's PGA Championship, Eagle Point, on the North Carolina coast, steps in to ensure the Wells Fargo can go ahead as scheduled. Like Quail Hollow, this Tom Fazio design is a relatively meaty par 72 and while seldom do players and officials criticise a venue, the praise for this one has been stronger than usual.
4863	4863	47	48	target: Jason Dufner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Amazingly Jon Rahm heads the betting, which is a measure of his meteoric rise along with the lack of strength in depth in the field. The Spaniard is a class act but I think the title might be heading to another elite ball-striker in the shape of Jason Dufner. Twice a runner-up at Colonial he finished T6 last year and it’s clearly a course he gets on well with.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
11856	11856	28	28	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his career success at Heritage hasn’t translated to Valspar yet, the South African’s knack for smacking quality irons and saving himself around the greens should translate perfectly. Grace lost strokes on his approaches in Mexico for the first time all season, yet he continued his season-long trend of saving pars from missed GIRs. If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa.
5594	5594	21	22	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, if the wind begins howling, leaning towards some of the links-experienced international players will pay dividends. Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose & Jamie Lovemark – Outside of driving distance (139th), there’s nary a category Kisner isn’t dominating this year. It’s led to a win, a silver medal, and seven Top 15s in 13 starts.
3823	3823	4	4	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			16. Other than that, Kuchar has been surprisingly off this year with a T-9 in Phoenix being his only other top 10. Considering he has a win, a fifth and a T-9 at Harbour Town, he's the safest bet for a big week here.
5747	5747	3	3	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts. With his mother’s health improved and his own health no longer an issue, Day seems to be playing much freer of late and for that reason alone I’d not be shocked at all if he put it all together here and won his second major.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
5881	5881	22	23	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finishing position in brackets:  2016: Russell Knox -10 (Winner); Jerry Kelly (2nd) Shawn Stefani (11th) -9; Tyrone Van Aswegen (5th) -8. 2015: Bubba Watson -12 (Winner); Bo Van Pelt (7th) -10; Paul Casey (2nd) -9; Curran (10th), Delaet (4th), Gore (10th), Harman (3rd), Pettersson (5th) -8. 2014: Kevin Streelman (Winner), Brandt Snedeker (11th) -11; K.J.
2202	2202	24	25	target: Hideki Matsuyama, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
5837	5837	8	9	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s break down the field! The Favorites…  Rickie Fowler – Player with the most balanced bag in the field goes right back to the top after missing the cut in Memphis. Fowler checks in #2 SG: Total highlighted by his excellent putting and short game.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
4150	4150	21	22	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
11831	11831	71	72	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's had a bit of a break and just turned 40 and I just wonder if that significant milestone might inject a bit of impetuous. He's a risky play but at a triple-figure price he's well worth the risk and last but not least, I've thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned John Deere Classic winner, Bryson DeChambeau. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [25.0]  Jason Dufner @ [85.0]  Ollie Schniederjans @ [95.0]  Zach Johnson @ [110.0]  Bryson DeChambeau @ [130.0]  I'll be back later with the Hero Indian Open preview.
12071	12071	1	2	target: Bradley/Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth. They’re generating beaucoup birdie tries, and that’s what you want at Bay Hill.
1168	1168	2	3	target: Dominic Bozzelli 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like Dominic Bozzelli at the Career Builder at a price. 5th here last year. Top 40 last week at Sony closing 6… https://t.co/a40lM7Lyp1
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
896	896	4	5	target: Charley Hoffman. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So you never know. Charley Hoffman. OK, his form coming in is troublesome to say the least (he’s missed his first two cuts of the 2016-17 PGA Tour season).
6271	6271	26	26	target: Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			One angle that will be played up this week is that the web.com Tour hosted events here in 2012 and 2013. One of the winners, David Lingmerth, is in this field and gaining steam in the industry. Not only is Lingmerth in great form, but clearly he’ll have positive memories to draw upon.
5673	5673	21	22	target: Russell Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This market is deep and I'm happy to leave it alone. There are only three in the Top Scot market - Russell Knox, Martin Laird and Richie Ramsay and I'm more than happy to take the 11/8 about Knox. Ramsay's home course is Royal Aberdeen so he might take to Erin Hills but he's not in great form and nor is Laird.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
13166	13166	54	55	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dave Tindall previews the event and picks out his three best bets...  "The man who once shot 60 on the PGA Tour when still an amateur was a classy tied fourth at the Genesis Open in February and probably just needs the right course again." Each-way terms: 1/5 odds, 7 places  Main Bet: Back Patrick Cantlay e.w. @ 33/1  It can be hard to muster enthusiasm for golf after the high of Masters week but, for some reason, the RBC Heritage at Harbour Town Golf Links has been one of my most profitable events on the PGA Tour down the years.
330	330	6	6	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
4299	4299	11	11	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'll keep the local theme going with a punt on Bill Haas at 33/1. Haas has huge connections with the Carolinas. He was born in Charlotte, NC, went to college at Wake Forest (NC) and now lives in Greenville (SC).
13091	13091	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t putt. The last time Scott gained strokes on the green was at the WGC Bridgestone last July. Not great, Bob.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
600	600	11	11	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Would be nice if I could see if I can fit Dufner Perez Kisner in every lineup this week.
4568	4568	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It sure looks like it. According to FanShareSports.com, Day is the 29th most tagged golfer so far this week and is the only golfer above $9K with single digit tags. In a week where there will be a ton of fresh faces to DFS golf due to the increase in contest sizes, Day makes for a fantastic GPP play.
4240	4240	40	40	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Masters link might be worth exploring, though. Marsh Benson, formerly the senior course director at Augusta before retiring, was brought in as a consultant on this project and that, combined with those Augusta mentions, is enough to support Bill Haas at 40/1. Haas might be another who relishes the move away from Quail Hollow, even if he perhaps wouldn't admit it, because his record there had grown stale.
5172	5172	26	26	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year. Scott ranks 26th in SG:T2G, 14th in BoB%, 33rd in GIR%, and 37th in Par 4 Scoring. His game is trending in the right direction and hop on the train before it’s too late.
158	158	11	11	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Steve Palmer - Racing Post - SBS Tournament of Champions 4ew Spieth 11/2, 3ew D Johnson 11/2 #SBSTournamentofChampions
7556	7556	24	24	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He does not have much for tournament history, but his $7,900 seems really reasonable considering the strength of this field. -- Jeff Bergerson  Patrick Cantlay  There's a lot to like statistically from the top of the price board on DraftKings this week, but with the bulk of the stars coming back from across the pond at The Open, Cantlay offers a lot of the same upside at a much cheaper price. Fair warning -- he will be highly-owned as the Twitter darling of DFS, but making him the cornerstone of a lineup still allows a lot of room for a higher-priced golfer, or the ability to differentiate by going for more balanced approach.
1339	1339	6	6	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Apologies. Prices should read Webb 45 English 55 Hadwin 66 Steele 66 1/4 1-6 Will be amended tonight. Lipsky was… https://t.co/fuvSF8BewH
1190	1190	9	10	target: Ryan Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It ain't flashy, but if you're into correlated events, Ryan Palmer may very well be a solid punt. Medical exemption… https://t.co/wGOxtyxkld
11205	11205	30	30	target: Garcia's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago. The week before, he won the Singapore Open.
198	198	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having played well (T13 US PGA) on A.W. Tillinghast's Baltusrol, I'm taking Reed to really thrive on another of the great designer's east coast tracks. Snap up the 50/1.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
13198	13198	9	9	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
417	417	42	43	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			South America: Emiliano Grillo – The Argentine is on a lovely run of form as he looks set to clinch the Rookie of the Year award on the PGA Tour. He finished in a tie for second last week, just one behind Patrick Reed, and also tied for 13th and 8th at the USPGA and Olympics. He’s up to sixth in the FedEx Cup and up to a career-high 25th in the world.
11347	11347	20	21	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It certainly helped that he got some favorable ruling in terms of finding sprinkler heads in the middle of nowhere. Tony Finau  He ranks just 112th in strokes gained putting but I think that's a bit misleading. Since switching his putting grip back at the Playoffs last year, he has gained strokes putting in 6-of-8 events with ShotLink.
517	517	22	22	target: Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FRO - Jeremy Chapman - Houston Open - 1.5pt ew Henley 40-1, Stenson 14-1; 1ew Mickelson 22-1, 0.5pt ew Westwood 100-1, K Bradley 70-1
7177	7177	7	7	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
3625	3625	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson ($11,300)  So far, the Masters is the weakest major on his resume, but the course is built for a bomber like DJ, who should overpower the par 5s like Tiger in his prime. And that's who Johnson most resembles right now after winning his last three starts. (UPDATE: DUSTIN JOHNSON IS OUT!
1852	1852	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is the perfect chance for Reed to kick-start his year, as he prepares for the first major of the season – The Masters in April. His course form was a big factor into picking him this week and generally speaking 33/1 is a big price for a player of Reed’s calibre, especially at a course he tends to play well at. Matt Jones 125/1 (Bet365, Betfred, StanJames) 0.5pt e/w:  Matt Jones no longer has a PGA Tour card, so he will be relying on good performances in his limited starts.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
324	324	33	33	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statswise he ranks first in both SGTTG and SG approaches to the green, 16th in GIR and 14th in par 4 scoring. After a great performance last week and a good record here, Scott could be one to watch here this week. Brandt Snedeker 50/1  Ive decided to give Sneds another shot here at TPC Boston this week.
5604	5604	27	27	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Opens have produced the following winners, in order. Angel Cabrera    Tiger Woods    Lucas Glover    Graeme McDowell    Rory McIlroy    Webb Simpson    Justin Rose    Martin Kaymer    Jordan Spieth    Dustin Johnson    Only Spieth and Woods will be remembered on this list as being all-time great putters, and Tiger is probably the best ball-striker ever (and Spieth the most underrated of his generation). Looking back at Oakmont last year, Johnson was No.
309	309	27	27	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
1623	1623	17	17	target: Tommy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 adds just now over at sportsbook: Knox 50 Ollie 60 Kizzire 60 They join from yesterday: Tommy 30, Harman 35, Billy Ho 100
9978	9978	20	21	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It checks out statistically(via FNGC) as well as you can see below over his last four rounds on the course. Austin Cook  World Golf Ranking (#118)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($8,700)  FanDuel ($9,800)  I wrote about him last week in the stats section and have upgraded him to the form section this week as he has now made all six cuts in his rookie season including a win at the RSM Classic. From a fantasy perspective, he has been very consistent with 70 or more DraftKings points in five of those six tournaments and is now averaging 84.4 on the season.
552	552	21	21	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Houston - 2ew Reed 45/1, 2ew Finau 45/1, Henley 2ew 35/1; 1ew Hoffman 55/1; 0.5ew List 100/1
3485	3485	46	46	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am more than happy to overlook the finish last week, purely because I see last week as a tune-up for Phil, rather than him going for the win. Despite not having a single win since his Scottish Open/Open Championship double back in 2013, I think Mickelson still has plenty left in the tank. His efforts at the 2016 Open Championship, where he went toe-to-toe with Henrik Stenson on the final day, enough evidence for me.
5966	5966	25	26	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But enough rambling; here's what the Professor has to say for the 2017 Travelers Championship. Pinterest Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth Jason Day Rory McIlroy Brandt Snedeker Justin Thomas Tony Finau Patrick Reed Webb Simpson Paul Casey Kevin Na  Professor's Explanation : The top three picks come out strong (in the event) almost every time. Their “long term” stats are so good, they get strong results on almost any course.
880	880	27	28	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He putted well last week when finishing tied for 23rd and I thought he was worth another chance at a huge price. Selections:  Jon Rahm @ [29.0]  Jimmy Walker @ [50.0]  Ryan Blaum @ [160.0]  Ben Crane @ [200.0]    I'll be back with the In-Play Blog on Thursday or Friday. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
3971	3971	39	39	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm putting more faith in his talent (currently world number 24), recent momentum and ability to win in all parts of the world and in different conditions (Japan 2016, Phoenix, USA 2015, Turkey 2014, Scotland 2013, Spain 2012). Ryan Moore and Adam Hadwin were others who caught my eye. Moore had an excellent Masters until falling away on Sunday to finish T9.
12209	12209	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood - $15,900    Fleetwood could’ve cruised away with a victory during his API debut last year if it weren’t for a first-round 78, as he played his final three rounds in a combined 12-under-par to salvage a top-10 finish while champion Marc Leishman won with an overall score of 11-under. Fleetwood has finished T14 or better in six of his last seven starts, while he’s also second on Tour in SG: T2G. The Englishman has yet to win on American soil, but this could be the week Fleetwood proves himself worthy of a top-10 spot in the OWGR.
10891	10891	28	28	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats show that he's finished second and first in Scrambling for the last two weeks. He's also putting well (3rd SG Putting Phoenix, 19th SGP Pebble) although Mickelson being Mickelson he still can't hide his obsession with driving distance. "I've really had to increase speed to hang with a lot of the younger guys," he said at Pebble.
381	381	22	23	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I also believe he will once again come in much lower owned than Day and Johnson making him an elite GPP play. Adam Scott  Vegas Odds - 21/1  Draftkings - $10,400  FantasyAces - $5,750  He continued his impressive season this past week at the Barclay's with a T4, his 6th Top 10 of the year. He doesn't seem to get mentioned as much as the five players ahead of him and this could be to our benefit this week.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
4133	4133	25	26	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele will likely be the highest owned golfer on the slate, but I am willing to put him in 60%-70% of my lineups this week. Tony Finau – $8,400  It’s a bombers week, so Tony Finau has to be considered especially at his reasonable $8,400 price tag. Finau has been playing solid this season with two top 5s in his last seven events.
3666	3666	24	24	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He shot 70 on Sunday to save face and ensure another decent, if unspectacular week at the Masters. After starting so brightly last week, Fitzpatrick will naturally be disappointed with his 32nd place finish at Augusta, but he can put that all behind him with a win here. His 2017 highlights include a T5 finish in Dubai, a T16 in the WGC-Mexico and a T13 at Bay Hill, so he has definitely shown flashes of form since the turn of the year.
5778	5778	31	32	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory McIlroy (8): Starts in the opposite wave as DJ, and there is no concerns with wasting starts since Rory has been sidelined for so long. =SUPER SUBS =  Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott      Group B    Jordan Spieth (3): Has won a U.S. Open already and has some experience at Erin Hills (2011 U.S. Amateur).
5471	5471	7	7	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Or almost anything but a golf movie. Fowler is a great feel-good pick. I can't top that one.
3269	3269	7	7	target: Taylor's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He even won an event last year. Taylor's forte has always been putting and he's a former runner-up of this event, back in 2010. In a further signal that this is his sort of test, Taylor also contended for 54 holes in the 2007 Masters en route to an excellent top-ten finish.
13195	13195	0	1	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
194	194	2	2	target: @BHaasGolf 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Gone with @BHaasGolf at 22/1 in the #careerbuilderchallenge. Hard to knock the strong claims of the two-time tournament winner Haas
5535	5535	47	47	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 37th in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee which is vital this week, but more impressive is how he ranks in Strokes Gained: Approach-the-Green (9th), Stroked Gained: Tee-to-Green (9th) and Stroked Gained: Putting (23rd). Add to this his ranking of 38th in Stroked Gained: Around-the-Green and Kisner ranks an impressive 5th in Strokes Gained: Total. Kisner also ranks 12th in Driving Accuracy, but ranking just 132nd in Driving Distance (286.4 yards) meant his Total Driving ranking couldn’t be any better than 32nd.
6580	6580	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That will leave someone like Patrick Reed to go under owned. Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls. People are moving off of Reed at a point in the season he is playing his best golf.
10586	10586	10	10	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hawkins fits the bill. Playing for the third consecutive week, Harkins has reeled off three straight top 25s with a T12 and T8 the past two weeks, and he’s been doing it scoring on par 5s and long par 4s. Over the past 12 rounds, he sits 11th and third respectively.
1624	1624	19	19	target: Lowry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			A player capable of playing in bad conditions is always good to have on side and with Snedeker and Lowry we have two. What also appeals about Lowry is his course history. He’s played here on two occasions, finishing 7th on debut in 2015 and 13th here last year.
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
6531	6531	35	35	target: Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (DK: $7,800, FD: $8,100)    Walker is a guy that I like to target anytime where approach shots will be at a premium. He sometimes sprays if off of the tee, but similar to Holmes, the wide fairways should help mask some of those problems. Walker has been struggling will illness this year and is coming off of two straight missed cuts, but he is a good enough long-term golfer where you have to believe a rebound is coming.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2044	2044	32	32	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He sprays it off the tee without much distance, and the best part of his game is his scrambling and putting. Webb Simpson ($8,200)  Simpson is perhaps a perfect pivot off of Reed at this price because statistically he’s exactly what you’re looking for here. His approach game- especially out of the rough- is top tier and his entire tee to green game is solid.
1247	1247	1	1	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
7324	7324	18	19	target: Padraig Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens. The only score close is Mark O'Meara's even-par in 1998, also weather-induced.
11	11	4	4	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bob Harig - Henrik Stenson ($9,500)  The Swede has been lurking under the radar since his last victory at the 2014 DP World Tour Championship on the European Tour, but manages to contend often. Ranked sixth in the world, Stenson won the Players Championship in 2009. Michael Collins - Sergio Garcia ($9,900)  He hasn't missed a cut at this event since 2003!
1988	1988	21	22	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This could bite me in the ass, but I am 100% off Rahmbo this week. Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Jimmy Walker  World Golf Ranking (23rd)  Vegas Odds (30/1)  Draftkings ($8,800)      First of all, this pick is for GPP's only! I will make that clear right from the get go.
6390	6390	8	9	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Greenbrier  1. Patrick Reed  2. Bill Haas  3.
12606	12606	21	21	target: Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Coming off the missed cut at the API mixed with less than stellar course history could lead to lower ownership. Nick Watney $6,800 – I think this price is about $500 too low, so I will take advantage of the savings. Tom Lovelady $7,400 – Never played here but has finished top 20 in 2 of his last 3 starts.
2058	2058	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks in the top 20 of our TFF projections and is one of the top players under $8,000. Other Players to Consider: Dustin Johnson ($11,800), Chris Kirk ($7,500), Matt Jones ($7,000), Brian Gay ($6,700)  Player projections, stats models, DFS lineup builders and much more!

9143	9143	0	0	target: Patton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patton has undoubtedly struggled with his game throughout 2017, but green shoots have been visible of late. A dangerous scorer, Kizzire hit the PGA Tour in 2015/16 with a bang. 2 wins and a further 10 top-10s on the 2015 web.com Tour marked him out as a talent of high regard.
236	236	19	19	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He loves the challenge of a difficult golf course and I could easily see him taking home this title. Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 33/1  Draftkings - $9,100  FantasyAces - $5,650  Bubba checks every box for me this week. He is coming off an 8th place finish at the Olympics and if there was anyone who seemed to embrace the experience 100% it was definitely Bubba.
1065	1065	13	13	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
257	257	3	3	target: Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Casey, An &amp; Molinari in Genesis Open this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
7391	7391	10	11	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Matt Kuchar ($11,400) – It’s never fun paying this much for Kuchar at any event in my mind, but at this event, he’s definitely earned it. Kuchar has finished inside the top ten in his last three appearances at this course, and he’s now coming off of four top ten finishes in his last six starts.
1707	1707	31	31	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Any other year he would have won the Open Championship with his performance at Royal Troon, but Henrik Stenson was just too good. In addition to his 2nd place that week, Mickelson also finished runner-up at Pebble Beach and the FedEx St Jude Classic. Three further top-4 finishes at the CareerBuilder, WGC Cadillac and the Wells Fargo were enough to ensure a very solid year.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
421	421	11	11	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Bets out early this week! Arnold Palmer Bets: Outright: Rose E/W: Kisner McDowell Perez FRL: Saunders
853	853	16	16	target: Rory/Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Just getting around to listen. Looks like @NYCPunter and I are both gonna be riding the Rory/Hideki train... https://t.co/drnZAVEJBz
1006	1006	5	6	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whee Kim - $7,400  5. Stewart Cink - $6,900  6. Ryan Brehm - $6,500  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
571	571	2	2	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			9. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar went to Georgia Tech and he plays pretty well in this college hometown event. However, his form has slipped in the playoffs.
13112	13112	40	41	target: Si Woo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time. The thing that makes these two finishes of particular interest to me is that when Si Woo has won his two PGA tour titles to date he hasn’t come in to the events on a blinding run of form, but has actually won events following steady 25th & 22nd place finishes. So in summary we have a world class proven winner, on a perfect track for his game rounding in to steady form.
732	732	3	3	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			OAD will be Grace or Steele im still undecided
1315	1315	2	3	target: Harris English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Oh god Harris English was T8 and T11 the last two weeks and has two top 10's in Scottsdale. https://t.co/Lhekanxodh
13196	13196	22	22	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again though, this isn’t a course you’d expect him to compete at, and his form at other events is far more intriguing. Cook won the RSM Classic, finished T18 at the Sony Open and also made the weekend at the Mayakoba (T50) after shooting an opening-round 66. All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game.
6301	6301	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also, look for me on Twitter (@DFSBenj), where I'll be providing much more PGA and MLB daily fantasy content. Key Stats:  Strokes Gained Approach  Scrambling  Ball Striking  Par 4 Scoring  Driving Accuracy  Quicken Loans National Picks (Daily Fantasy Golf)  Top-Tier Studs:  Patrick Reed (DK: $11,100, FD: $9,800)  I expect most will go with Rickie Fowler in this spot, but for GPPs I’m leaning toward Reed. He has been trending up for the past month or so, and it feels like a win is coming for him.
7495	7495	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No. 1 in your lineup, but DJ has two runner-up finishes at Glen Abbey.
3596	3596	31	31	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years. He will look to dominate the competition with his strong iron play.
168	168	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To steal a line from Samuel L. Jackson in the first Jurassic Park, "Hold on to your butts." Jonathan Coachman -- Jason Day ($12,400)  Bethpage Black is a "big boys" golf course. There are a lot of holes that have long carries and long approach shots.
7624	7624	54	55	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This isn’t incredibly groundbreaking information, but you’ll want to roster golfers who can take advantage of the short Par 5s and who are in good recent form in terms of accuracy. The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively.
12106	12106	13	13	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Tiger Woods – $10,000  Personal note – I have been only writing about fantasy golf for a couple of years now, and never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d have the chance to consider Tiger Woods as the strongest play in an event. When Tiger first came back last year, he was an auto fade.
8446	8446	39	39	target: Jason 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			27th at the Open Championship, 24th at the Bridgestone Invitational and 9th at the PGA Championship - a position which would have been closer to a tie for 5th without his ill-judged 'snowman' on the 18th on Saturday - Jason is undoubtedly warming to the cause. Day thrives in the north-east of America as 5th at Ridgewood (2010), 2nd at TPC Boston (2010), 3rd at TPC Boston (2011), 8th at Oak Hill (2013), 2nd at Ridgewood (2014), 7th at TPC Boston (2014), 1st at Plainfield (2015), 2nd at Baltusrol (2016) and 4th at Bethpage Black (2016) when defending his Barclays title 12 months ago ably highlights. But there are a couple of other reasons why I like the World Number 9 this week.
2706	2706	0	1	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
1587	1587	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (DK $9,400) was the chalk trap at Sony and you can bet he’ll be low owned after burning a bunch of your opponents money. Walker’s success here is weird considering how difficult it is to hit fairways, but I’m not going to argue with results and getting him at a lower ownership this week will be a perk. Fire up West Coast Jimmy.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
9725	9725	3	3	target: Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
2127	2127	47	48	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Tommy Fleetwood; 2) C.T. Pan / Kevin Streelman; 4) Jordan Spieth; 5) Daniel Berger; 6) Martin Kaymer / Francesco Molinari; 8) Alex Noren; 9) Charl Schwartzel; 10) Keegan Bradley; 11) Patrick Cantlay / Peter Uihlein; 13) Billy Horschel; 14) Branden Grace; 15) Dustin Johnson / Pat Perez / J.J. Spaun; 18) Brendan Steele; 19) Kyle Stanley; 20) Justin Thomas. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Dustin Johnson; 2) Justin Thomas; 3) Daniel Berger; 4) Matt Kuchar / Phil Mickelson; 6) James Hahn; 7) Padraig Harrington; 8) Marc Leishman; 9) Chris Stroud; 10) Brian Gay; 11) Tommy Fleetwood; 12) Cameron Smith; 13) Alex Noren; 14) Dominic Bozzelli / Si Woo Kim; 16) Retief Goosen; 17) Rafa Cabrera-Bello / Peter Malnati; 19) Wesley Bryan / J.B. Holmes.
11199	11199	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Saunders is ranked 33rd on Tour in strokes gained total. Luke Donald - $7,000 (150-1)  There aren't many tracks to take Donald anymore. This is one of them.
1255	1255	4	4	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that. He was eighth on tour in scrambling last season.
11971	11971	9	9	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this point, you are purely betting on whether Scott can putt even just respectably for four rounds, which at 40/1 I am happy to chance that he will. When 3rd here in 2014, Scott ranked 14th in SG: Putting, and that will be the sort of ranking he will need to achieve this week. Zach Johnson 66/1 (General) 1pt e/w:  Zach Johnson has quietly been playing very solidly in 2018 and he looks to be returning to something close to winning form.
12672	12672	28	29	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(If you're one of them, remember, you've earned it!) In addition to Spieth, Rose and Kuchar, I'm cool on Rafa Cabrera Bello (bridge), Jason Dufner, Tony Finau and Steve Stricker as primaries. Stricker would be fine to complement the lead in two-man formats, though.
5799	5799	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he has even a mediocre week with his new putter, expect him to be in contention on the back nine Sunday. -- Kevin Maguire  Dustin Johnson  Until someone proves otherwise, Johnson, when healthy, will have a run of being in top-five contention at majors. Erin Hills is long and a perfect setup for his game.
8431	8431	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth. 1 - Jonas Blixt, Keegan Bradley, Jason Dufner, Emiliano Grillo, Bill Haas, James Hahn, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Hideki Matsuyama, William McGirt, Geoff Ogilvy, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Scott Stallings, Brendan Steele, Henrik Stenson, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland.
3599	3599	28	29	target: Tommy Fleetwood, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
7895	7895	44	44	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed has improved his year-end ranking each and every year he's been a pro, but he's going to need a very special end to 2017 if he's to better last year's final ranking of eighth (he's currently dropped to 25th). Despite the rankings drop, Reed is insistent he's currently playing better than last season - he's been in the top 25 in eight of his last 11 events; he was fourth on his Bridgestone debut in 2014, and 15th the year after. I'd certainly back him to be higher than 25th in the world when 2018 rolls around.
6028	6028	14	14	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, many other studs missed the cut as well. Oh what could’ve been if Casey and Fowler didn’t falter on the weekend. On to the Travelers Championship.
1921	1921	27	28	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry $7,000 – Very low price, Oostyesque if you know what I’m saying. C-List  Cameron Smith $6,900  Jim Herman $6,900  Ryan Brehm $6,700  Steve Stricker $6,600  Robert Garrigus $6,600  That is all for this week. Per the usual hit me up on twitter if you have questions or need help.
325	325	6	6	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico #bets Knox (CIMB correl) 80 Moore (CIMB) 100 3 amigos - Sergio 25, Rahm 30, Rafa 80 Hend (OEM, CIMB) Top 10
6749	6749	37	37	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rounds of 68-68-62 (a career low) got the Texas-based 26-year-old into the Final Group with Spieth and going down the last Danny and Jordan were level with the clubhouse leader Tom Gillis. However an untimely bogey saw Lee miss out by a single shot on a play-off that Spieth rather predictably won. Fact is though, Deere Run suits the New Zealander down to a tee and we know that he's one to follow when he's in form and conditions are receptive.
4658	4658	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I guess it is suitable for Finau as he has finished 10th and 12th in his only attempts at this course. Finau ranks 4th in GIR%, 6th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 17th in BoB%. I will only be using Finau in GPPs as he is volatile in nature and can finish T10 or miss cut.
7388	7388	20	21	target: Matt Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
6178	6178	34	35	target: Rory McIlroy: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ultimately, we're looking at another second-shot golf course this week with greens in regulation percentage, proximity to the hole, and iron play from 150 to 200 yards key this week. Creme de la Creme  Rory McIlroy: $11,600  If Rory McIlroy doesn't barnstorm his way around this course and make one million birdies, he's not Rory McIlroy. Seriously.
7955	7955	209	210	target: Tony Finau, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 PGA Championship Picks: Show Index  3:23 Course  7:46 Key Stats  9:09 Field/Odds Breakdown  37:25 Bets & Picks  39:08 One and Done  There’s $1,000,000 up for grabs at PGA Championship on DraftKings, so Sign Up for a DraftKings Account Today and get a FREE $10!!! 2017 PGA Championship Details  Purse: $10.25M  FedEx Cup Points: 600  Defending Champion: Jimmy Walker  Course: Quail Hollow  Yardage: 7,600  Par: 71  2017 PGA Championship Key Stats  Strokes Gained: Off-The-Tee  Driving Distance  Par 4 Performance 450-500 Yards  Strokes Gained: Approach  Ball Striking  2017 PGA Championship Picks: One And Done  Team Mayo:$6,523,697  2017 PGA Championship Pick: Adam Scott  2017 Golfers Used: Jimmy Walker, Jamie Lovemark, Martin Laird, Jon Rahm, Sean O’Hair, Dustin Johnson, Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland, Henrik Stenson, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Justin Rose, Tyrrell Hatton, Branden Grace, Lucas Glover, Martin Kaymer, Patrick Reed, Nick Taylor, Rickie Fowler, Kyle Stanley, Shane Lowry, Brendan Steele, David Hearn, Harris English, Kelly Kraft, Matt Kuchar, Charley Hoffman, Daniel Berger  Team Stewart: $2,231,161  2017 PGA Championship Pick: Brooks Koepka  2017 Golfers Used: Pat Perez, Luke List, Gary Woodland, Harris English, JB Holmes, Paul Casey, Daniel Berger, Martin Kaymer, Wes Bryan, Francesco Molinari, Thomas Pieters, Charley Hoffman, Jordan Spieth, William McGirt, Brendan Steele, Jon Rahm, Ryan Moore, Tony Finau, Marc Leishman, Patrick Cantlay, Peter Uihlien, Branden Grace, Bubba Watson, Danny Lee, David Lingmerth, Curtis Luck, Andy Sullivan, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele  Mayo’s 2017 PGA Championship Picks: Value Bets  Outright Winner (2x Units)  Jon Rahm +2500  Outright Winner (Full Units)  Adam Scott +4000  Outright Winner (3/4 Units)  Daniel Berger +6600  Outright Winner (1/2 Units)  JB Holmes +9000  Tony Finau +10000  Louis Oosthuizen +11000  Kyle Stanley +15000  Outright Winner (1/4 Units; e/w)  Jamie Lovemark +20000  James Hahn +22500  Outright Winner (1/8 Units; e/w)  Bud Cauley +25000  Andrew Johnson +30000  First Round Leader (T5 Each Way)  Jimmy Walker +9000  Louis Oosthuizen +9000  Jamie Lovemark +11000  Byeong-Hun An +12500  Keegan Bradley +12500  James Hahn +12500  Patrick Rodgers +1500  Jason Kokrak +17500  Luke List +17500  Scott Brown +20000  Jonas Blixt +20000  Matt Dobyns +40000  The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.

10565	10565	2	2	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
1672	1672	10	10	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Honda Classic - 3ew Thomas 12-1; 1ew Kisner 60-1, Kaymer 70-1 #HondaClassic
537	537	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke. Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13
4634	4634	106	107	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Check twitter and the weekly FGI email if there are any AM/PM splits to worry about. Stats  LARGEST CORRELATIONS Bogey Avoidance 61.70% Birdie or Better % 61.41% SG : Tee to Green 60.66% Scrambling % 47.35% Greens in Regulation % 45.54% SG : Putting 44.87% SG : Approach 42.88% SG : Off the Tee 33.78%  The Strokes Gained stats to focus on in order (not including Tee to Green):  Approach  Putting  Off-The-Tee  Around the Green  Counting stats to focus on in order:  Bogey Avoidance  Birdie or Better %  Scrambling %  Greens in Regulation %  Par-4 Scoring  Approaches from 125 – 175 Yards  The Golfers  The Core  Dustin Johnson ($12500): Priced fairly reasonably at $12500 – although a full $1500 more than the next guy – Dustin Johnson is clearly the best player in this field and it’s not close. He was only owned at 15% last week and didn’t come close to paying off his price tag (although a Sunday surge gave him a respectable finish), and with Sergio and a trending-up Brooks Koepka priced at five figures, DJ may see lower ownership than he should have.
1228	1228	2	2	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, Brandon Grace has a history of going back to South Africa in December and playing throughout December and strong into January. Over the last five years, Grace has started out the new year with a 2nd and a 7th at the Volvo Golf Champions on the European Tour. Last year, he took 4th at the BMW South African Open which led into a strong desert swing with a victory in Qatar and a 5th in Abu Dhabi.
516	516	1	1	target: Lunde 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: neutral			Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
703	703	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			made two bets for the Valero so far Palmer 50 to 1 Reed 35 to 1 Holding pattern for tee times / weather
760	760	13	13	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings selections  As ever the three players above will be plugged in lineups. Walker is by far the most expensive of the three at $9,600, whilst Martin and Watney are available at a more modest $7,600 and $7,500 respectively. Plugging these three players in your lineup leaves you with an AVG Salary of $8,433 for three more players.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
620	620	4	4	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Main targets Kisner +25 Fitzpatrick +28 Horschel +35 Knox +40 Bryan +60 Wasting $$$ on B.A.D. +40 Willett +66 Bello +66 Lee +100 CAM +125
4369	4369	11	11	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a lock in cash or GPP contests. Value Plays  Daniel Berger $8,300 – Here’s a nice nugget of info for you…Berger has the same Vegas odds to win this event as Webb Simpson. However, he’s $1,400 cheaper on DraftKings.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
5615	5615	3	3	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But not before Johnson raises another U.S. Open trophy and lets the noise wash all the way over him. There are no trees on this property so that unforgettable noise will rise into the ether and disappear forever. And remember that harmonious barrel fire off of Johnson's clubs as he bends and unfurls his spindly frame into shot after shot at Erin Hills and winds his way around the old farmland.
8935	8935	21	22	target: Luke List… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations. Now we head to another course with an easy pack of par 5s.
1803	1803	2	2	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Webb Simpson -- Simpson has been making cuts but doing nothing particularly great. However, he is a horse-for-course here, like buddy Bubba Watson.
1432	1432	19	20	target: Jerry Kelly 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A mere glance at the form bank instantly reveals an outstanding value bet. How on earth was course specialist Jerry Kelly matched at [300.0] on the exchange? Winner in 2002, Kelly has made the top-20 on 11 of 17 renewals this century, including top-nines in the last three.
1987	1987	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking back at the final scores over the past few years we see some dramatic changes. Last year it was Vaughn Taylor winning with a -17, the year before Snedeker won with a -22 score but in 2014, with howling winds and some rain on Sunday, we seen Jimmy Walker win with a -11 winning score. I am expecting this week to be somewhere closer to 2014 as Pebble Beach has been receiving rain since the weekend and it's expected to continue through Friday.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
2705	2705	0	1	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar  Price: $10,200  Kuchar enters with both good form and positive course history, having netted three Top-22 finishes in his last four overall events and four Top-15 finishes in seven career starts at Copperhead. Moreover, since 2013-14, Kuch ranks 10th in strokes gained on hard courses and 11th in strokes gained on less-than-driver courses, both of which define Copperhead. While Justin Thomas is likely to be the popular choice with the way he's playing, Kuch is a reliable contrarian play at $1,700 cheaper.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
13683	13683	0	1	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
6002	6002	9	9	target: Leishman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TRAVELERS CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE HISTORY : THE GOOD  1. Marc Leishman, $9,300  Leishman has played this event in each of the last five years, making the cut each time and never finishing worse than 39th. It’s a run which includes a win in 2012, an 11th in 2014 and a ninth last year.
6883	6883	45	45	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore ranked first for GIR and nobody played the par fives better. Spieth managed to win here in 2013 when playing the long holes in just six-under-par but 12 of the last 13 winners have played them in at least eight-under-par for the week and Moore played them in nine-under-par. Is There an Angle In?
293	293	6	6	target: Schniederjans 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @ollie_gt at 74/1 in @TheHondaClassic. Schniederjans is a big talent and the American has caught the eye with 2 top tens in last 3
1413	1413	22	22	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sub $8million Salary Players :  Positive: Ryan Blaum and Charles Howell III deserve respect as highlighted and I cannot believe that Chris Kirk is available at ($7.7m). Kirk was top-priced $11.3m at the RSM Classic last time out for him and a missed cut there has seen his salary plummet by $3.6 million. That's a huge downshift and one that needs to exploited as Kirk is a TifDwarf Bermudagrass green specialist who otherwise finished 2016 brilliantly.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
225	225	1	15	target: Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sorry, Adam. Bamberger: I think the USGA is looking for a TV show and Adam Scott will get his wish and Hogan will spin again, as he did when Scott won the Masters with the long putter, when caddies started reading greens via a map and when players started failing to show up for Friday tee-times after shooting Thursday 77s. Wood: I definitely think it is an easier setup in terms of fairway width and lack of penal rough around the greens.
10622	10622	22	23	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's a great venue for him to keep his hot play going and I'm happy to get involved at 35/1. Outsider: Back Scott Stallings e.w. @ 200/1  Finally, I'm going to throw a bit of a dart at Scott Stallings at a massive price.
1423	1423	19	19	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I’ll take one of the best putters in the world at +2300 here. Not many guys are talking about Dufner this week. I’m plugging him into the majority of my Draft Kings teams as well as buying him at +5000 to win the Sony.
1045	1045	21	21	target: Kirk's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
9995	9995	20	20	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I don’t know how it’s going to start out, but I’m very optimistic." Contrast that with a year ago, when Mickelson arrived here with close to zero expectations having had two surgeries since his last competitive outing. In fact, his first full round of golf in over three months came the Saturday before tournament week, so the only thing surprising about a performance which tapered off to 21st was that it started so well.
7881	7881	14	15	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vamos! EXPERT MIKE McALLISTER , Managing Editor LINEUP | BENCH Rickie Fowler  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Jordan Spieth  Branden Grace  Adam Scott  PROJECTED CHAMPION Jordan Spieth Dustin did it earlier this year. No reason why Spieth can’t win three straight.
9207	9207	1	1	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gary Woodland – Cash Games – DK: $9400 FD: $9000  Woodland looked good last week finishing T18 and has shown solid form lately with six straight made cuts. Finishing 2nd here last season Woodland is sure to draw high ownership on both DraftKings and FanDuel given his salary. Chesson Hadley – FanDuel Value – DK: $9900 FD: $7400  Hadley’s price on FanDuel remains ridiculously low for another week.
374	374	6	6	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Berger/Kuchar/Kirk have me at first look. Berger is essentially an every start bet for me now, Somewhere along the… https://t.co/GepfpOJK8N
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
4834	4834	31	32	target: Chris Kirk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Path to Victory : Below are the end of round positions for the last 7 winners:  2016 - Jordan Spieth: Round 1: 9th, Round 2: 3rd, Round 3: 1st. 2015 - Chris Kirk: Round 1: 26th, Round 2: 15th, Round 3: 4th. 2014 - Adam Scott: Round 1: 64th, Round 2: 36th, Round 3: 11th.
669	669	4	5	target: L. List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: L. List - 60/1 J. Spaun - 66/1 N. Taylor - 150/1 M. Jones - 175/1 S. Power - 200/1 Top 20s to follow. Weak field!
11791	11791	23	23	target: Simpson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he is to do so, it will likely be on a shorter, tougher, championship style layout like the Copperhead course at Innisbrook. Simpson’s last four opening rounds on bermuda greens have been 67-67-69-66 and he opened with a 67 here last year. Simpson will be teeing off at 08:07 on Thursday morning so will therefore get the best of the greens, something he should hopefully relish given his current form with the putter.
11031	11031	40	41	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s always a danger he’ll hit a wall like Brian Harman and Chez Reavie have before him, but he’s simply playing too well to be overlooked, especially when you’re getting a discount because of the bigger names in the field. Martin Kaymer  The former world’s No. 1 has been middling with results for about two years now.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
383	383	2	2	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Valspar bets: Berger 35-1 Dufner 40-1 An 50-1 Simpson 60-1 Horschel 65-1 Watney 100-1 Ollie 110-1 Saunders 500-1
1689	1689	9	9	target: Rory, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
9890	9890	2	3	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T29  Chris Kirk 1pt EW 60/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Chris Kirk is another who fits the bill very well this week. A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago.
237	237	22	23	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At $9,100 he makes an excellent value play in any format. Also Consider - Hideki Matsuyama  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Patrick Reed  Vegas Odds - 50/1  Draftkings - $8,800  FantasyAces - $5,600    Don't get me wrong I love Sneds as well but with the amount he is being discussed I tend to find myself leaning on some other options in this range. Topping that list is Patrick Reed.
10732	10732	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
315	315	32	32	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are wide and can offer players the opportunity to be aggressive so be on the lookout for guys with good GIR, par 4 scoring and strokes gained putting stats. Jason Day 13/2  With five birdies in the first six holes of his second round Day looked in complete control. He then unfortunately undone all that good work by going bogey-double-bogey on 8,9 and 10.
4033	4033	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons. I would not roster Kirk in cash games, but for GPP purposes his ownership will be extremely low.
5798	5798	23	23	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With so much doubt, I'm going with chalk and taking the best player, one who has already proved he can win this title. Johnson recently told me he really likes the challenge of playing tough golf courses and grinding out pars. That's enough to earn my pick.
5887	5887	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			275 yards (46th), 85.7% fairways (9th), 72.2% greens in regulation (34th), proximity to hole 32'0" (45th), 95.0% scrambling (1st), 1.67 putts per GIR (11th). 2010, Bubba Watson (-14). 321 yards (1st), 66.1% fairways (58th), 70.8% greens in regulation (38th), proximity to hole 31'5" (25th), 57.1% scrambling (43rd), 1.63 putts per GIR (2nd).
8381	8381	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are my picks for 2017 Northern Trust. Jason Day 20/1 (Betfred 6 places 1/4 odds) 2 pts e/w:  Jason Day looks to have found some consistency again and when that happens it is time to stand up and take notice. Day is still win-less so far this season, however he has twice gone close finishing 2nd at the AT&T Byron Nelson and T5 at Pebble Beach earlier in the year.
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
12266	12266	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson sealed his third win in consecutive starts when taking the title 12 months ago and already ranked World No.1 at the time, whilst Day was also coming off the back of a win at the Arnold Palmer and was ranked 2nd in the world before his win here in 2016 took him to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings. With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years.
10969	10969	26	26	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ironically, he also ranks ninth in birdies from the fairway and is also the only player who shows up in the top 10 of both lists. Scott has also historically been great here: an 11th, second, and 10th in his last three attempts here. Here’s hoping Scott snaps out of his funk at a familiar place.
11313	11313	32	33	target: Patrick Cantlay. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
3100	3100	17	18	target: Trey Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Roll with him when you just need a cut-maker for cash game purposes. Best bargain basement option  Trey Mullinax $6.500 – News flash…Trey can BOMB the golf ball! He was one of the biggest hitters on the Web.com Tour last year.
13018	13018	16	17	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hatton is currently available at a market-leading 80/1 with Ladbrokes if you prefer . Result: T44  Patrick Cantlay 1pt EW 75/1 with *For the latest bet365 Opening Account Offer details see below. A look at recent each-way Augusta returnees shows a liking for a number of correlating courses.
538	538	10	11	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13 Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke.
12238	12238	13	14	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			😯 https://t.co/CbmNc6XCsX — Brendan Porath (@BrendanPorath) March 20, 2018  Group 5 Hideki Matsuyama  Patrick Cantlay  Cameron Smith  Yusaku Miyazoto A fairly difficult group to assess, with top seed Hideki Matsuyama having only made his return from injury last week and the other three all making their debuts in the event. Cameron Smith's form has just dipped slightly so it's Patrick Cantlay who rates the biggest danger to Matsuyama, as he certainly has the game and the temperament to thrive in the format. Indeed, with Matsuyama's long-game extremely rusty at Bay Hill, it would be the consistent Cantlay who gets the vote to advance and as he's seeded to face Tyrrell Hatton in the last-16, the Californian is worth backing at prices around the 50/1 mark.
3902	3902	6	7	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s an excellent play this week. Adam Hadwin ($9,100) – No course seems to be too tough for Hadwin this season. He’s been red hot tee-to-green, and were it not for some bizarre putting errors on his part last week, he’d have likely been in contention for the win.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
4599	4599	40	40	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s all been his approach game. After losing (a lot) of strokes to the field on approach shots every event from February through April (3 MCs – And one DJ – and no finish better than T38 in six starts) Reed has it going the other way his last two times out. He gained 3.8 strokes on the Wells Fargo field with his irons, good for a T12, and another 4.8 at THE PLAYERS en route to a T22.
5883	5883	11	12	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2012: Charley Hoffman (2nd) -11; Tim Clark (4th), Matt Kuchar (8th), Bubba Watson (2nd) -10; Brian Davis (4th), Billy Hurley III (47th) -9. Winners : 2016: Russell Knox (-14); 2015: Bubba Watson (-16); 2014: Kevin Streelman (-15); 2013: Ken Duke (-12); 2012: Marc Leishman (-14); 2011: Freddie Jacobson (-20); 2010: Bubba Watson (-14); 2009: Kenny Perry (-22). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
3440	3440	27	28	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His combination of power, iron play, and poise should serve him very well regardless of the conditions, and you simply cannot beat the price tag this week. Bill Haas ($7,200) – Lost in the fray of big name, sexy picks will be boring Billy who could be the most patient golfer on the entire course this week. Regardless of the conditions – and he’s played every year since 2010 – Haas has carded nothing worse than a T42, and nothing worse than a T24 in the past four years.
1111	1111	26	26	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers in this price range with LT metrics comparable to Castro’s have historically generated a +3.42 Plus/Minus on DraftKings with 56.8 percent Consistency. #SeaIslandMafia underboss Zach Johnson is 18th in the field with a 66.9 percent LT DA. Johnson’s 68.9 LT Adj Rd Score is third, his 14.1 Adj Bird Avg ranks sixth, and his 28.6 LT Putts Per Round — a large part of Kisner’s win last year — is fifth.
86	86	15	16	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rostering one of my least favorite DFS players this week, based on a gut feeling: Chris Kirk.
10595	10595	7	7	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Catch him while he’s on the rise. Keegan Bradley  There are few as anti-Keegan than I, but he’s been lights out tee-to-green, and it feels like he’ll eventually catch a decent putting week to put it all together. Many will probably be on Webb Simpson because of the course history this week; however, Bradley is basically the value Webb with exactly the same upside.
5746	5746	9	9	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Outside of his putting and around the green play, Day hasn’t been great lately and has now lost strokes to the field on approaches in six of his last eight rounds. Despite this inefficiency, Day has still amassed second and 15th place finishes over his last two starts, with the 15th place finish at the Memorial representing his best ever finish at that event. Day is so good around the greens that even if his approach game improves a little this week that alone could propel him to a win, and while we may fear the tough U.S. Open setup Day has proven capable of peaking for this event as he already has five top-10 to his name in just six U.S. Open starts.
310	310	3	3	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
8226	8226	20	20	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips.
2267	2267	30	30	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He played well throughout the week but shot a disappointing 80 in round two but bounced back with a 64, 66 over the weekend to post nine under in total. Scott then played in his native Australian Open finishing T14 for the tournament on six under which included a second round 65. He has a great record here in Riviera finishing second last year, tenth in 2013, T17 in 2012, T14 in 2008, second in 2006 and a win in 2005.
486	486	34	35	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hoffman snuck inside the top 15 as well with a closing 4-under 67 and he's a past champ at TPC Boston. Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week.
10118	10118	15	16	target: Webb Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reavie has 12th- and 17th-place ties in the last two years at the CareerBuilder, too. Webb Simpson  Happy learned how to putt. Uh oh.
13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.
2051	2051	16	17	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is always a threat in less than normal conditions and this week is just that. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  We were high on Phil in Phoenix last week and he got it within two strokes of the lead making the turn on Sunday before posting a four-over 40 on the back nine to finish 16th. He will look to turn that around this week at a place he absolutely loves.
9876	9876	26	27	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Abu Dhabi (without DJ,Rose,McIlroy) Skybet 1/4 12345  Branden Grace 16-1  Paul Dunn 50-1  Dylan Frittelli 50-1  Callum Shinkwin 100-1  CareerBuilder Skybet 1/5 1234567  Webb Simpson 22-1  Jason Dufner 28-1  Chez Revie 40-1  Tom Hoge 100-1  ADVERTISEMENT  16 x 0.15 e/way doubles = 4.8 points  TOP-20 Stan James  Tom Hoge 9/2  Wes Bryan 10-3  Dylan Frittelli 11-4  Pablo Larrazabal 9/2  Callum Shinkwin 6-1  6 x 0.5 point doubles = 3 points  A quiet start to the column last week. Whilst the PGA players read the script in Hawaii, the less said the better about South Africa, where the impressive Chris Paisley won his maiden very easily from local and tournament fav Branden Grace. It really does feel as though events other than the select top few are open to any player these days and anyone following a group of youngsters over a cliff really shouldn’t be giving up any time soon, clearly at any price.
9206	9206	20	20	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although past course history should not be entirely ignored Perez really has shown he is a new player now. Gary Woodland – Cash Games – DK: $9400 FD: $9000  Woodland looked good last week finishing T18 and has shown solid form lately with six straight made cuts. Finishing 2nd here last season Woodland is sure to draw high ownership on both DraftKings and FanDuel given his salary.
12059	12059	26	26	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a T7 and T17 in his only two efforts here and has yet to miss a cut this season. Of his eight PGA events, Grillo has two top-10s, including at a very tough Honda Classic in which he finished T8. Grillo performs well on tough courses, can play in the wind and is a very strong second-shot golfer.
3812	3812	11	12	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am forgiving him for last week's MC at Augusta National. Jason Dufner (8): His game looks balanced for a change as his putting has been strong recently. If he keeps the putter hot then there is no reason he shouldn't be near the top of the leaderboard come Sunday.
1024	1024	7	8	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			• • •  Mike Glasscott  Projected champion: Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world.
11849	11849	19	19	target: Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			That same person isn’t going to magically lead in Driving Distance if they’re not a bomber. And what does Streelman do well? He’s incredibly efficient getting to the green.
8416	8416	12	12	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
55	55	7	8	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Wyndham Championship top 10 picks  1. Patrick Reed -- Reed is a former winner here, doing that in 2013 for his first PGA Tour win. He had a good finish in Rio (final-round wise), and he's been a top-15 mainstay most of the summer.
4249	4249	21	22	target: Patrick Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas at 40/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - consistent type is better equipped than most to deal with course switch  0.5pt e.w. Patrick Rodgers at 200/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - T2 in the 2015 renewal and worth chancing to bounce back to form  0.5pt e.w. Smylie Kaufman at 500/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - speculative but better on last solo start and may surprise  1pt e.w.
1444	1444	2	2	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Think Patrick Cantlay is worth support at 40/1 in the @attproam. Cantlay won his first @PGATOUR title towards the e… https://t.co/9JX6aPY6BO
1527	1527	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Early in the season, I like to go with a player who has started hot. Kevin Kisner had a great weekend at the Sony Open and when he gets hot, he can go low. This week the winner will need to go low.
221	221	3	3	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Small bets on Mickelson and Streb outright in Phoenix. One of two obvious others - Finau, Steele, English - look priced about right.
6581	6581	18	18	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed has 21 tags on FanShareSports, but seven of those are sit calls. People are moving off of Reed at a point in the season he is playing his best golf. Four of his last five events have resulted in a T20 or better finish.
1572	1572	23	24	target: Hudson Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Count on him to tear it up here even at this price with plenty of shots at those nice FantasyDraft birdie streak bonuses. Hudson Swafford ($15,300, Cash or GPP) – The Swafficer has been one of my absolute favorites over the past year. Why?
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
7689	7689	19	20	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here.
1250	1250	31	31	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field. While four of the top six golfers in the world rankings are on hand, the tournament takes a hit with the absence of No.
2785	2785	13	14	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			USA TODAY Sports  Here are some golfers to consider for this weeks card. Jason Dufner - Jason Dufner has three straight top-25 finishes and enters this week ranked 14th in driving accuracy percentage and sand save percentage. Dufner is hitting a good ball right now and enters an event where he’s finished top-30 in each of his last eight appearances.
3256	3256	1	2	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Jimmy Walker: $7,600  At No. 22 in the Official World Golf Ranking, Jimmy Walker's pedigree should command something higher than a $7,600 salary. He hasn't missed a cut in his past six starts in Houston.
13161	13161	19	19	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yep, we're definitely in KK country this week and I fully expect to see him up there. Last year, Kisner said: "I just feel like it's a great shot-maker's course. You can be in the fairway and have to carve shots into the pin.
6533	6533	3	4	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Jason Sobel  Jimmy Walker  Just when you thought he was done, Walker gets to return to a course where it has always been feast or famine: two missed cuts (including 2014, the last time he played the tournament), as well as two fourth-place ties and a runner-up to boot. "Sky" Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31.
11563	11563	2	2	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I want DJ as my anchor. DraftKings Picks:    Dustin Johnson ($11,900): He's the defending champ here and playing well early in the year. Branden Grace ($7,700): Had a pair of podium finishes in alittude over the last four months.
2117	2117	20	20	target: Laird’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Laird’s record at Riviera is MC-54-25-MC-MC-65-11, nothing special but he did record his best result in Los Angeles last season. Laird’s driving the ball much better than he did last season (12 v 103 in total driving) and he’s always been capable of making a hat-full of birdies, even on difficult courses. A fourth tour win isn’t out of the question.
7803	7803	10	10	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of my lineups will have Casey on them. Adam Scott ($8,800) – Seriously, why is Adam Scott priced in the 8k range whenever there is a strong field. Scott has 3 top 15’s in his last 4 tries here to go with a win back in 2011.
9520	9520	25	25	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
10343	10343	21	21	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			According to his PGA TOUR profile, he also resides in Scottsdale. Ranking the Field I've been slow to jump on the Harkins train since his Web.com Tour results weren't anything to drool over. However, it's impossible to keep ignoring his torrid form.
10396	10396	22	22	target: Piercy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Cherry Hills: Winner: Billy Horschel; EW Places: Watson, Hoffmann, Fowler, Palmer. TPC Summerlin: Winner: Ben Martin; EW Places: Streelman, Knox, Simpson, Finau, Piercy. 2015 :  Old White: Winner: Danny Lee; EW Places: Streb, Henley, Hahn.
10206	10206	63	63	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is concern regarding how well his surgically-repaired back will hold up, but he had a positive outing in the Hero World Challenge in early December (T-9), despite a minuscule field and a few top-ranked golfers by all accounts treating it as an exhibition event. Even so, an $8,900 salary on FanDuel this week has a significant amount of value in it if Woods makes the cut and shows very capable top-25 upside. He won the event in 2013, but Woods is clearly a different golfer now in 2018.
12025	12025	29	30	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hatton is great off the tee and wields a strong putter, so if he can hit a few irons within birdie range he’ll be a strong contender come Sunday. Bubba Watson, $10400 – Bubba pounced back into form with a win at the Genesis Open to end the West Coast Swing, and now has the chance to close out the Florida Swing in style as well after back-to-back top-10s. Watson has enjoyed decent success at Bay Hill with his best finish a T4 in 2012, so look for another made cut and plenty of par-5 birdies for the unconventional bomber.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
5267	5267	5	6	target: Charley Hoffman: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			24th in strokes gained: total. Charley Hoffman: $6,500  A definite head-scratcher priced this low, Charley Hoffman is 15th on Tour this season in strokes gained: off-the-tee and 29th in strokes gained: tee-to-green. In other words, another solid player here, folks.
7694	7694	1	1	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas, $6,900. His record at Firestone is OK, but Haas has been solid for months up until a missed cut at the Open. He’s in good form and a high finish is right around the corner.
10873	10873	3	3	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last 50 starts? Casey has made the top 10 in 40% of them. Filter it down to top sevens (the number of payout places on offer) and it's 26%.
2910	2910	14	14	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s also playing pretty well with two top 5’s in his last 4 starts. Rose loves playing here at Bay Hill. This will be his 11 appearance overall, and in his previous 10 starts 5 top 10’s.
4458	4458	28	29	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 100/1 I really like Berger’s chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard, as he looks to add a second PGA Tour title in as many years. Branden Grace 100/1 (SkyBet 1/4 7 Places) 0.5pt e/w:  The South African is one of those players that you would have expected to have a much better record here at TPC Sawgrass, especially given his record on Pete Dye Courses. Grace has a great record at Harbour Town with a win, a 7th and an 11th place finish to his name there, and also finished 3rd at the 2015 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.
156	156	17	17	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a solid performance in Sedgefield last week Sneds is certainly worth a second look here. Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend.
6553	6553	19	19	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			English has recovered from his midseason missed cut stretch with 4/5 straight made cuts. Looking at his Vegas odds English stands out in his price range and I think he does without a crazy high level of ownership. Much like Finau the weakest part of his game is minimized at this course.
1594	1594	8	8	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Wow. Even with a nasty backslide on Sunday, Rahm still did what Rahm does best and birdied his way back to even par on the day. He’s just a sensational talent and an excellent candidate to find his first win this season.
1845	1845	38	38	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This time he has been much more consistent, finishing T14 at Torrey before his T16 last week, so I am full of confidence once again, that Mickelson can get his first win since the 2013 Open Championship. Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here.
3230	3230	15	15	target: Billy”, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This will be the third stroke-play event in a row I have gone for “Alligator Billy”, so I hope he repays the faith this week. Another player that fits the same mould as Horschel is Russell Henley, who is also somewhat of a course specialist. Henley has finished 5-4-7 here on his last three starts and ranks 13th in Par-4 Efficiency 450-500 yards and 20th in Greens in Regulation.
7388	7388	21	21	target: Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
4085	4085	46	47	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ownership projections you see here are my initial projections and will be updated as the week goes on so be sure to follow me on twitter to find out where you can get all the most updated ownership information. While it’s still early, this week Patrick Reed looks to be a good candidate if you’re looking for low ownership. While it’s clear he isn’t playing great now, his price has continued to drop and at some point you can expect Patrick Reed to bounce back.
1043	1043	34	34	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's obviously played well here in the past but the double bogey potential is there, so I will wait for a less penalizing course to use Howell III. The hard part is deciding between Kirk and Chappell. Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events.
4374	4374	10	11	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you grab a Berger this week in tournaments. William McGirt $7,900 – McGirt has some ties with North Carolina, and he’s been in solid form his last two events. He’s another ball striker type that is especially deadly with his irons.
886	886	5	5	target: @SmylieKaufman10 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			After being on 309/1 winner @SmylieKaufman10 here 2 years ago I'm backing him again at 66/1 in @ShrinersOpen. Kaufman was tied 4th on Sunday
421	421	2	2	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4. Patrick Reed, United States -- The new FedEx Cup points leader after his fifth career victory last week in The Barclays, Reed will make his fourth start in the Deutsche Bank Championship and last year's was his best. He played the middle rounds in 67-67 and finished in a tie for fourth, although he was seven strokes behind winner Rickie Fowler.
116	116	19	19	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, at $8,300, you can virtually get the same caliber player in Alex Noren $1100 cheaper. We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic.
4198	4198	25	25	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The team dynamic was huge, something they analysed and looked back on recently. "We've been mates for a long time and we play good together," Grace told pgatour.com. "Obviously with our history at the Presidents Cup, it's been great and I think this is a good chance to get a win under the belt as a team.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
3958	3958	34	34	target: Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take him each-way at 50/1 to follow in the footsteps of Wesley Bryan and secure a first PGA Tour win. At the front end of the betting, the two I like best are Brooks Koepka and Brendan Steele. Steele has the course form (he won here in 2011) and has three other top 15s but Koepka is the bigger talent and he looks a spot of value at 25s whereas Steele doesn't at 28s.
1406	1406	29	30	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Output is available across the top 10, 15, 20 and 25 players. The top 10 published predictor model players can be seen below:  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($11.5m); 2: Jimmy Walker ($9.9m); 3: Brandt Snedeker ($9.7m); 4: Jason Dufner ($7.7m); 5: Russell Knox ($8.1m); 6: Justin Thomas ($10.5m); 7: Russell Henley ($8.6m); 8: Zach Johnson ($8.5m); 9: Hideki Matsuyama ($11m); 10: Chris Kirk ($7.7m). Predictor Positives: Jordan Spieth dominates the Predictor model this week with a virtual 500 point gap to 'course horse' Jimmy Walker.
10399	10399	78	78	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has always been a player who, once confident, can perform at a high level for a prolonged period of time. Bentgrass, desert and altitude positive, Piercy thrives in receptive, low-scoring conditions and the Stadium Course has always been a happy hunting ground with finishes of 6th (09), 8th (10), 3rd (2013) and 15th (2014). Piercy showed on his last outing at PGA West that he's striking the ball very nicely at the moment and undoubtedly when confident, Scott mixes it with the very best.
4553	4553	47	47	target: Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Englishman recently got some good news as his T11 finish at the RBC Heritage was deemed as just good enough to meet his medical exemption requirement, allowing him to retain his tour-card until at least the end of this season. With that drama now behind him Poulter should be free to “swing freely” at this event, where he’s had some success in the past, including a runner-up finish from 2009. What I like most about Poulter here though is his recent form.
422	422	48	48	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps it simply took him a while to figure things out at TPC Boston, as he tied for 70th in 2013 and tied for 74th the following year in his first two starts on the course. For those who were playing attention, it was no real surprise that Reed claimed his fifth PGA Tour victory at Bethpage Black because he finished second in the Valero Texas Open and the Hyundai Tournament of Champions earlier this year, two of his 10 finishes in the top 10. 5.
11106	11106	32	33	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  6 - Tiger Woods  4 - Jim Furyk, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Camilo Villegas. 2 - Daniel Berger, Ben Crane, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Fabian Gomez, Russell Henley, Billy Horschel, Chris Kirk, Ryan Palmer, Adam Scott, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker.
7905	7905	16	16	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also the defending champ at Firestone, a course that suits him. -- Bob Harig  Adam Scott  Adam has been playing this event since 2003 and hasn't missed one since that first start! The good news; Scott is coming off a reasonable showing at the Open (T-22) and last year he finished T-10 at this event.
12235	12235	0	1	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Cantlay  Ben Coley provides a group-by-group guide to the WGC-Match Play Championship, with three each-way bets recommended. Group 1 Dustin Johnson  Kevin Kisner  Adam Hadwin  Bernd Wiesberger The draw for the defending champion could hardly have been kinder. Of the players in Pool B, few have been struggling as badly as Kevin Kisner of late - the fact that these struggles have taken place on courses so well suited to his game is particularly disconcerting.
509	509	19	20	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He certainly had higher hopes for a season that started pretty strongly. • • •  Adam Schupak  Projected champion: Dustin Johnson. The player who most reminds me of Long John Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA at Crooked Stick, is my pick.
494	494	23	23	target: Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lots of guys who show up in Houston show up at Wells Fargo and DBC leaderboards... i'm defintely putting a few $$$ on Castro at 275-1
4160	4160	23	23	target: Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He made the cut in his only appearance at the Valero Texas Open. While he's struggled with his normally steady putting this year, Poulter is 10th on Tour in strokes gained: around the green. But again, it's the qualitative elements that make Poults a must play.
4565	4565	31	31	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott is a lock for my cash lineup and at his salary, will be easy to fit into the majority of my lineups. I am putting my name on it – Scott and McIlroy will be the last pairing to tee off on Sunday. Martin Kaymer – $7,300  Martin Kaymer will be the most popular player this week and he is still a staple for me in cash and GPP lineups.
11228	11228	17	17	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In two previous starts at PGA National he has finished 17th or better. -- Zach Turcotte  Brian Gay  Between his poor course history and not being a household name, Gay is going to be off most people's radar this week. Couple those things with a missed cut at last week's Genesis Open, and you might think I'm crazy.
7178	7178	22	22	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event. Matt Kuchar – All Formats – DK: $7200 FD: $7500  Every Major Kuchar finds himself with a mid 7k price tag on DraftKings and every Major he seems incredibly underpriced.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
1303	1303	9	10	target: Jimmy Walker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fabian Gomez: 6th ToC/44th RSM/1st Personal Classic/MC Argentine Open. Jimmy Walker: 2nd ToC/9th Shark Shoot/15th World Challenge/35th HSBC. Jimmy Walker: 21st ToC/44th HSBC/6th CIMB/12th Shriners/1st Fry's.com.
532	532	20	20	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His switch back to a Scotty Cameron flat stick already seems to be paying dividends. Along with the improved putting, McIlroy ranks first on tour in both P5S and BoB, with ranks of fourth in PROX and 10th in DD. He has struggled with consistency this year but the small field allows owners to pay up for his tier-topping salary.
3391	3391	34	35	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds. [Phil is around 25/1]  Bubba Watson is a Masters specialist and you can’t look past that, even though his form has been horrible so far this year. It will be interesting to see him playing with that pink and green golf ball.
11116	11116	9	9	target: Thomas' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the record, Kapalua on Maui features TifEagle Bermudagrass. Thomas' Florida record isn't too bad either. 10th (2015) on course debut at Copperhead, 3rd (2016) at TPC Sawgrass and 3rd (2016) here were all achieved in Justin's first 7 tournaments in the Sunshine State and before he became the winning machine he is today.
6050	6050	49	49	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, it’s been his off-the-tee game that’s been holding him back, but that’ll turn around. TPC River Highlands features easy-to-hit fairways and greens, so I’m not overly concerned about Thomas making big numbers. Also, we’ve seen him bounce back from heartbreaks in the past, so I’m on board the JT train this week.
1509	1509	1	1	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @Thomas_Pieters at 50/1 in the #GenesisOpen. The Belgian won the 2012 NCAA title at Riviera and proved it wa… https://t.co/FAomjT6QXN
1261	1261	12	12	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			LETS DO THIS!!!!! NORTH COURSE STACK!!!!! Spaun +8000 Cink +10000 Chesson +10000 Wise +12500 Mullinax +15000 Post… https://t.co/3EHQym9alE
8231	8231	26	26	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Although there is a chance he could come in above five percent this week, I’m calling for a surprising under five percent from Branden this week. Grace is tied for 16th in the field with his 68.5 Recent Adj Rd Score, he has five top-15 finishes in his last eight events, and he has performed well in the last two PGA Championships, producing an average of 103.75 DraftKings points. Double S  As always, the first way we can use FantasyLabs to find potentially low-owned yet talented golfers in our Models is to leverage our Long-Term Adjusted Round Score (LT Adj Rd Score) metric.
5653	5653	20	20	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 34-year-old has taken his game to a new level and there aren’t many better iron players in the world. Molinari is ranked second in strokes gained with approaches to the green and is fifth for adjusting scoring average on the PGA Tour. Erin Hills is said to be a ‘second shot’ course and that plays to his strengths.
1248	1248	13	13	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And his putting and especially scrambling leave something to be desired. But, like Watson, he's still done well at Kapalua. Jason Dufner - $7,400 (40-1)    Dufner's last visit to the TOC was in 2014, when he tied for fifth.
6418	6418	16	16	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nothing else really takes my fancy so, instead, I'm going to switch markets and back Stewart Cink for a top 10. Cink is 60/1 in the outrights but a couple of things temper expectations. First, this is his tournament debut and, second, he's not won since the 2009 Open Championship.
433	433	9	9	target: Jason 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It will behoove players to stay accurate here. A:  Jason Day - He's getting hot at the right time, 2nd in FedEx rankings, Jason has 7 top ten finishes in his last 10 starts. Add to that his great record of play here: 12th (2015), 7th (2014), 13th (2013).
749	749	0	2	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Si Woo Kim showed showed some life at the Valero with a T22. If he's healthy, he and Kang could be a formidable duo at 70/1 in the Zurich.
1445	1445	4	4	target: @BrandtSnedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			First #ATTProAm bet is @BrandtSnedeker at 49/1. Snedeker absolutely loves Pebble Beach and has two wins here since… https://t.co/vL4CebF7GI
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week. Yahoo!
6351	6351	2	2	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, Taylor stands out to me in the range of players in the bottom few $100 of salary. Our VIP Spreadsheet shows Taylor gaining strokes to the field Tee-to-Green which is huge anytime you can get a punt play who is doing that. If I need to go low salary wise this week I have no issue filling out some line-ups with Taylor.
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
1117	1117	11	12	target: CHRIS STROUD 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$GOLF DFS CORE FOUR$ Sony PGA MARC LEISHMAN SI WOO KIM CHRIS STROUD KEVIN NA BMW SA @EuropeanTour ERIK VAN ROOYEN… https://t.co/D1kstsROod
10025	10025	2	2	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one. Patrick Reed ($11,100 – DraftKings, $11,300 – FanDuel)  Reed is one cocky golfer.
3688	3688	48	49	target: Branden Grace, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Perhaps remembering the early days of golf betting and the advice of Keith Elliott, I've always tended to back players at Hilton Head who didn't put themselves in the heat of battle at Augusta the week before. And this week's defending champion, Branden Grace, fits the bill. Grace was a nearest-the-finish T27 at Augusta but, rather than view that as a slight disappointment, he was probably relatively pleased given that he'd previously missed his last three cuts at the Masters.
12267	12267	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years. Since the introduction of the new format, the last three winners have won all three of their group stage matches, confirming the elite level of play needed to get the job done here.
309	309	27	28	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The long game looked largely spot on and, after a top 20 at the PGA Championship, he could be about to fire once again. The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines.
564	564	0	0	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings again this week. His $/pt better than ave (line) on handy GP chart for… https://t.co/aAFKO8CfgR
2396	2396	10	11	target: Martin Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus in truth, it will be an enormous shock were Martin Flores to challenge for the title, and it will be hard to get his odds to shorten up sufficiently to cash out. Though a winner on last year's Web.com Tour, Flores has rarely even contended at this level. Nevertheless, his credentials point to a respectable finish at least.
12883	12883	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
12469	12469	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course does grade out as a pretty strong fit so maybe, just maybe, he can break out of his massive slump. The Specialists  Retief Goosen  Emiliano Grillo  The specialist this week is Retief Goosen. The South African has flashed some form early in the year but no real consistency.
1982	1982	13	13	target: Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
5822	5822	27	27	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That win was at Royal Aberdeen which I alluded to earlier. Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week.
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
1278	1278	50	51	target: Jimmy Walker. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure you don’t roster these guys unless you are playing in the Junkies Season Long Golf League, then by all means feel free to take that goose egg. Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know.
5708	5708	20	21	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rosie’s price tag is too cheap, and he’s consistently overlooked in majors on DraftKings despite a great performance. Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,500 – “Kiz” joined us on the Tour Junkies Podcast this week after seeing Erin Hills and believes that it’s going to come down to keeping it in the fairway off the tee, chipping off these tight lies around the greens, and solid putting. Basically…that’s Kevin Kisner!
12383	12383	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
2447	2447	7	8	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great play in all formats. Adam Scott ($9,200) – Greens, you say? How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world?
6659	6659	12	12	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler finished T-3 with Marc Leishman contributing a T-5, but Patrick Reed was the only other top 20 in the professor's picks . Our expert did slightly better, picking Fowler and runner-up Charles Howell III, along with Reed and Bill Haas (T-13). It wasn't pretty -- our version of a 7-6 football game -- but man beats machine for the second straight week, jumping ahead on the season scoreboard.
1467	1467	10	10	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
11069	11069	5	5	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Far from it in fact. Walker sat second turning for home in round four last year before a dreadful back-nine saw him find water on both 15 and 17 and he showed up in his two previous visits too. He sat second at halfway two years ago and he sat fifth at halfway in 2012.
930	930	22	23	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Searchable PGA Tour results database | DraftKings salary trends | PGA Tour top-15 finish trends  My DraftKings team for this week:  1. Chris Kirk - $9,600  2. Harris English - $9,500  3.
12080	12080	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, with so much talent and Tiger at the top of this field, it’s likely many will instantly give him a hard pass. Adam Scott  We’ve seen Bubba, Casey and Gary Woodland win over the past two months — the era of bad-putting, supreme ball strikers is upon us. And Scott is the poster boy for that skill set.
7597	7597	7	7	target: Finau. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			It’s time to go all in on Finau. Gary Woodland – $7,900  Gary Woodland is Tony Finau lite. And Tony Finau is Dustin Johnson lite.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
65	65	13	14	target: Bill Haas’ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			8k-9.9k range  This is the range where there looks to be multiple options. Bill Haas’ course form in recent years is bettered only by Simpson. In his last four starts at this course he has finished 6-2-20-7.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
13683	13683	1	1	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henrik Stenson: Of all the "favorites," I think Stenson provides the best value at 25-to-1 odds. A past champ (2009), Stenson currently leads the PGA Tour in both driving accuracy and greens in regulation. Archaic stats, perhaps, but it illustrates the type of plodding necessary to tame Pete Dye's famed track.
1885	1885	34	35	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 - Aaron Baddeley, Sang-moon Bae, Jonas Blixt, Greg Chalmers, Ben Crane, James Hahn, Padraig Harrington, Billy Horschel, Russell Knox, Matt Kuchar, Shane Lowry, Graeme McDowell, William McGirt, Sean O'Hair, D.A. Points, Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Scott Stallings, Steve Stricker, Chris Stroud, Vaughn Taylor, Nick Watney, Gary Woodland. The Pebble Beach Pro-Am is always a memorable tournament although the coverage can be extremely painful to watch.
11640	11640	18	19	target: Kevin Streelman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can strike the ball as well as he was in California, Grace will contend in Tampa. Kevin Streelman  There’s always a concern Streelman simply will putt himself out of every tournament. A justifiable concern.
13036	13036	33	34	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think he's a great GPP play and could see using him in cash, but there are some better "on the surface" plays at cheaper price tags for cash games. -- Taras Pitra  Matt Kuchar  This is one of those guys I lock into my rosters every year at Augusta regardless of form. Before last week, it had been a rough season for the veteran, having only recorded one top-25.
12660	12660	30	30	target: Hoge 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sure, making two of his past six cuts isn’t all that great, but he finally got all his irons clicking again in Orlando, gaining a tournament-high eight strokes on approaches. Hoge ranks tops in the field in proximity from beyond 200 yards over the past 24 rounds and 10th from 175-200 yards. Of course, like most players on this list, his weekend status will rest on his flat stick.
684	684	8	9	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Matt Kuchar  Vegas Odds - 15/1  Draftkings - $11,500  FantasyAces - $6,000  Kuch went a second straight season without a win but recorded 11 Top 10's, his third highest total of his career. He once again proved to be one of the most consistent talents we have on Tour missing just two cuts in 26 events.
272	272	0	0	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			List is min salary with a pretty good upside this week. Has good finishes here too.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
4101	4101	23	24	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his last eight starts, his WORST finish is T-13, and he has won here. And we give you Adam Hadwin (ballstriker) and Luke Donald, who only played here once, but was T-13 and showed some good form last week. Charley Hoffman, who is money at this event.
504	504	7	8	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. A ball-striking machine right now, Adam Scott. Sleeper: At No.
44	44	17	17	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Barclays:4 win D Johnson(10), 1ew Oosthuizen (60), 1ew Horschel (100), 1ew Matsuyama (30), 0.5ew Woodland (125)
9485	9485	39	39	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Dustin Johnson  This article has been easy so far as I cannot possibly think of any other golfer who will have an absolute boom – again – than the straightest, longest player on the PGA Tour. Ever since DJ learned how to master his wedge game, he’s been an absolute force.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
2520	2520	25	25	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6) – the best ball-striker in Europe lately can demonstrate that he is firmly on the rise  1pt e.w. Matt Fitzpatrick at 125/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – three wins already and accuracy from the tee could take him a long way  1pt Kevin Na in top-five and top-10 markets at 25/1 and 10/1 respectively – should go well on the back of fourth last time out  When the PGA Tour decided that Trump National Doral was no longer for them, they meant it, because the contrast between Doral and Club de Golf Chapultepec, home of the revamped WGC-Mexico Championship, looks to be a stark one. Post-revamp, Doral had become a long-ball paradise unlike any other.
5841	5841	15	16	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, he only has one top 10 in the last five years in this event. Adam Scott – Played the weekend in his last five including finishes of T-9, T-4 and T-18 last year at Oakmont. There aren’t many better in the GIR department, and that’s why the Aussie continues to collect big checks most weeks he tees it up.
2456	2456	55	56	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week you can expect things to be a bit unique in that it’s a short field WGC event with no cut and there always tends to be a few surprises that get thrown into the mix on weeks like this. That being said the Salary Vs. Vegas Odds chart brings us the likes of Jimmy Walker who at roughly 60:1 odds is only $7,000 and on the surface seems underpriced. I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
1050	1050	31	32	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This contest has a large number of entries, with guaranteed prize payouts, which means we can't play it safe if we want to see our name at the top! DraftKings Picks:    Chris Kirk ($11,300): s the Vegas favorite, he also gets the billing of highest-priced DK golfer. The hope is the deters some ownership away from him, since he's not usually the top dog on the board.
11643	11643	15	15	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ride the wave of hot irons, and hope the short game falls into place. Cameron Smith  After an amazing run in Australia late last year, Smith came into 2018 with a ton of hype. People even were putting him in the conversation to win at both events in Hawaii.
747	747	10	10	target: Rose/Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Chasing another achievable double this week with Frittelli (45/1) into Rose/Stenson (7/1). Those prices won't last
1634	1634	20	21	target: Sam Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What price does T26 in 4 straight tourneys get you on DK? $7,100 is gonna cause some serious ownership on Sam Saunders this week for sure.
1849	1849	22	22	target: Reed’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions. Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
3612	3612	35	36	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ross Fisher – $6,900  Ross Fisher was a late addition to The Masters field, so he will definitely be overlooked and less hyped up than other golfers. His pricing fell into a crowded range with Adam Hadwin and Kevin Kisner. Fisher is a lesser known player on the PGA Tour as he is a predominately a Euro Tour golfer, which will help suppress his ownership further.
11168	11168	6	6	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix. Brian Harman - $8,900 (40-1)  Harman missed the cut his last time out at Torrey Pines, but we can excuse that after such a torrid start to 2017-18.
6210	6210	14	15	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The greens are getting firmer and faster and the rough’s not getting any shorter." David Lingmerth : "I was really calm all day. You've really got to golf your ball out here.
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
1247	1247	0	1	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson - $9,200 (15-1)    Watson certainly doesn't match the scrambling/putting criteria we are focusing on but, as always, there are multiple ways to do well on any golf course. Watson surely classifies as a bomber, and it's paid off at Kapalua, where he has tied for 10th the past two years after his best showing, a T4, in 2013. Brandt Snedeker - $8,700 (15-1)    Snedeker has two T3s on his Kapalua resume, including last year, and it's no mystery why.
2031	2031	16	17	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose, Snedeker, Kuchar, Furyk, and Lowry come to mind (see below). Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
106	106	1	1	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bubba Watson for one is also hard to ignore at $9,100. Watson has not been at his best this season, but has still not missed a cut and managed to finish 8th in Rio on his last start. He also finished 10th here in 2012 and 18th at the 2009 U.S. Open.
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
3099	3099	15	16	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA Tour Fantasy Golf DraftKings Picks – The Puerto Rico Open  Lock of the week:  Luke List $9,900 – Luke is in solid form coming off his T17 at the API. He’s played this event twice without a missed cut, including a T15 last year. We’ve heard from sources on site that the rough is basically non existent.
4307	4307	31	31	target: Simpson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may be wise not to overthink it so I'm looking for a player with a strong record in NC which includes big finishes at the Wells Fargo. Step forward Webb Simpson. Back in 2011, I had a 20/1 'win only' punt on Simpson landing the Wyndham Championship and he obliged, shooting 66-65-64-67 to secure his maiden PGA Tour title.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
11979	11979	20	21	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Instead, head has to rule the heart and therefore it's time to take advantage of the slightly inflated odds on Justin Rose. Tiger's 6/1 means Rose is a couple of points bigger than he would have been without the great man's revival and 14/1 looks very acceptable indeed. The Englishman admitted he'd found the WGC-Mexico a hard event to make his comeback after more than a month off due to the altitude and pulling of funky clubs.
8709	8709	47	47	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The T5 came in the US Open, the T20 in the Open Championship, the T13 in the WGC-Bridgestone and the T17 in The Northern Trust. Any ideas that his top five in the US Open was a one-week-only tale of little guy did good is simply wrong; Schauffele keeps going up against the world's best and performing with credit. His excellent effort at Erin Hills in the year's second major was the turning point though.
1021	1021	24	25	target: Chris Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After tying for 66th in his Sea Island debut, has missed the cut in four consecutive starts. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Chris Kirk. Lots of comfort here in Sea Island and you can’t argue with how he’s playing with three top-8 finishes in four starts already this season.
8461	8461	7	8	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recommended bets: The Northern Trust 1pt e.w. Patrick Reed at 40/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - defending champion is close to another win after best major finish 1pt e.w. Louis Oosthuizen at 45/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5,6) - superbly consistent Playoff record and arrives after T2 in the PGA 1pt e.w.
167	167	10	10	target: Fathauer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
10996	10996	22	22	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has been owned by an average of 33.3 percent of lineups in those tournaments. Last year, with a salary $500 lower, Johnson tipped the scales at 42.8 percent average ownership on his way to 123.5 DraftKings points and a +49.09 Plus/Minus. You can check out player exposure and much more with our PGA Contests Dashboard.
6554	6554	4	4	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greenbrier Classic Picks! Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9100 FD: $8900  All season watching Finau play I have been waiting for the inevitable breakout win and where better than this weak field. Finau has been exceptionally statistically this season but has struggled to put together the four rounds needed to come away with a victory.
172	172	6	6	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranked No. 1 in the world, Day should also benefit from a three-week break following his runner-up finish at the PGA Championship. David Jayne -- Keegan Bradley ($7,600)  Bradley is in solid form coming in with six consecutive made cuts with three top-25 finishes, and needs to play well to improve his current 106th place standing in the FedEx Cup.
2073	2073	10	10	target: Johnson/Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into the picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Dustin Johnson/Hideki Matsuyama ($11,500/$11,400) – Look, I understand Jordan Spieth played out of his dome last week, and I have no doubt he could ship this week too. But to put DJ and Hideki at $1,100 and $1,200 below him this week is simply blasphemous.
1051	1051	14	14	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Few darts on the machine this week for the #SentryTournamentofChampions Kisner 42.0 Berger 65.0 Kim 170.0
1430	1430	4	5	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Been waiting to roster Paul Casey again https://t.co/psaRoimA3k

4630	4630	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s playing the absolute best golf of his career, and you’d be crazy to not start almost every GPP lineup you create with him this week. Jason Day ($10,100) – Day fell apart on Sunday (as did many bombers) at Sawgrass, but that shouldn’t take away from the positives we’ve been seeing out of him lately now that he is seemingly healthy. This is a golf course where Jason Day can open up and hulk smash the golf ball with very little concern over whether he’s in the fairway or the rough.
12761	12761	47	47	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
1882	1882	11	11	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Pick to Click: 4 guys above 10k this week. I’m picking Spieth to win until he wins. So, he’s gonna win this week.
3394	3394	15	15	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts. With Adam, you can always take that his long game is going to be good, so for me, and I don’t know what the betting is, but if there’s value in the price of Adam Scott, that’s who I’d go with.
11353	11353	32	33	target: Patrick Cantlay. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PATRICK CANTLAY – 40-1 - 1pts E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 5 FINISHED 30th  My final pick of the week goes to a major champion in the making in the form of Patrick Cantlay. Those of you who read my ‘players to follow’ blog for 2018 will know that I highlighted Cantlay as a player to back in WGC’s or even Majors this year as I felt winning one of these was certainly within his compass and that in these events initially at least we would potentially be getting some more ‘juice’ in his price. Sticking to my word I’m therefore happy to side with the UCLA grad this week at what I see as a more than fare 40-1.
4989	4989	21	21	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The average driving distance at Colonial is about 275 yards, largely because longer shots may be penalized. Even though Spieth and Kirk won while ranking down the list in fairways hit, others on the leaderboard and many past champions were highly accurate. Both of them won with terrific putting, while Spieth also was the No.
5159	5159	25	26	target: Billy Horschel, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, he’s done just that the last two years, posting 8-under and 9-under on the par-5s respectively, leading to finishes of T11 and T8. Billy Horschel, $7100 – Recent Byron Nelson champ has two top-15s at Muirfield in three career starts, showcasing a nice blend of recent form and course history. Patrick Cantlay, $6600 – The youngster from UCLA earned his PGA Tour status with a runner-up at the Valspar in March and has gone on to post three top-25s in four starts since.
778	778	9	9	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
6544	6544	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
8953	8953	14	15	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In 2014, Moore successfully defended the title he first won in 2013. Last year, Justin Thomas made it two double wins in a row in the CIMB Classic. He won in 2015 and 2016.
1667	1667	18	19	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key Stats: Par 5 Scoring, Putting 10'-15', BoB% (Birdie or Better), Bogey Avoidance, Scrambling, Rough Proximity. Top-Tier Plays  Dustin Johnson ($11,100)  Dustin Johnson is "Taylor Made" for this course. He ranked sixth or better in three of our key stats from 2016 (1stt in BoB%, 4th in Par 5 Scoring, and 6th in Rough Proximity).
3769	3769	13	14	target: Chad Campbell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Please! Make the cut  Luke List $7,300  Lucas Glover $7,200  Kyle Stanley $7,200  Chad Campbell $7,100  I really don’t think you must dip below $7,000 this week, but of course you can if you choose. I probably won’t.
368	368	7	7	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Backed @wesleybryangolf at 50/1 in the @ValsparChamp. Bryan loves the Florida greens and has finished fourth in his last two tournaments
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
11475	11475	26	27	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
11468	11468	3	3	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's why:    Jon Rahm - $11,500 (12-1)  Rahm is almost $1,000 cheaper than Thomas, which is a huge deal in a $50,000 cap. Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous. Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship to close 2017 on the Euro Tour, then opened 2018 by taking the CareerBuilder.
6096	6096	25	26	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Par 4 Scoring, Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:App), Approaches 150-175 Yards, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G)  Top-Tier Plays  Patrick Reed ($9,300)  The American Ryder Cup star, dubbed the "American Eagle" by many, is back on the right track after losing it for a little bit. From Week 7 to Week 16 (six events), Reed had three missed cuts and did not finish better than 38th. He has turned that around, finishing in the top 20 three times in his last five starts and also posting a 22nd in that span.
4984	4984	40	41	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It is a smaller field this week due to being an invitational (Field size of about 120) so there will be even more of an importance of getting 6/6 through the cut. Favorite Plays  Paul Casey 10.2k  Bud Cauley 9.5k  Jason Dufner 9.0k  Adam Hadwin 8.4k  Ryan Palmer 7.9k  Pat Perez 7.6k  Nick Taylor 7.3k  Kevin Tway 7.1k  Long shot for the week – Aaron Baddeley 6.5k  Recap of Byron Nelson $100, 3 Max. Finally got back to the winning side of the $100 (normally I play $150 single but didn’t like it’s size last week).
577	577	4	4	target: Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Scott, Casey, Oosthuizen, Koepka &amp; Haas in #TheMasters. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
5482	5482	10	11	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be awesome. Berhow: Dustin Johnson wins at five under, Justin Rose is the runner-up for the second straight major and Mr. Lee Westwood is third. Zak: I've convinced myself that Jason Day will continue his recent solid form and that Erin Hills will play very similar to Whistling Straits (at least for him).
7402	7402	48	49	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Eventually he’ll get back to putting 4 rounds together and while I don’t see him contending for a win quite yet, I do expect him to notch his first top 20 finish since the Honda Classic in February, at a venue that should fit him well. Also adding Jason Kokrak as a second Semi-Flier this week. HOSEL-ROCKET BUST (Last week: Padraig MC)    Charley Hoffman– This lucky duck nearly hit his first tee ball OB on Thursday at last week’s British Open, then walked off the hole carding an eagle two.
7479	7479	3	4	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Open’s runner-up, Matt Kuchar, is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Kuchar has finished inside the top-10 here in each of the past three years the Canadian Open has been played at Glen Abbey: His 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks second in this week’s field. But it’s not just Kuchar’s course history that’s hot like fiya: Kuchar’s 67.4 Recent Adj Rd Score leads the field, thanks in part to six straight finishes of 16th or better, including three finishes of fourth or better.
497	497	2	2	target: Phil 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Welp guess Phil and PU may be my highest owned this week. With Rickie.
626	626	0	1	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zac Blair at $6500 is like stealing. Great Par 4 scorer.Driving accuracy, bogey avoidance and scrambling rank top 10 on tour.8th two wks ago
2601	2601	2	2	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
2599	2599	15	15	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Like Mickelson, he's a lot of golfer for $7,500. And averaging 3.75 birdies per round, Kaymer can fill it up. Definitely the biggest upside of anyone in the $7,400-$7,500 range.

5107	5107	11	11	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I really thought I could have got to that magic number." Scott looks a danger on any suitable course right now and this must count as one of them. Take the 25s.
12079	12079	46	46	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of the field will shy away from challenging the water, however, and that leads to a lot of long irons. Over 33 percent of approach shots come from beyond 200 yards, so it’s no surprise that players such as Tiger, Stenson, Rose, Keegan, Rory and Scott all have experienced success at this event over the years. Quality long irons will help mitigate the difficulty of the long Par 3s (three over 200 yards), the lengthier Par 4s (six over 450 yards), make the Par 5s slightly easier, and potentially open up an eagle opportunity on the 16th hole.
533	533	10	10	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			It's a week for speculative plays in Houston: Reifers 200/1, Cauley 200/1, Flores 225/1, Castro 250/1, Stefani 275/1.
12962	12962	47	47	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The problem though is with most, if not all of them, there is at least one key point potentially against them. Let’s take a look at some of the market leaders as an example starting with the player who heads up the betting [just] as I type, Rory McIlroy. Up until Bay Hill Rory had been struggling with the putter for a year plus and basically looked lost on the greens.
218	218	6	6	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Reed, Knox &amp; Simpson in Phoenix this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
1687	1687	2	2	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt Lucas Glover top-20 finish at 9/2 BetVictor Glover is still a dicey win proposition because I’m not sure his putting can stand-up to the pressure but his ball-striking alone can get him a top-20 finish. The story seems to be repeating itself in the 2016-17 season but he went close at both the Sanderson Farms Championship and the Shriners.
5014	5014	0	1	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
3874	3874	10	10	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Brendan Steele & Branden Grace – On the heels of an impressive Sunday at The Heritage, Grace seems to have finally righted his game. As will be the theme with many of the picks this week, the South African dominates off the tee and with his irons, but is lost on the greens.
10569	10569	14	15	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, he’s playing well again and was T-12 at Farmers last week. Also like: Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson. ZJ hasn’t finished outside the top 25 this season and has two top 14s in two years here since the redesign.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
7246	7246	22	23	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I prefer him at 25/1 than out-of-form Rory McIlroy and inexperienced Jon Rahm at 18s. Justin Rose and massively in-form local hero Tommy Fleetwood both have obvious links to Royal Birkdale and should go well at 25/1 and 18s respectively. A bit further down, I like Adam Scott and Branden Grace too.
38	38	0	1	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Day is now the betting favorite to win his second major championship according to the recent Las Vegas betting line that came out on Monday. Day, the defending PGA Champion after his three-shot victory over Jordan Spieth at Whistling Straits last August, has had a solid 2016 season with three wins that include the Arnold Palmer Invitational, WGC-Dell Match Play and the Players Championship against a major-type field. According to Westgate LV Superbook, at 13-2, Day is a slight favorite over 2011 U.S. Open winner Rory McIlroy, who is at 7-1 and followed closely behind by Jordan Spieth at 15-2.
8251	8251	37	38	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished 14th on debut here in 2012 after opening up with a 64 but he missed the cut in 2014 and again last year, so he's very much a chancy pick. Selections:  Chesson Hadley @ [110.0]  Scott Stallings [120.0]  Trey Mullinax @ [170.0] & 150/1 (Sportsbook)    I'll be back later with my European Tour previews. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
11974	11974	16	17	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I do not hate the idea of a Day-Noren playoff for the second time this year. Henrik Stenson ($9100) – People will most likely be off of him due to his poor performance last week. It hopefully will not take much to be overweight on Stenson and he has great history (minus last year).
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
1015	1015	5	5	target: Bryson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Final card, E/W Henley 40/1 Bryson 66/1 Kim 70/1 Bryan 125/1 Shop around, those aren’t all the best numbers. Long… https://t.co/FBeLPhLDGD
639	639	1	1	target: @BrandenGrace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Think @BrandenGrace has a big chance at 29/1 in #RBCHeritage. Grace played solidly at the Masters and successfully defended a title before
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
1272	1272	4	4	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Spieth and Reed I’ll be targeting DJ, Bubba even with him playing a Volvik golf ball, Justin Thomas, and Jimmy Walker. Here is a LU I’ll be trotting out in the PGA $150K Birdie on DK:  Spieth $11,500  Reed $9,500  Herman $6,200  McGirt $7,500  Dufner $7,400  Walker $7,800  If you are looking for a season long Golf League let us know. We have over 40 players signed up, it’ll be a great time.
100	100	18	18	target: Lindheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
730	730	4	4	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
12219	12219	71	71	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This year he has been drawn in a group with his Ryder Cup buddy Jordan Spieth, Haotong Li and Charl Schwartzel. As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through.
13126	13126	8	9	target: Matt Every, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2 - K.J. Choi, Luke Donald, Jason Dufner, Matt Every, Fabian Gomez, Billy Horschel, Si Woo Kim, Chris Kirk, Matt Kuchar, Davis Love III, Ryan Palmer, Brandt Snedeker. 1 - Ryan Armour, Aaron Baddeley, Jonas Blixt, Wesley Bryan, Jonathan Byrd, Paul Casey, Austin Cook, Harris English, Robert Garrigus, Cody Gribble, Adam Hadwin, James Hahn, Mackenzie Hughes, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Kisner, Patton Kizzire, Martin Laird, Marc Leishman, Peter Malnati, Graeme McDowell, Grayson Murray, Sean O'Hair, Carl Pettersson, Scott Piercy, Rory Sabbatini, Xander Schauffele, Charl Schwartzel, John Senden, Cameron Smith, Scott Stallings, Robert Streb, Kevin Streelman, Brian Stuard, Hudson Swafford, Nick Taylor, Michael Thompson, Nick Watney.
309	309	3	3	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Rahm, Oosthuizen, Woodland &amp; Haas in WGC-MexicoChamp. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
8228	8228	19	19	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts. We currently have Rory projected for 21-25 percent ownership in large-field guaranteed prize pools (GPPs), but I wouldn’t be shocked to see him break 30 percent in DraftKing’s Millionaire Maker.
206	206	6	6	target: Roberto 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously with Kenny on my man Roberto at 125/1. Good driver of the ball and led the field in GIR last week. 2 top… https://t.co/nT9HCVEKVs
13249	13249	29	29	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson is one of the most talented souls on tour; just not sure that translates to dividends this week. We do like Riccio's picks of Paul Casey and Zach Johnson, two players whose games mirror past RBC Heritage winners like Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, and Graeme McDowell. Same goes for his picks of Austin Cook (although the Model seemingly chooses Cook every week) and Matt Kuchar (who's won here in the past).
5896	5896	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			888Sport treble the odds on your first bet for new customers (paid in free bets) at the Travelers Championship - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Bubba Watson 1.5pts EW 33/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (7 places EW, 1/5 odds):  Bubba Watson makes a lot of sense this week and with Day, McIlroy and Spieth all in the field, it's great to see 33/1 about the 2-time Travelers champion. Bubba has always liked to do things differently and a move to Volvik balls has undoubtedly had a negative effect on his game, but there have been signs of late that the tide is turning for the 9-time PGA Tour winner.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
1358	1358	21	21	target: Berger's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			He also ranked 30th in putting 4'-8' and 22nd in putting 15'-20'. With an emphasis on Par 4 scoring this week, Berger's rank of 14th last season should be very beneficial. He also ranked 46th in our top key stat this week: GIR.
3396	3396	44	45	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes, he’s on a streak, but he wouldn’t be my choice down to the fade. He is big and strong, which is a help, but even coming off the win, and I think he’s in a happy place, no I’d definitely be sticking with Adam Scott. Phil Mickelson has obviously been playing very well, but I think his odds would be shorter because he is a favourite with the fans and that will shorten his odds.
2406	2406	29	30	target: Jimmy Walker's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut at the Career Builder Challenge but either side of that disappointing effort he's finished sixth in the Sony and 12th in Phoenix. Two-time Sony winner, Jimmy Walker's course form is similarly poor and his figures read 38-MC-40-43-67-43 but it's noticeable that he's back for more and if we dig a little deeper it makes sense. He sat second behind Rickie at halfway last year and in his previous visit, in 2012, he sat fifth at halfway.
1054	1054	13	13	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Long-term, they've both played 169 TOUR events. Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight.
1786	1786	13	14	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			So make sure you are comfortable with the stands that you take. CASH: Hideki Matsuyama is the man again this week. His course history is elite, both before and after the renovation.
6567	6567	1	1	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Danny Lee falls into the second category as a player that consistently shows form before his results. I felt given this form Lee provided cash game stability well simultaneously providing GPP upside. Lee’s performance provided both as his finished helped propel cash line-ups into the money and gave GPP lineups a solid shot at a higher payout.
165	165	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony bets thus far: Kirk 50-1, Leishman 67-1, Lahari 100-1, Fathauer 200-1 ... will probably add perez or snedker
12812	12812	12	12	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still in the middle of his comeback after major back fusion surgery, Woods has looked like a potential winner in his recent TOUR stops. After opening 2018 with a T23 at the Farmers Insurance Open, Woods missed the cut at the Genesis Open, prompting many to suggest he needed more time to get back into the real swing of tournament action. But a 12th place finish at the Honda Classic was followed by a runner up effort at the Valspar Championship — keeping the hype alive and building.
2476	2476	9	9	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll be on at 16s. The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail.
2355	2355	13	14	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you like longshots, you have to like Harrington’s history on this course. Branden Grace - One golfer who has been flying under the radar a bit is Branden Grace, who has back-to-back top-25 finishes and hasn’t missed the cut once in his last five events. Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays.
938	938	1	1	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
5461	5461	6	6	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total. Roster the veteran in this weak field event.
451	451	19	19	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Gotta give an some extra time looking into Bozzelli (55/1) and Spaun (45/1). I'm intrigued. Oh, if you want List at 33/1, get him now.
6504	6504	46	47	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All six golfers in the upper tier are close in overall tags so it will be important to pay close attention as lineup lock approaches to help decide which golfers will be the most owned and which make the best GPP plays. $8K - $9K Range  Tony Finau currently leads all golfers in all ranges in total tags and start recommendations so I fully expect him to be one of the Top 3 highest owned plays this week. I talked about him above and won't let ownership sway me from using him.
9878	9878	21	22	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Almost certain to have numerous birdie chances, he is one for whom the weekend will come and they drop. Having backed Jason Dufner for this in 2016 after watching his warm-up at the Sony, I am struggling to leave him out after a similar display last week. Yes, he was a bigger price but the horse hasn’t bolted after he ran up an impressive putting stat off an unusually average approach game and must be inspired returning to the venue of the victory over David Lingmerth in a memorable play-off here two years ago..
571	571	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Matt Kuchar -- Kuchar went to Georgia Tech and he plays pretty well in this college hometown event. However, his form has slipped in the playoffs.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
2933	2933	17	17	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Swede is looking for his first victory since winning The Open last summer. Taras Pitra: Kevin Kisner ($7,600)  When looking at Kisner's stats, it's amazing to me that he hasn't won yet. What's even more surprising to me is how he has managed only two top-10s in five events.
763	763	26	27	target: Ryan Blaum 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may be a week where you don’t need to take anyone in this range but if you do, there are a few to choose from. Ryan Blaum has taken to life on the PGA Tour well, finishing T26 and T11 in his first two events this season. He also finished T29 at the OHL Mayakoba Classic last year.
6105	6105	15	16	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You will see me reference these in my articles and videos. Top Course History Targets  Bubba Watson  World Golf Ranking (#40)  Vegas Odds (40/1)  Draftkings ($8,400)  FanDuel ($8,500)  Over the course of one's career, no one has dominated TPC River Highlands quite like Bubba. He missed the cut here in his first trip back in 2006, skipped the 2007 event and has not only made the cut in nine straight years since but has won twice('10/'15) with five total Top 10 finishes.
293	293	1	1	target: @ollie_gt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @ollie_gt at 74/1 in @TheHondaClassic. Schniederjans is a big talent and the American has caught the eye with 2 top tens in last 3
425	425	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The win still eludes him but his high-class consistency is appealing to fantasy managers. Tyrrell Hatton  Hatton was in the middle of a golden spell last year when a T10 here was the Mexican filling sandwiched between Florida T4s at the Honda and Bay Hill. He missed the cut at PGA National last week but prior to that was third in Abu Dhabi (3rd GIR) and let’s remember that he’s the World No.
333	333	18	18	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse. Looking at my sheet, there are only two other golfers in the $7,500+ range who have scored less DraftKings points per tournament(41) than Rahm.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
875	875	6	6	target: Kaufman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on List, Lovemark &amp; Kaufman in Las Vegas this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips #golf
7892	7892	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Right now, he only has 15 tags on FanShareSports, the fewest of any golfer priced above $9,500. In the past five Bridgestone Invitationals, Rose leads the entire field in total strokes gained. He has three top 5s in the past five years at Firestone.
12399	12399	26	27	target: Ian Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last year DJ beat Rahm in the final match to take the trophy. Other winners include Jason Day (2016 and 2014), Rory (2015), Kuchar (2013) and Ian Poulter (2010). I’m not harping too much on the course because this is match play.
6279	6279	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win. He has made six straight cuts with five Top 25 finishes including a T5 last week at the Travelers Championship.
8534	8534	23	24	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Making 10/10 straight cuts Brooks is a great cash play given his price and has shown the upside to win against any field. Tony Finau – DraftKings all formats – DK: $7300 FD: $8300  The price discrepancy is too much to avoid Finau on DraftKings this week. Finau has mad nine straight cuts, finishing inside of the top 50 all nine starts making him extremely viable in cash games at this price.
3353	3353	38	38	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T4 and T6 in his two most recent trips to Augusta National. Vegas Odds  As you see, Johnson has been excellent with double-digit odds to win. Of the 18 tournaments with at least 10 percent odds, DJ posted 100 DraftKings points or more in eight.
12220	12220	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.
6392	6392	5	5	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Deal with it. *  Bill Haas & James Hahn – Haas has two T10s in five career starts, with four straight finishes inside the T25 overall entering play… HHHAAAAAHHHHNNNNNNNNN’s upside will be dictated by his putter. Much like we said about Kyle Stanley all season.
239	239	61	62	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members. It does not get any better than this anywhere in the industry.
1194	1194	16	16	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CareerBuilder Challenge picks: Winner: The Chezsticle (Reavie) Top 10: Spaun, Mickelson, Howell DK Sleepers: Na, Laird, Power OAD: Reavie
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
2851	2851	2	2	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Bill Haas - Haas was outclassed in Mexico, but he's otherwise been great this season. This is a good track for him, and he should have won here last year.
314	314	37	37	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Field: Top 100 in FedExCup Standings  TPC Boston, Norton, MA  Par 71, 7,216 yards  The Course  This week the FedExCup Playoffs travel to TPC Boston where it has hosted this The Deutsche Bank since 2003. Its Labour Day weekend in The US so this tournament will go from Friday-Monday. It is a par 71 layout with three par 5’s, four par 3’s and 11 par 4’s and has a tendency to give up very low scores.
1476	1476	44	44	target: Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mr Consistency is the lowest-risk call across the $10m+ players this week and is sure to be in the mix at PGA West, coming off a strong putting performance at Waialae. Zach Johnson tops the published predictor this week and is more 'risk/reward' than Haas. Some of that is built into his salary which is $300k below that of Haas and links to Zach's propensity here to play extremely well, or miss the cut.
687	687	14	14	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider - Harold Varner III  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Trey Mullinax  Vegas Odds - 200/1  Draftkings - $6,500  FantasyAces - $4,000    I love taking a rookie in this spot as he will most likely be extremely low owned. Oh ya and Mullinax has a tremendous amount of talent and through watching interviews, seems to have it together between the ears. PGA Tour pro Michael Thompson, who had the same college coach, went as far as to say Mullinax's raw power is best compared to Dustin Johnson.
2001	2001	15	16	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's finished in the top 15 in three of his last four starts on Tour. Phil Mickelson ($9,300)  Lefty's another Pebble Beach ringer (four-time champion and runner-up last year). He's showing signs of a turn-back-the-clock season with top-25 finishes in his last three starts.
5164	5164	32	33	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first-round withdraws to his history, he hasn't missed the cut here going back to 2008. -- Adam Daly  Patrick Cantlay  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I am going to keep going back to Cantlay until his price rises to the point to where I have a decision to consider. At $7,800 on DraftKings, below the average salary, this is still an easy plug-and-play pick in the lower range for a player who has yet to miss a cut on the season, has shown elite ball striking ability and is not bad with the flat stick.
4408	4408	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Probably not. But he definitely should be in contention through Sunday… You could swerve on to Ryan Moore here, or eat the chalk with Matt Kuchar, but I’ll be rolling with Walker. A gamble?
2767	2767	0	1	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott Brown ($6,700). I don’t think you’ll have to go too deep this week considering the strength of field, but if you want Justin Thomas or Henrik Stenson then Brown is a good option. He’s made eight straight weekends on Tour and was T-7 last year at Innisbrook.
1110	1110	22	22	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk won this event in 2013 and has an average finishing position of 7.6 in his last three starts at this tournament. Kirk is in excellent form and has extremely good recent results at this track. He’s in play for all formats.
589	589	10	10	target: Leishman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Masters 🔥 takes: Winner: Rory Top 10: Rose, Casey, 🍔, Leishman Sleepers: Pieters, Kisner, Molinari
13327	13327	1	1	target: Suri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Julian Suri  When Suri came to the States at Torrey Pines, the “pay way too much attention to golf” crowd was properly excited. An American bomber, playing primary on the European Tour, people just assumed Suri was Brooks Koepka 2.0. Hasn’t really panned out that way.
9219	9219	3	4	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor. He has three top-25 finishes in his past five events played and finished T-32 last week at the Shriners.
11200	11200	10	10	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National with four top-10s. Donald had missed three straight cuts until a T37 last week at Riviera, another track where birdies are scarce. John Huh - $7,100 (125-1)  Huh has already teed it up 10 times this season.
12033	12033	28	28	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
246	246	19	20	target: Matt Jones 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#pgatour #ATTProAm #picks DJ +900 Reed +3000 Holmes +4000 Lowry +5000 Hadwin +6000 McGirt +8000 ---- Cam Smith +10000 Matt Jones +12500
3027	3027	19	19	target: Cejka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 is the year of the Canadians, EH?! Also consider: Peter Uihlein, J.J Spaun, Cameron Percy, David Hearn, Alex Cejka  These core players will garner the most exposure (40%+) in our lineups at the Puerto Rico Open. We will be using these lineups as staples and incorporating some of the deep sleepers you need at low ownership to take down a large GPP.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
449	449	1	1	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Day loves this course and it really shows in his results as he’s landed finishes of 2nd, 3rd, 11th, 7th and 12th here in his last 6 visits. Day has been a birdie or better machine at this course over his career and is a great course horse this week. Sean O’Hair is an interesting addition to this list coming off his great week at the Barclays.
10737	10737	4	4	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All signs point to Cantlay being a great play on this course if the conditions are as good as predicted. However, if conditions deteriorate, I could see Cantlay struggling a bit on the small greens. Pat Perez ($8.6K) – Pat Perez just seems to love these shorter coastal tracks, almost like an American version of GMAC with a mullet.
4498	4498	23	23	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
6662	6662	10	11	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For more on List see this week’s PGA Breakdown. Downtown  Scott Brown is tied for 38th in the field with his respectable 70.2 LT Adj Rd Score, but his 69.9 Recent Adj Rd Score speaks to his current form: He has made three of four cuts and finished 12th at THE DEAN & DELUCA Invitational. Brown has shaky history at this event — he’s made only one cut in four starts — but he has a tendency to show up in weaker field events, finishing 17th and scoring 89.5 DraftKings points at the Puerto Rico Open earlier this season.
1544	1544	11	11	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sometimes you don't have to be long to dominate Par 5s. Johnson is well above average with his irons, ranking 41st in approaches from 125-150 yards last year and 63rd from 150-175 yards. With higher elevated greens this week, scrambling will be a key stat; Johnson ranked 25th in 2016.
4131	4131	9	9	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Everyone suffered from his missed cut last week. Now, Cink is merely an afterthought heading into the Valero Texas Open. Cink is still having a phenomenal season for his standards, consistently finishing inside the top 30 and making 11 of his last 13 cuts.
6582	6582	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has gained strokes on approach shots in six of his last seven events. There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it.
11571	11571	36	36	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event. This time around, he’s up to a career-best 11th in the OWGR and has finished top-six five times in his last six starts.
2029	2029	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
1231	1231	3	4	target: Michael Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Farmers Insurance Open: Michael Kim 350/1
1820	1820	12	12	target: Castro: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Fire him up at $7,000.
4310	4310	22	22	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That sequence includes finishing runner-up in this event at Quail Hollow in 2015 and also fourth at the same venue in 2012. Simpson is a member at QC so he clearly put the extra local knowledge to good use. Hopefully it will be a similar story this week.
10528	10528	39	40	target: Daniel Berger. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar is making his first PGA TOUR starts of 2018 so that is also a pass for me. With Z. Johnson always safe for a good finish at TPC Deere Run, I will save him for now and choose Daniel Berger. Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team for each DFS site, per week.
7676	7676	23	23	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His T2G game has been utterly superb this year, and he has the patience to handle a demanding test like Firestone. MID TIER  Sergio Garcia ($9,200) – Are there any superlatives we haven’t used yet to describe the season Sergio is having? Were it not for a terrible R1 at the British, he would’ve probably been in the mix for the entire event.
5425	5425	29	29	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
971	971	0	0	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ as the 4th highest DK price?? 6th, 10th, 6th, 1st, 9th in last 5. also, OWGR #1 if anyone had forgotten
7147	7147	8	9	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Marc Leishman at 50/1 (1/5 1-10)  1pt e.w. Branden Grace at 50/1 (1/4 1-6)  0.50pt e.w. Harry Ellis at 1500/1 (1/5 1-8)  Click here for our fully transparent tipping record  Two majors down, two to go in a puzzling 2017 and things don't get any easier with the 146th edition of the Open Championship, which returns to Royal Birkdale just north of Liverpool.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
490	490	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm willing to forgive a poor putting week and jump right back on. Jason Day ($9,300): Speaking of putting, the Aussie is in a class of his own with it comes to putting this year. Tee-to-green, he sets up great for TPC Boston and if his putting stays hot then he could definitely add some hardware by week's end.
5043	5043	8	9	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Top 25 for the 2017 Memorial  1. Dustin Johnson  2. Matt Kuchar  3.
9520	9520	25	25	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
4713	4713	21	22	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has played this event the past two years and has 12th- and 10th-place finishes to show for it. Honorable Mentions: Jason Day ($10,100) and Brooks Koepka ($10,200)  I am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is matt13jones) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on. Although I have expressed my personal view on the games and strategies above, they do not necessarily reflect the view(s) of DraftKings and I may also deploy different players and strategies than what I recommend above.
1600	1600	14	14	target: Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm hoping Stallings' form lasts another week as I'm e/w on him, Henley &amp; Murray (long shot) at the Honda Classic. #golf #bettingtips
11582	11582	16	17	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think most will avoid because of the names around him and last week. Tier 2  Adam Hadwin $7,500 – Another guy who played well at the Genesis. He didn’t play here last year, but I like what I saw a couple weekends ago.
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
45	45	12	13	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, let’s get into the picks for the week. Top Tier ($12,200-11,000)  Jim Furyk $11,000: The man with a swing that was once described as being akin to “an octopus falling out of a tree” is making his first post 58 debuts here at the Wyndham. Furyk has made 92% of his cuts here and finished 9th the last time here in 2011.
6495	6495	19	20	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGATOUR.COM fantasy columnist Rob Bolton lists his five against-the-grain selections for this week's event at the Old White TPC. Scott Brown … Back in action after a three-week break that supplanted seven straight weeks of competition. He hit that road trip running with a playoff loss teaming with Kevin Kisner in New Orleans.
1820	1820	12	12	target: Castro: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Fire him up at $7,000.
9725	9725	2	3	target: Daniel Berger, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glue Guys    Daniel Berger, $16,300    In each of his first three seasons on the PGA Tour, Berger has grossed over $3 million, an uncommon feat. But somehow, Berger has remained under the radar despite his success. Don’t let Berger go unnoticed in your lineups this week as a glue guy who will make the cut and more.
3838	3838	33	34	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The experience building a lineup is very different, but you still need to identify guys you like in every price range – so here are a few names to get you started. High-Priced  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – He is expensive, his price tag identifying him as the clear class of the weekend, but he could be worth it if he keeps up his current level of play. If he is playing at his best, there is no one standing between him and at least a top-10 showing, making him a great option in any contest format.
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
10817	10817	17	18	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Its pretty much the antithesis to last week’s event from a TV standpoint. Golfers to Consider:  $16,000+  Dustin Johnson ($17,100)  The best player on the planet, there’s just no questioning it. Off the tee, he’s going to be in position to score almost every single time.
2813	2813	21	22	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Expect Na to be in contention on Sunday just like he was in 2014 when he finished solo second. Taras Pitra: Graham DeLaet ($8,400)  It's tough to ignore what he's been doing this year (10th, 17th, 9th, 54th). Being ranked near the top of the tour in putting is the main reason we're seeing him near the top of the leaderboard.
11167	11167	22	22	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's ranked a decent 74th in driving accuracy but a spectacular second in greens in regulation. That last part is important, since Woodland is not a great scrambler. Woodland was co-runner-up here last year and is coming off a win three weeks ago at Phoenix.
3326	3326	2	2	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bonus statistics: Rickie is 7th in Par 4 Scoring and 1st in Scrambling. We will be riding the Fowler wave this week. Paul Casey ($7,800) – This is simply a misprice.
434	434	36	36	target: Patrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While this is as good as it gets in these tournaments, I feel like the obvious choice has been faltering over the last few tournaments with sure bets landing into the 30-50th in the standings. B:  Patrick Reed - Currently 1st in the FedEx rankings, Patrick had a very strong start, faltered a bit in the middle but now has had top 15 finishes in 5 out of 6 tournaments. He finished 4th at TPC Boston last year.
11475	11475	27	27	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But we view that as an outlier, especially after Fleetwood's Mexico runner-up a year ago and solo fourth last week at the Honda. Tier 2 Values    Phil Mickelson - $9,300 (20-1)  We've really been slow to join the Mickelson Bandwagon. But after three straight top-6s, including at Riviera, it's time to get on the bandwagon or risk being run over by it.
1546	1546	11	11	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Decided to just do 2 ew doubles this week. Crocker/Johnston into Walker
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.
6803	6803	70	71	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To cater to higher-caliber players, a convenient Sunday night charter flight is available to those qualifying for Royal Birkdale; 15 players in the field have already qualified, but one additional berth awaits the highest top-5 finisher who hasn’t already punched their ticket to Royal Birkdale. Prior Decade Champions    2016 – Ryan Moore  2015 – Jordan Spieth  2014 – Brian Harman  2013 – Jordan Spieth  2012 – Zach Johnson  2011 – Steve Stricker  2010 – Steve Stricker  2009 – Steve Stricker  2008 – Kenny Perry  2007 – Jonathan Byrd    Key Stats to Winning at TPC Deere Run    • Driving Accuracy  • Proximity to Hole  • Birdie-or-Better Percentage    Champion’s Profile    The list of champions points to many class acts with multiple PGA Tour wins, namely Spieth, Johnson, and Stricker. The key takeaway is the top players in a weak field fare quite well, but plenty of dark horses have contended here in the past.
1594	1594	8	8	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Wow. Even with a nasty backslide on Sunday, Rahm still did what Rahm does best and birdied his way back to even par on the day. He’s just a sensational talent and an excellent candidate to find his first win this season.
10540	10540	20	20	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar is making his first PGA TOUR starts of 2018 so that is also a pass for me. With Z. Johnson always safe for a good finish at TPC Deere Run, I will save him for now and choose Daniel Berger. Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team for each DFS site, per week.
6324	6324	16	17	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a risky play given the year-to-date, but he’s been hitting approaches and putting better recently. Zac Blair ($7000) – On any course where accuracy matters more than distance, Blair has to be considered; the little Mormon hits 68.85% of fairways (15 th ) but struggles with longer distances – luckily with long approach shots (above 200), he’s 46 th on Tour and 20 th from 200-225. He’s not without his flaws, but he gains strokes on the greens, scores very well on par-3s (four of them on this course) and averages only 4.02 on par-4s.  )
123	123	27	28	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Very much a form horse who thrives on Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix greens and whose tee-to-green game - and scrambling - is top notch right now. RESULT: MC  Bubba Watson 1pt EW 45/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  So the blueprint for Bethpage Black is for longer hitters who are hitting plenty of greens and who like Poa Annua. Step forward Bubba Watson whose career results look very similar to 2012 victor Nick Watney.
1521	1521	1	1	target: @ollie_gt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Think @ollie_gt is worth a bet at 54/1 in the #GenesisOpen. Schniederjans took to Riviera on his first start at the… https://t.co/9KvYiUELGc
5360	5360	37	37	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
11180	11180	26	27	target: Ryan Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Take your shots where you feel confident, especially if a guy is known to play well in Florida but hasn’t performed in the past few outings. Ryan Palmer ($7.3K) – I am a supporter of Team Palmer this year and will likely be firing him up anytime he is under $8K this year until he wins. So, like I said, I’m not biased.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
6606	6606	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He can be tilting to follow live so I don’t recommend watching every shot. However, at this price Finau can allow you to avoid having to punt in cash games. Danny Lee ($16,400) – A former winner at this event, Danny Lee is riding a hot streak.
1613	1613	15	15	target: Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The idea that Torrey Pines should suit his length and all-round skills isn't just theoretical. Swafford teed it up in this event last year and was T13. There is actually a precedent for a player scoring a first breakthrough Tour win and coming to Torrey and shining again.
11569	11569	29	30	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As for the weather, expect near-perfect scoring conditions with sunny skies for a majority of the week, high temperatures reaching 80 degrees and very little wind. Past Champions    2017- Dustin Johnson  2016 - Adam Scott  2015 - Dustin Johnson  2014 - Patrick Reed  2013 - Tiger Woods  2012 - Justin Rose  2011 - Nick Watney  2010 - Ernie Els  2009 - Phil Mickelson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop    Dustin Johnson - $17,900    The defending champion was victorious at the inaugural WGC-Mexico Championship held at the Club de Golf Chapultepec last year, and he’s maintained the No. 1 spot in the OWGR ever since.
9969	9969	2	2	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Jon Rahm – All Formats – DK: $11800 FD: $12500  It seems almost unfair to write about picking the top player in the field but there is no way I can shy away from Rahm this week. Despite being the clear favourite of the field Jon Rahm’s price is not overly inflated and he is only a few hundred more than the second price players (Harman and Phil(why?)) on DraftKings and FanDuel respectively.
10986	10986	13	14	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be decently low owned with all the names in this range. Bubba Watson $7,800 – Pretty good price for a guy who has won here twice. He is getting some form back, so I will try and hop on before he is super chalk.
5178	5178	28	28	target: Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kuchar ranks 32nd in SG:T2G, 37th in Par 4 Scoring, and 11th in Scrambling. With both recent form and course history, there’s a lot to like here with Kuchar. Tony Finau ($15,300) – I fully expect Finau to be chalky this week.
12866	12866	5	5	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott. He has made the cut every year since 2010 and posted four Top 10s in his past seven starts there.
8938	8938	3	4	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Emiliano Grillo  7. Luke List  8. Kevin Na  9.
10252	10252	12	13	target: Jhonattan Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like Brendan in cash or GPP lineups. Embed from Getty Images  Jhonattan Vegas $7,700 – Jhonny V is in tremendous form coming off a solid week at the CareerBuilder where he continued making birdies in bunches. Like Steele, he’s gained 19 strokes on the field in the last five years at Torrey Pines.
192	192	86	87	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The other surprise name here is Nick Taylor, which tells us as much as we need to know about the strength of this event. Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.
8844	8844	29	29	target: Simpson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not expecting another top-5, but anything inside the top 12 is reasonable and you'll probably need him to finish high in GPPs this week. -- Taras Pitra  Webb Simpson  In his four appearances at East Lake, Simpson has been able to finish in the top 5 twice. Since he changed his putter this season, he has been a much improved player and has three top-10 finishes in his past four events played.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
316	316	22	23	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
2188	2188	28	29	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows.
11016	11016	27	27	target: Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are so many solid values in the $7K range on DraftKings this week that ownership will be somewhat diluted and spread out. We are rolling with Hahn in GPPs and cash games with zero hesitation. In fact, Hahn may be as low as we would go in cash given the lack of firepower in the $6K range.
10898	10898	62	63	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've now witnessed three three-man playoffs in three of the last six years at Riviera and prior to the last two results, the previous four winners had all been at least a couple of strokes back with a round to go so it's a great place to trade on a Sunday. In 2015, Sergio Garcia was matched at a low of [1.4], Dustin Johnson hit [1.38], and Paul Casey dipped to [1.85]. All three were beaten!
2601	2601	1	2	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Middling  Phil Mickelson: $7,600  Mickelson's ability to make birdies always makes him a GPP consideration. And while his reputation is as a great scrambler and putter, Mickelson was fifth on tour in strokes gained: approach the green last year. He's sixth on tour in birdie average this season.
9964	9964	4	4	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This short list includes Rahm, Mickelson, Harman, Kisner, Reed, and Simpson. Though anyone can emerge in an event like this, it would be a tragedy to not have at least one of the top 6 salaried players rostered this week. In any case, par-breakers are a must, so target guys who have shown recent low scores or perennially have proven they can go low.
11363	11363	6	7	target: Jon Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Winds are modest. The Leading Contenders  Jon Rahm  Rahm teed off last year as a World No. 37 with immense promise.
1338	1338	0	0	target: Harkins 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Harkins 6.8k - playing really well right now. Only 1 MC in his PGA tour starts. B2B T15s, Long off the tee, seems t… https://t.co/bCLOuOxlkh
8188	8188	11	11	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll be playing Scott in GPP and Cash contests confidently. Daniel Berger $7,700 – Berger is a bomber and is playing some great golf right now. He has recorded three Top 5’s in his past six PGA Tour events and has missed only four cuts in 17 starts this season.
281	281	3	3	target: Knox, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
8189	8189	20	20	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The FSU album is one of the best iron players in the game over the last 12-24 rounds he’s played. Berger has played Quail Hollow twice including no missed cuts and a Top 25. This is a bomber’s course and Berger has the length to compete and win.
2255	2255	31	31	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson’s 76.4 Recent GIR percentage is good enough for 10th, and his 68.2 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks ninth among golfers with more than one start in the past six weeks. Johnson is currently the No. 1 golfer in the Colin Davy Player Model.
6520	6520	24	25	target: Johnson Wagner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His recent form is some of the best in the field: 12th, 25th, 5th, and 13th place finishes in his last four starts. Steals  Johnson Wagner ($7,700)  With harder pricing this week, I don’t think many people will target this range of golfers. If you do want to be contrarian in GPPs, Johnson Wagner is the most obvious play.
383	383	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good luck this week! High End Targets ($9,000+)  Jason Day  Vegas Odds - 8/1  Draftkings - $12,500  FantasyAces - $6,200  What stood out to me more than anything last week was how awful Jason Day was off the tee(35% Driv Acc and ranked 72nd in SG:OTT) yet he was still able to finish T4 shooting a seven under par. Despite having to hit out of the rough for the majority of the four days he still had close to a 70% GIR(ranked T19) and led the field in SG:Putting.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
2489	2489	9	9	target: Schwartzel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			His poor start to 2017 has been curious. Firstly, Schwartzel finished 2016 with third spot at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai and then took fourth in December's Alfred Dunhill Championship. He looked primed to start the new year fast.
1358	1358	2	2	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@WMPhoenixOpen Picks Berger 40 Chappell 66 Hoffman 66 Piercy 75 Ollie 80 *Fowler 16 w. Patriots ML (-175) al… https://t.co/tlRzw6qW6U
861	861	17	18	target: Scott Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With that being said, let’s get on to the sleeper picks of the week. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Scott Piercy ($9,700)  My main concern with Piercy is going to be the fact that he’s traveling from China, but hopefully he has a day off in between. He’s your prototypical desert golfer: born and raised in Las Vegas, and went to school at San Diego State.
5718	5718	43	43	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a proven wind player with two wins at The Qatar Masters in the windy Doha Golf Club, a win at Harbour Town Golf Links at the RBC Heritage in 2016 and a T13 this year at The Sony Open in Hawaii. Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency.
1039	1039	47	48	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is my thought process on week 6 of the 2016-17 campaign: First I want to look at tournament history. Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts: Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN) Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41) Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2) Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33) Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18) Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25) Jim Furyk (T11-3) Robert Streb (WIN-T25) Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9) Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  Each week I think aloud to provide you with my One-and-Done selection as well as a few alternatives. Fade or Follow?
10952	10952	21	22	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brandon Harkins $6,800 – I could see him being the highest owned guy below $7,000, but he is playing very well. Adam Hadwin $7,100 – He is interesting to me because he has made 3 straight cuts here and hasn’t missed one on Tour since late August. Will probably go largely overlooked.
12541	12541	44	44	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price. Other values: Sean O’Hair ($7200)  Good luck this week!
9710	9710	17	17	target: Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
316	316	22	23	target: Jordan Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We like Jimmy in GPP contests on DraftKings, but don’t plan on dipping this low in our cash lineups. Player to avoid:  Jordan Spieth $12,000 – We always try to tell you a guy to avoid here that will actually give you an ownership edge if he sucks. Therefore, we give you Jordan Spieth this week.
382	382	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He doesn't seem to get mentioned as much as the five players ahead of him and this could be to our benefit this week. Scott hasn't missed a cut on tour this year and has picked up multiple wins for the third time in his career. Looking at the stats he is elite in many areas including Proximity(3rd), Par 4 Scoring(14th), Par 5 Scoring(12th), SG:APP(1st), SG:T2G(1st), BoB%(10th).
13024	13024	2	3	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: MC  Zach Johnson 1pt EW 125/1 with *For the latest bet365 Opening Account Offer details see below. Major Championships aren't won on spreadsheets but Zach Johnson's PGA Tour stats are eye-catching to say the least. The 2007 Masters Champion sits 12th in Scoring Average, 4th in Bogey Avoidance, 25th in Birdie or Better Conversion, 15th in par-4 Scoring Average and 13th in par-5 Scoring Average.
1842	1842	69	70	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Standard eligibility rankings apply, whilst the following shall first be eligible:  AT&T Pebble Beach winners prior to 2000 and in the last five seasons The Players Championship and major championship winners prior to 2000 and in the last five years  In addition there is no Open Monday Qualifying for this event. Headlining the field is World No.1, Jason Day who is also joined by Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed from the world’s top-10. Day and Johnson will be looking for much better performances than they managed at Torrey Pines two weeks ago, as both players missed the cut in an event they were rightly favourites for.
5488	5488	4	5	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be awesome. Berhow: Dustin Johnson wins at five under, Justin Rose is the runner-up for the second straight major and Mr. Lee Westwood is third. Zak: I've convinced myself that Jason Day will continue his recent solid form and that Erin Hills will play very similar to Whistling Straits (at least for him).
8213	8213	13	13	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has made seven straight cuts with four top-16 finishes entering this week. Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone?
976	976	24	25	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It has two par 5’s, four par 3’s and 12 par 4’s. Previous winners include Heath Slocum (2010), Ben Crane (2011), Tommy Gainey (2012), Chris Kirk (2013), Robert Streb (2014) and Kevin Kisner (2015). The main thing that stands out here is that length is not important, however SGP, greens in regulation and par 4 scoring stats are certainly worth mentioning.
5460	5460	5	5	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.

Chapultepec: Winner: Dustin Johnson; EW Places: Rahm, Thomas, Mickelson, Snedeker. Montreux: Winner: Chris Stroud; EW Places: Werenski, Hoge, Fathauer, Garrigus.
6401	6401	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chez Reavie is three for three here, too: T18 in 2011, T62 in 2013, and T22 in 2015. Graham DeLaet has made all four cuts at the Greenbrier (T45 in 2010, T12 in 2012, T30 in 2013, and T37 in 2015). Kevin Na has also made all four cuts of his Greenbrier career: T36 in 2010, T7 in 2012, T52 in 2014, and T32 in 2015.
1456	1456	36	37	target: Bill Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not. The secondary strength of the field is getting propped up by Francesco Molinari, Scott Piercy, Zach Johnson, Kevin Kisner, Bill Haas, William McGirt, and Kevin Na. Decent names, nothing great.
1604	1604	38	38	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's teed it up four times so far on this wraparound schedule and finished 8-27-13 before Christmas and also T9 in last week's CareerBuilder Challenge. The stats show he's been hitting it long and straight in recent times, Laird finishing 8th in Driving Accuracy last week and 2nd and 12th in DA before that. Allied to his length, it makes him a powerful proposition on this course.
10923	10923	15	15	target: DJ's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best of the Best  Dustin Johnson (FanDuel Price: $12,900 | bet365 Win Odds: 5/1) - DJ's form at Riviera alone put him in the conversation this week. Since 2009, Johnson has finished 10th, 3rd, cut, 4th, cut, 2nd, 2nd, 4th, 1st. Pair that with the fact that he's the world's number-one ranked golfer, and he's a really tough fade.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
51	51	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lipsky &amp; Canizares in Switzerland and Reed and Woodland in the US for me this week. #golf #betting #tips
1668	1668	17	17	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ also ranked 26th in SG:App last season which helped him rank third overall in tee-to-green strokes. Johnson is coming in hot after finishing runner-up at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship last week and sixth in the Tournament of Champions three weeks ago. He was 13th at the Farmers last season and finished third in 2011.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
3880	3880	16	16	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Horschel is 43rd in driving distance and 50th in scoring average. The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Horschel clearly loves this course and he’s kind of due for a victory since his last one coming in the 2014 Tour Championship.
5455	5455	15	15	target: Cink: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a great play from pedigree, recent form, course history, and key stats standpoints. Stewart Cink: $8,000  Cink arrives on the strength of top-25 finishes in three of his last four starts. He’s never missed the cut at the FedEx St. Jude.
12384	12384	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
1017	1017	16	17	target: Kevin Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk has done everything but win this fall and is a former champ. Also like: Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world. Kevin Chappell has gone lower every year and Russell Henley has no problem going low in this part of the world.
1846	1846	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed 33/1 (Betfred, Boylesports & StanJames) 1pt e/w:  I am hoping that after pulling out before the off at Torrey Pines and finishing just 68th last week, that Reed is in the right mind frame to contend, at a course he clearly loves. In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here.
3665	3665	20	20	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Donald’s most recent win came in Japan back in 2013, and whilst he has not won in America since 2012, Fitzpatrick can certainly draw inspiration from his career so far. Fitzpatrick tweeted Monday evening saying “Now onto my favourite week of the year @RBC_Heritage”. Whether it be the fact he finished so well here as an amateur three years ago or just the fact they invited him during his time as amateur, who knows, but it can only be a positive that he speaks so highly of the event.
13181	13181	4	5	target: Austin Cook, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			the RSM Classic winner, Austin Cook, is an interesting debutant at a big price and Kevin Streelman, who currently ranks third for Scrambling and second for GIR, was third here in 2013. Selections:  Cameron Smith @ [34.0]  William McGirt @ [90.0]  Si Woo Kim @ [120.0]  Austin Cook @ an average of [148.0]  Kevin Streelman @ an average of [160.0]    I'll be later with my Open de Espana preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
3811	3811	36	37	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Morgan Hoffmann ($7,000): With local ties to the area and a recent career-best at the Honda Classic, Hoffmann has a lot of potential but I'm keeping on the front end since he's not the safest option. Jason Dufner ($8,300): Is playing steady golf this season. He's been inside the top 30 thru 36 holes in 9 of his last 10 starts, so you know where I'll be placing him this week.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
11165	11165	14	15	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why scrambling is so important this week. last year, Rickie Fowler and co-runners-up Gary Woodland and Morgan Hoffmann all finished top-10 in scrambling. The year before, the top-8 finishers were all top-12 in scrambling.
2286	2286	20	20	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won’t be over-owned because of an egregious miss price but also provides enough upside to stomach paying that price. Casey is one of my favorite bets on the board this week at 50-1 and is my early lean for a One and Done selection. Brandt Snedeker – $7,600  Your free space for the week is Brandt Snedeker.
10801	10801	25	26	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Update: With a weather draw potentially favoring golfers that play Spyglass on Saturday, I'm going to make a late change. My new pick will be Patrick Cantlay who ranks 30th in weighted course history but ranks 9th over long-term skill. He ranks #2 behind Jon Rahm (already used) when isolating golfers that will play Splyglass on Saturday.
8009	8009	17	17	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Holmes is a past winner at Quail Hollow with his triumph in the 2014 Wells Fargo Championship. Holmes isn’t in the greatest of form, but he has two top-15 finishes in his last four starts, with a 14th at the RBC Canadian Open and a ninth at the Greenbrier Classic. He had two good rounds at Firestone in the WGC-Bridgestone, including a final-round 67 to get a silver lining out of a bad weekend.
902	902	26	26	target: Randolph 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back in a big way this week after a bit of hiatus, S/O to @FantasyJesusDFS for the stats! 💰💰💰 CHoff 33 An 40 🎯🎯🎯 Beau 125 Randolph 125
9534	9534	39	40	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Not that he'd show up, but still quite the question.) For now, we are left with a still-pretty-dang-intriguing tournament at Kapalua, with seven of the top eight in the OWGR on hand, including the top-five: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm and Hideki Matsuyama. Not too shabby.
8386	8386	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama. Whilst Day couldn’t get the job done on his last start, I think he has shown enough to contend again, at a course he should enjoy. Despite Day seemingly struggling for most of the season, Day still ranks a very impressive 2nd in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green and that is particularly pleasing ahead of this event.
11505	11505	28	29	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On that note, Casey ranks 6th in the field in DK scoring putting him just below favorites like DJ, Rahm, and JT but at a much cheaper value. Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself.
16	16	15	16	target: Harold Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
2314	2314	4	5	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic  Defending Champ: Adam Scott  FNTSY Sports Network’s Pat Mayo & Derek Farnsworth discuss their favorite Honda Classic DraftKings picks. The guys preview the course, debate the best roster construction for the week and explain which players are best suited for DFS cash games and which should be deployed in guaranteed prize pool (GPP) tournaments. Honda Classic Field  144 Players | Top 70 & Ties After 36-Holes Make the Cut  The PGA’s shift from the West Coast to the East means we’re dealing with new types of grass, different gusts of winds, and, most importantly, the removal of the Thursday safety net for filling out our lineups.
11939	11939	20	20	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kizzire has taken 11 events, whilst Thomas has done it in just 8, but it is an impressive effort nonetheless. Kizzire missed the cut on debut here last year, but as stated earlier mediocre course form can be overcome, it is the experience that is vital. Returning a better player this time around, Kizzire will be keen to improve in an event that could well suit now his game is in better shape.
10578	10578	19	19	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His game has also been pretty hot in the last few months. While not as potent as Simpson here, Johnson has top 15s the last three years in Phoenix. He’s subtly been one of the most high-producing consistent golfers in the world of late, with finishes between T-8 and T-23 in his last six starts.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.
10971	10971	16	17	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
537	537	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cut out the errors and it could be his weekend, no ideal for Darren Clarke. Patrick Reed has started the last few events but not been able to see them through and if he can hold firm under pressure after a decent start he will give himself a great chance and after some poor final rounds it is safe to say he will be looking to prove a point. Our four top picks for this weekend:  Rory McIlroy £15M    Patrick Reed £14.5M  Russell Knox £12M  Ryan Moore £9.5M  Last Five Winners  2015 - Jason Day -22  2014 - Billy Horschel -14  2013 - Zach Johnson -16  2012 - Rory McIlroy -20  2011 - Justin Rose -13
708	708	14	14	target: Poston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			100 to 1 bets that should peak your interest Danny Lee Cam Smith JT Poston Scott Piercy
10543	10543	9	10	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the short list of truths to be self-evident, Hideki Matsuyama at the Waste Management Phoenix Open appears. No, the history doesn't predict the present, but we compete in an imperfect fantasy world. This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident.
12272	12272	52	52	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He already has a win at Torrey Pines followed by a T2 at Pebble Beach to his name this year though, so I have no concerns about his form in general. A two-time winner of this event, who has already won this year it is incredibly easy to make a case for Day and that’s why I will not go on for too long. Form figures of 1-T2-T22 in 2018 suggest he is in fine form, despite some average iron play, so he can easily win an event he loves, in a format he dominates.
11571	11571	36	36	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson’s natural power should allow for him to combat the tight fairways with plenty of long irons off the tee as he won’t need driver to keep up. Tommy Fleetwood - $16,400    Fleetwood was runner-up to Johnson by just one stroke at the WGC-Mexico Championship in 2017, despite missing the cut in two of his three starts prior to the event. This time around, he’s up to a career-best 11th in the OWGR and has finished top-six five times in his last six starts.
577	577	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week. Reed may be this cheap due to a 19th and 27th in his 2 starts at East Lake, but I feel that if DJ isn’t winning this tournament, Reed is the guy who will.
3803	3803	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The following is the top 10 in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round over the last two years: Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Bill Haas, Branden Grace, Kevin Na, Martin Kaymer, Ryan Palmer, Marc Leishman, and Brandt Snedeker). Golfers that raise the flag for course history and long-term skill include: Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar, Branden Grace, and Kevin Na. While Furyk and Grace are the past two champs here, they aren't playing up to their standards right now, so I will pass.
11765	11765	2	2	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since. However, the lack of recent play does not concern me with one of the worlds elite at a course that should play right into Stenson’s style.
7022	7022	14	14	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this cheap price tag, Luck is the perfect GPP play this week. Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events.
744	744	25	25	target: Berger/Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			No clue what sort of Zurich exposure I will have .. Looking forward to see how they price the field but I want ALL the Berger/Pieters
48	48	1	1	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: neutral			Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course. As for Rahm, I’m going to keep picking him until he wins – and he’s getting awfully close.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.
1560	1560	6	6	target: Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Last pre-event #GenesisOpen bet: FRL - Saunders @125s - 0.65pts e/w 15th last year on BoB% on par 4s and has a ha… https://t.co/5KqA1LAPT0
12889	12889	26	27	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Summary of Bets  The Masters  Jordan Spieth – 3pts ew @ 10/1 (1/5 odds 8 places Betfair SB) and 3pts win @ 12.0 on Betfair Exchange  Jason Day – 1.5pts ew @ 16/1 (1/5 odds 10 places Skybet)  Matt Kuchar – 1pt ew @ 35/1 (SkyBet) and 2pts Top 10 @ 5.0 on Betfair  Brendan Steele – 0.5pt ew @ 125/1 (Skybet) and 3pts Top 20 @ 11/2  Zach Johnson – 0.5pt ew @ 100/1 (Skybet)  Hideki Matsuyama – 3pts Top 10 @ 10/3  Weekly pts advised = 24pts The stand-out 10/3 looks very tempting indeed for a player who hasn’t finished outside the top 11 the last three years. While I’m not sure he will ever win this I am sure he will rack up the top 10s with his towering, accurate approach play ideal for holding these fast greens.
5191	5191	22	22	target: Scott: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day’s 62.1 LT SC percentage ranks fourth, and he is tied for sixth overall with his 15.1 LT Adj Bird Avg. Adam Scott: Scott hasn’t played here since 2014, when he finished fourth. Scott’s 70.7 LT GIR percentage is fourth, and his 15.0 LT Adj Bird Avg is eighth.
12352	12352	0	1	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Cantlay  Ben Coley provides a group-by-group guide to the WGC-Match Play Championship, with three each-way bets recommended. Group 1 Dustin Johnson  Kevin Kisner  Adam Hadwin  Bernd Wiesberger The draw for the defending champion could hardly have been kinder. Of the players in Pool B, few have been struggling as badly as Kevin Kisner of late - the fact that these struggles have taken place on courses so well suited to his game is particularly disconcerting.
12109	12109	8	8	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That is the obvious risk you take whenever Scott finds his way onto your roster. However, if his ball striking is back to a place where we expect Scott to be, the putter will show up on occasion and you have to take your shots with him. Scott has three made cuts at Arnie’s tournament, including a 3rd place finish in 2014.
108	108	7	8	target: Brett Stegmaier 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shriner's Open bets: E/W Adam Hadwin 125-1 Brett Stegmaier 300-1 FRL Ricky Barnes 125-1
113	113	8	9	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Brooks Koepka  Mid Tier $9,500-7,500  Matt Kuchar ($9,200): The Kuch is back in the states, riding the patriotic wave from his Bronze medal performance in Rio. Kuchar is a tailor-made cash play here as usual. Solid form, solid event history, and solid stats for the course, what’s not to love about the Kuch?
8166	8166	7	7	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other Options: Jon Rahm    Mid-Tier Plays    Adam Scott (DK: $8,600, FD: $8,400)    Adam Scott is a tee-to-green master and has been scoring consistent but not spectacular results all season. The worry with Scott is how awful his putter is, but with reports being that these greens are lightning fast, we may see the entire field struggle making putts. He also has a nice narrative since he is expecting a child shortly after the event, so this should be his final tournament of the season.
2393	2393	17	18	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Great price, cash worthy. Economy  Billy Horschel $7,200  Nick Watney $7,100  Kyle Stanley $7,100  Martin Flores $7,100  Stewart Cink $7,100  That’s it for this week. I think it is a great week to focus on cash games and build some bankroll.
595	595	5	5	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rec Adj Birdies: 17.3, Patrick Reed ($9,000)  DJ leads all players in this metric, but Reed in next in line among players in this range of salaries. Reed started the playoffs in fashion, with a victory at The Barclays and a fifth-place finish at the Deutsche Bank Championship. He finished 13th at the BMW Championship two weeks ago despite hitting only 56 percent of his greens and 42 percent of his fairways in regulation.
282	282	4	4	target: Vegas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on Knox, Vegas &amp; Brown in Honda Classic this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
5226	5226	9	10	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Jason Dufner – $8,700  Duf-man was a very popular pick last week at the Dean and Deluca. He was highly owned across all formats and even in one and done pools.
6628	6628	20	21	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Because of that dynamic, ownership levels are projected to be fairly even among many of the high-priced guys. Not until James Hahn at $8,800 on DraftKings — he has the 14th-highest salary in the field — do we find someone projected for potential single-digit ownership at nine to 12 percent. Sung Kang is the first golfer below that; he’s $8,600 and is currently projected for five to eight percent ownership.
1548	1548	38	38	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Steele placed sixth at the Tournament of Champions two weeks ago has solid history at the CareerBuilder, finishing 34th in 2016 and runner-up in 2015. With the way the pricing works this week, you can fit Steele and Johnson in the same lineup and still build a nice team. That should be a great approach as this is a good "studs and duds" week.
890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
4330	4330	0	1	target: Shane Lowry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry … Let's try this again. His last appearance on this page was for the Masters but his putter didn't cooperate as was the need. Four weeks later, strong putting is neutralized in the context of unfamiliar surfaces.
8491	8491	22	22	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He gained 1.37 and 3.22 strokes respectively on the field in those two tournaments so there are only positives to be taken. Reed plays this year's FedEx Cup opener on the back of his best ever performance in a major - tied second in the PGA Championship - so his already unwavering confidence levels will be even higher. The good thing with the American is that he's not settling for what he's got.
8334	8334	26	27	target: Trey Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Watney feels like more of a GPP play, but if you’re playing in large cash game contests, we wouldn’t mind the move. Best bargain basement option:  Trey Mullinax $6,900 – Mullinax doesn’t necessarily fit the profile for Sedgefield from a stats perspective since he’s a bomb and gouge type guy. However, Trey is a sneaky good putter and proved that all year last year on the Web.com tour.
8214	8214	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker (125-1): Defending champ won on a soaked Baltusrol last year. With more rain expected this year, why not take a chance with Walker, who has made four straight cuts and contended early last week at Firestone? Jamie Lovemark (150-1): Seems to be made for majors this season – T-27 at U.S. Open and T-22 at British Open this year.
1151	1151	3	4	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			MY PICK : Henrik Stenson ($9,400)  It’s hard to pick one player to stand out from what is basically an all star field of golfers this week. Still, I do see this as an opportunity for Henrik Stenson to end his already amazing 2016 with a bang. Stenson won the Open Championship in maybe the most brilliant display of golf in a major ever, nearly won the Olympic gold and was just his usual cool self all year.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!
3874	3874	9	10	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open Picks (Yahoo! Game)  Brendan Steele & Branden Grace – On the heels of an impressive Sunday at The Heritage, Grace seems to have finally righted his game. As will be the theme with many of the picks this week, the South African dominates off the tee and with his irons, but is lost on the greens.
828	828	14	14	target: WEBB 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
5459	5459	0	1	target: Phil Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
8986	8986	23	24	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We head overseas for a smaller field event in the CIMB Classic. This event has been dominated by two men in recent years, Justin Thomas and Ryan Moore. With the shortened field, cash is not recommended, but it is certainly still an option, especially if there’s overlay.
423	423	29	30	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			9. Emiliano Grillo, Argentina -- The 23-year-old probably wrapped up the 2016 Rookie of the Year Award on the PGA Tour last week when he tied for second behind Patrick Reed in his FedEx Cup playoffs debut at The Barclays. Grillo, who won the season-opening Frys.com Open in a playoff over Kevin Na in October, has added nine finishes in the top 25 this season and ranks sixth in the point standings heading into the Deutsche Bank Championship.
3829	3829	11	11	target: Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But the Brit returns to action at arguably his best course. Donald has never won at Harbour Town, but he has four runner-ups and two thirds. Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well.
1522	1522	0	0	target: CHOI 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CHOI has an impeccable record at Riviera. https://t.co/iNGBsDFpIs
3918	3918	0	1	target: John Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			John Peterson 200/1 (General) 0.5pt e/w:  I put Peterson up for the other event in his home state, the Shell Houston Open, just for him to withdraw before the off, but I like chances that bit more here, at the same price. Last week, Peterson turned up to the RBC Heritage off the back of some travelling issues and a weekend in Vegas, but this time the father-to-be looks to be in better focus. In a reply to a tweet effectively asking him if there will be any pre-tournament distractions this week, he stated “Nah.
1062	1062	6	6	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First @SonyOpenHawaii bet is Si Woo Kim at 66/1. Kim finished fourth on sole course start in 2016 and could benefit… https://t.co/2vHlNe7IgC
2357	2357	1	1	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall, Grace has finished no worse than 32nd in his last four events and seems to be getting better each tournament he plays. Grace is also 37th in greens in regulation percentage. There’s also the fact seven of the last nine winners of the Honda Classic weren’t from the United States.
9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.
731	731	6	6	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Valero Texas Open bets: Moore 25-1 Palmer 50-1 An 50-1 List 60-1 Lovemark 100-1 Flores 225-1
570	570	5	6	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5. Emiliano Grillo - $6,900  6.
11241	11241	28	28	target: "Poulter 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking to back outsiders in this week's golf tournaments? Paul Krishnamurty has scoured the list of players available at 99-1 or more, recommending three picks and some alternatives...  "Poulter is always worth considering when in Florida, where he has a home. His record on Bermuda greens is excellent and he's contended strongly for most of the Florida Swing events.
6979	6979	17	17	target: Hoffman’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With only 15 tags on FanShareSports, he has the third fewest out of anyone priced above $9K. Hoffman’s recent form is incredible, with an 8th place finish at the U.S. Open followed by a T3 at the Travelers. Maybe it only took a couple weeks off to forget what Charley has been up to?
2603	2603	27	27	target: Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
856	856	19	19	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RFO - Jeremy Chapman - @THEPLAYERSChamp 2.5ew Garcia 18-1; 1ew Thomas 35-1, Matsuyama 25-1; 0.5ew Chappell 60-1, Fowler 22-1, Scott 45-1
5461	5461	6	6	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total. Roster the veteran in this weak field event.
12704	12704	54	55	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is also live coverage on BBC2 on Saturday and Sunday, and they also have Red Button coverage from mid-afternoon over the weekend, showing featured groups, Amen Corner, and holes 15 and 16. Last Ten Winners  2017 - Sergio Garcia -9 (playoff)  2016 - Danny Willett -5  2015 - Jordan Spieth -18  2014 - Bubba Watson -8  2013 - Adam Scott -9 (playoff)  2012 - Bubba Watson -10 (playoff)  2011 - Charl Schwartzel -14  2010 - Phil Mickelson -16  2009 - Angel Cabrera -12 (playoff)  2008 - Trevor Immelman -8  What Will it Take to Win the US Masters? Sergio Garcia's stats were incredible last year and it's hardly surprising he won.
1003	1003	7	8	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 RSM Classic top 10 picks  1. Chris Kirk - He won on Sea Island in 2013, and he's been brilliant through this six-event run of the season. 2.
5504	5504	59	60	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As an indication of how little change there is, look at the state of affairs last year after rounds one and three... Round One  Andrew Landry -4  Dustin Johnson -3  Lee Westwood -3  Shane Lowry -2  Sergio Garcia -2  Scott Piercy -2    Round Three  Shane Lowry -7  Andrew Landry -3  Dustin Johnson -3  Lee Westwood -2  Daniel Summerhays -2  Branden Grace -1  Sergio Garcia level par  Scott Piercy level par    Since as far back as 1898, no winner has been further back at halfway than Simpson, who sat tied for 29th and still six off the lead. He's the only winner in the last 11 years to be outside the top-three places after 36 holes and he's the only winner to be outside the top-12 at halfway since Larry Nelson back in 1983.
11904	11904	19	20	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is quite a specialised event so strong results on Florida-type courses are essential. My selections are as follows:  Tiger Woods 4pts Win 7/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim here:  Tiger Woods with Florida form of 12/2 just has to be backed for his first PGA Tour win since 2013 here at Bay Hill where he's won the title across 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2013.
27	27	13	13	target: Huh 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WyndhamChampionship Long Shot Bets = Si Woo Kim 150/1, Reavie 175/1, Weekley 215/1, Huh 350/1
10717	10717	22	22	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why top-25s are good -- he's got four of them here in the past five years, two of them being top-10s. Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home.
617	617	6	6	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Main targets Kisner +25 Fitzpatrick +28 Horschel +35 Knox +40 Bryan +60 Wasting $$$ on B.A.D. +40 Willett +66 Bello +66 Lee +100 CAM +125
4134	4134	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau – $8,400  It’s a bombers week, so Tony Finau has to be considered especially at his reasonable $8,400 price tag. Finau has been playing solid this season with two top 5s in his last seven events. His stats line up perfectly for this course, ranking 2nd in strokes gained off the tee plus strokes gained approach.
12014	12014	1	1	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
5160	5160	28	28	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our panel of ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have put together the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy-point totals. Picks to win  Matt Kuchar  Kuchar has played the event 11 times and his average in relation to par over four rounds is -8.1. That might not seem great, but because of that average he ranks fourth on the tournament's all-time money list.
4658	4658	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I guess it is suitable for Finau as he has finished 10th and 12th in his only attempts at this course. Finau ranks 4th in GIR%, 6th in SG:T2G, 7th in Par 4 Scoring, and 17th in BoB%. I will only be using Finau in GPPs as he is volatile in nature and can finish T10 or miss cut.
2968	2968	6	6	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Among other usual suspects are Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Brandt Snedeker and defending champion Jason Day. Rose sets up similarly to Stenson and would be my pick if Molinari wasn't available. I'd go on to gush more, but the reasoning would only further push you into plugging in the Englishman.
10732	10732	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
993	993	70	71	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The all-important wind is forecast to be in the single digits the first two days before strengthening on the weekend, to nearly 20 mph on Sunday. Key Stats to Winning at Sea Island    • Greens in regulation  • Proximity to the hole  • Scrambling  • Par 4 Birdie or better percentage (P4BOB)  • Putting average (putts per GIR)    Past Champions    2015 - Kevin Kisner  2014 - Robert Streb  2013 - Chris Kirk  2012 - Tommy Gainey  2011 - Ben Crane  2010 - Heath Slocum    Champion's Profile    Driving distance is not important. Accuracy off the tee isn't especially important.
990	990	14	15	target: Cody Gribble 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover looks to be good value here for a guy that’s bang in form. Cody Gribble 50/1  The Texan has been playing some fantastic golf so far this season with three top 15’s in his last four starts. He had a good week at The Safeway finishing T8 and didn’t shoot worse than a 70 throughout the week.
4993	4993	11	11	target: Kirk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Palmer is 10th in SGT2G. Emiliano Grillo - $7,800    As with Kirk, this is not a pick we would've made two weeks ago, but Grillo is coming off a solo 11th at The Players. He's a solid 22nd in ball striking, 24th in SGT2G, 46th in P4P and T56 in proximity.
11832	11832	46	47	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's a risky play but at a triple-figure price he's well worth the risk and last but not least, I've thrown a few pounds at the aforementioned John Deere Classic winner, Bryson DeChambeau. Selections:  Henrik Stenson @ [25.0]  Jason Dufner @ [85.0]  Ollie Schniederjans @ [95.0]  Zach Johnson @ [110.0]  Bryson DeChambeau @ [130.0]  I'll be back later with the Hero Indian Open preview. *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter
9890	9890	2	3	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: T29  Chris Kirk 1pt EW 60/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £60 - 18+, T&Cs apply. Claim here:  Chris Kirk is another who fits the bill very well this week. A player whose recent form reads 10-4 should be taken seriously, but there's plenty of juice in his price this week to include him, especially as the Georgia-based 32 year-old shot 69-66-68 to be 8th here after 54 holes 12 months ago.
621	621	3	4	target: Luke Donald, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@gfienberg17 JJ Spaun, Luke Donald, Jason Kokrak
8192	8192	10	11	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s another GPP and Cash staple for us this week. Tony Finau $7,000 – Like Berger, Finau has played Quail Hollow twice without missing a cut and landing one T25. He’s another big hitter that has played quite well in major championships including a Top-10 in the 2015 PGA Championship.
3663	3663	23	23	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fitzpatrick currently ranks T4 in Strokes-Gained: Putting, slightly ahead of Donald in 8th. I mention Donald because he graduated from Northwestern University, where Fitzpatrick enrolled for just one semester, and many have drawn comparisons between the two since the start of Fitzpatrick’s career. Donald has forged a mighty fine career for himself, reaching World No.1 in 2011 and winning 16 times as a professional.
515	515	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Doubling down on Fowler - 16/1 to win in Houston &amp; 28/1 to win The Masters. His game is without flaws right now.
3320	3320	14	14	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you really are looking for some marginal ownership spots you can expect Henrik Stenson to be lower owned than he should be as a result of his rocky play recently and WD mid round a month or so ago. With 5/5 made cuts at this event, two runner ups, and a third place finish here I plan on exploiting Stenson’s downward trend in ownership. Click To Enlarge!
10328	10328	3	3	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings bargain: Bill Haas ($7,000). His form of late has been grisly (three straight MCs), but he can get out of that funk at any time … and when he does, we know that Haas is a player worth way more than $7,000. (Haas also has a solid record at Torrey, with three top 10s at this event.)
6246	6246	23	23	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, in a weak field like this, you are forced to roster golfers in cash that you wouldn’t necessarily do in stronger fields. Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring.
7823	7823	8	8	target: Rory 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For the first time in the Levitanimal’s history, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has finished ninth or better here in four of five trips, including his win in 2014, but didn’t play here in either of the past two years. McIlroy has had a disappointing season up to this point, but he did flash some Rory-like form charging to a T4 finish at The Open Championship.
10563	10563	16	16	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh. Webb Simpson, Brendan Steele and Ryan Moore line up as safety nets if you're in the same position as our resident Aussie.
4150	4150	22	22	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
10732	10732	27	27	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Chesson Hadley, Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry  PLAY PGA DFS AT DRAFTKINGS WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE BONUS CODE! Value Tier: $7.4K and Lower  Chris Kirk ($7.1K) – Chris Kirk is having a comeback kind of year, and he has previously posted a second place at this track. This week is as good as any to fire up Kirk.
439	439	4	4	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format. Nine of his last eleven rounds have been in the 60's, and he has the highest strokes gained total on average in FEC events since 2014 (Via Future of Fantasy).
890	890	0	0	target: Lovemark 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Lovemark an obvious one at a decent price. Aron wise will always get my attention at 3 figs - stretch of 3 birds and 2 eagles in 7 holes '16
6042	6042	45	46	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We saw Kevin Streelman win here by shooting 64-64 on the weekend, including a finish of seven consecutive birdies. Relying on recent stats, the field leaders in SGP are Steve Wheatcroft, Justin Thomas, Jim Herman, Julian Etulain, Jason Day, Greg Chalmers, Kevin Streelman, Whee Kim, Brandt Snedeker, and Bubba Watson. Birdie or Better % (BoB%): There are not many weeks where we aren’t going to target birdie or better percentage because that’s what fantasy golf scoring is all about.
9710	9710	17	17	target: Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite winning here last year being priced right next to Spieth should result in lower ownership for Thomas. On paper, Thomas does not necessarily line up great for this course but has still found success. The bomber is able to adapt his game and change styles to fit Waialee.
3618	3618	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
5820	5820	6	6	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong. But the clincher with Rose this week is how he has played on courses similar to Erin Hills. Rose was 4th at Whistling Straits, 12th at Pinehurst No.2 but the most interesting one is his Scottish Open win.
6525	6525	11	12	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kokrak could be dangerous if he gets the flat stick rolling. Stewart Cink - $14,100    The 44-year-old veteran just continues to be under-priced, despite climbing to 53rd in the FedExCup standings with 13 top-30s in 20 events this season. Over his past 12 rounds, he’s 12th among the field in SG: T2G, 11th in SG: Approach and 14th in SG: Putting.
8323	8323	11	12	target: Robert Streb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's registered two top 15s and a scoring average of 68.04. Robert Streb … The 30-year-old was in danger of losing his card until a runner-up finish at The Greenbrier Classic in early July. He added a T22 at the PGA Championship where his greenside touch was on display.
483	483	16	17	target: Shawn Stefani, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
1196	1196	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3 - Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth. 2 - Jason Dufner, Fabian Gomez, Brandt Snedeker, Jimmy Walker. 1 - Aaron Baddeley, Daniel Berger, Branden Grace, Cody Gribble, James Hahn, Charley Hoffman, Si Woo Kim, Pat Perez, Brian Stuard, Jhonattan Vegas, Bubba Watson.
7519	7519	22	23	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With four reachable par fives and some short par fours, DJ can rack up the fantasy points for you in a hurry. Tony Finau – All Formats – DK: $9500 FD: $9200  He’s got to win eventually right? Finau has been gaining well over a stroke on the field tee to green according to our VIP PGA Spreadsheet, which shows field adjusted statistics.
2457	2457	14	15	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said the Salary Vs. Vegas Odds chart brings us the likes of Jimmy Walker who at roughly 60:1 odds is only $7,000 and on the surface seems underpriced. I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different. My only concern with Walker is whether or not he can stay out of trouble on what seems to be a course that requires some level of accuracy.
10351	10351	24	24	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given his comfort in the area, I wouldn't be worried about any fatigue issues. I am considering him the man to beat this week.While Rahm brings form and area knowledge, Matsuyama is the man to beat when it comes to course history at TPC Scottsdale. In four trips, he's rattled off finishes of T4, T2, WIN, WIN!
4730	4730	30	30	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament. Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him.
1045	1045	21	21	target: Kirk's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
320	320	2	2	target: @Thomas_Pieters 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Gone with @Thomas_Pieters at 80/1 in the @WGCMexico. Pieters was second at Riviera recently and this course may share some similarities
7567	7567	35	35	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We won’t have too much exposure in GPPs just due to our more balanced approach this week, but he’s as much a lock to finish well as any player in the field. Value Plays:  Patrick Cantlay $8,100 – Cantlay may still be relatively unknown to those that don’t keep up with the PGA Tour as much as those likely reading this article. However, he’s a stud.
6004	6004	1	2	target: Jamie Lovemark, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Jamie Lovemark, $7,700  A long-hitting, volatile player with upside, Lovemark has strung together some nice rounds lately. It included back-to-back 69s on Thursday-Friday at the U.S. Open, a 10th-place finish at Memorial and an 18th at Byron Nelson.
5706	5706	14	14	target: Jimmy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s another lock in cash or GPP contests on DraftKings. Best bargain basement option:  Jimmy Walker $6,500 – We’re going out on a limb a little bit with Jimmy here, but we like the value and likely the low ownership in DraftKings GPPs. Jimmy has already shown he can perform in majors with three tops 10’s and a victory at the PGA Championship just last year.
6588	6588	25	25	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
11906	11906	40	40	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His price was 8/1. So coming off a runner-up position at Copperhead on course debut last week, where he fell a single shot short of forcing a playoff with Paul Casey (now that would have been interesting), I think that Woods is in a great space to produce what pretty much all of us want to see: his 80th PGA Tour victory and the end of a long and arduous fight back from a catalogue of career-threatening injuries. 8th and 9th for ball-striking across his 2 Florida outings, Woods tightened up his driving last week in Tampa.
2124	2124	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally also look for a comfortable Poa Annua putter as putting from inside 10 feet here is always the toughest on Tour. Winners : 2017: Dustin Johnson (-17); 2016: Bubba Watson (-15); 2015: James Hahn (-6); 2014: Bubba Watson (-15); 2013: John Merrick (-11); 2012: Bill Haas (-7); 2011: Aaron Baddeley (-12); 2010: Steve Stricker (-16). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
8525	8525	15	16	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now, onto my sleeper picks of the week for The Northern Trust. DraftKings High-End Sleepers  Dustin Johnson ($10,800)  DJ hasn’t been in the best for this summer, but he played well enough in the last two majors to intrigue me. After injuring his back and missing the Masters, it’s been a tough road back to the top, but DJ is close.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
6463	6463	20	20	target: Lee 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since then, Scott Stallings, Ted Potter Jr, Jonas Blixt and Angel Cabrera have been winners. Last season, New Zealand’s Danny Lee won a four-man playoff over David Hearn, Kevin Kisner and Robert Streb. The win also earned Lee a place in the field for The Open Championship.
11788	11788	27	28	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When Spieth sets goals, he generally achieves them. As a past champ here (2015), this is as good of spot as any to pick up that W.  Henrik Stenson ($11,600): It's been love at first sight for the Swede and Copperhead. He posted a solo fourth in his 2015 debut and has since returned to collect two more finishes of T11 or better.
6582	6582	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has gained strokes on approach shots in six of his last seven events. There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it.
3393	3393	12	13	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harrington on the outsiders:  I think if you could get value on Adam Scott, I think he is my man. I know he’s not going to be an outsider or anything like that, but Adam Scott is putting well. [Scott is around 28/1]  It’s something he doesn’t always do, he’s putting really well and he’s working with AimPoint – he’s figured out that his putting problems actually come from his reading of the greens in the first place – he’s doing a good job on that and he’s holing putts.
196	196	43	43	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bethpage is a lengthy 7,468-yard par 71 and although we have scant evidence to go on - the 2002 and 2009 US Opens along with this event in 2012 - it's easy to spot plenty of big hitters amongst the respective top 10s. Reed biffs it just a few yards short of 300 off the tee and that puts him in the top 50 in Driving Distance. He's about much more than that though as shown by his ninth spot in Strokes Gained: Around-The-Green.
327	327	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
10794	10794	33	34	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Definitely two youngsters to consider strongly this week. PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO      Josh Culp  “@FutureOfFantasy”  Last Week Rank: 8,475  Season Rank: 5,252 *Did not play most of Segment 1*  Starters:  Dustin Johnson  Brandt Snedeker  Patrick Reed  Phil Mickelson  Bench:  Jason Day Pat Perez  Patrick Cantlay    *Swapping Pat Perez in for Jason Day, based on potential weather draw.

1400	1400	16	17	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WMPO Think Charley Hoffman could go well in this but my three value EW bets are Bud Cauley 100/1, Si Woo Kim 125/1… https://t.co/Y2refnxJXX
12384	12384	19	19	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight. All of this of course is wild speculation and if we have learnt one thing over the years of this event it is that to look too closely at someone’s draw and to plot their path is usually a fairly futile process.
5208	5208	4	4	target: Rickie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Value Picks and Sleepers  Rickie Fowler ($8,900)  Rickie Fowler is $8,900. For comparison, Patrick Reed is $9,200 and Brooks Koepka is $9,700 and are both ranked below Fowler in the OWGR. Rickie is a tough book to read.
2611	2611	47	48	target: Jason Dufner; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship (in alphabetical order):  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Rory McIlroy  Justin Rose  Henrik Stenson  Gary Woodland  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Jason Dufner; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Thomas Pieters; Jon Rahm; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Driving: Paul Casey; Jason Dufner; Dustin Johnson; Hideki Matsuyama; Francesco Molinari; Scott Piercy; Jon Rahm; Brendan Steele; Jhonattan Vegas; Lee Westwood  Approach: Paul Casey; Dustin Johnson; Kevin Na; Louis Oosthuizen; Jon Rahm; Jordan Spieth; Brendan Steele; Justin Thomas  Short: Bill Haas; Tyrrell Hatton; Dustin Johnson; Thomas Pieters; Adam Scott; Jordan Spieth  Power Ranking Wild Card  Francesco Molinari … For a special twist, I'll defer to PGATOUR.com writer Sean Martin, who pledged his allegiance to the Italian on Twitter. Even though I concur with selecting the trending ball-striker, Martin didn’t support the nod with data, but who am I to argue?
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
9017	9017	29	29	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is one of the best birdie makers in the field and giving the fact that he is guaranteed 72 holes, He is a must play in all formats. Woodland turned his 2017 season around at the end of the year and will look to keep the momentum going into the 2018 season. It’s been a few years since Woodland has found success in Malaysia, but he had a runner up finish in 2014 and 2013.
3774	3774	29	30	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All he needs is to keep up with the field with the flat stick and he'll be in contention. -- Adam Daly  FanDuel picks for Rounds 1 and 2  Patrick Cantlay  After making the cut in his first three trips back to the tour and coming up just short of a win at Copperhead, Cantlay is a great opening week play with solid scoring ability on the front end with some potential to get into the mix on Sunday. Remember, during his reign as the top amateur in the world, some of the other players looking up at him are now stars on the tour so as long as his back remains a non-issue, I fully expect Cantlay to continue to improve each week as he regains a feel for the week-to-week rhythm of the tour.
2233	2233	2	3	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Turcotte: Adam Hadwin ($6,600)  Sometimes, it's easiest to just not overthink things when it comes to how DraftKings prices golfers each week. I wrote about Hadwin last week and he produced value yet again. This week, his price is even lower for an event where he has posted consecutive top-25 finishes.
413	413	65	65	target: Kisner 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He talks about his 1st Masters experience and the impact of Draft Kings and Fantasy Free View in iTunes  139 Clean WGC Cadillac 2016 W/ PGATour Caddie Paul Tesori PGATour Caddie, Paul Tesori talks about life on Tour, caddying for Webb Simpson, caddie preparation, and the Tesori Family Foundation on this week's episode.

7803	7803	9	10	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most of my lineups will have Casey on them. Adam Scott ($8,800) – Seriously, why is Adam Scott priced in the 8k range whenever there is a strong field. Scott has 3 top 15’s in his last 4 tries here to go with a win back in 2011.
11433	11433	20	20	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a much deserved week off, Rahm is back and priced as the third highest golfer. WIth DJ, JT and Fleetwood creating all the buzz at the top, Rahm is getting overlooked. He only has seven tags on FanShareSports, despite his T3 finish here last year.
10891	10891	28	28	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats show that he's finished second and first in Scrambling for the last two weeks. He's also putting well (3rd SG Putting Phoenix, 19th SGP Pebble) although Mickelson being Mickelson he still can't hide his obsession with driving distance. "I've really had to increase speed to hang with a lot of the younger guys," he said at Pebble.
8492	8492	8	8	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm sitting here disappointed." Before his second place, Reed had banked a top five in the Travelers Championship in Connecticut (another course in the northeast of the U.S.) and even made an albatross when posting a top 20 in the European Open in Germany at the end of July. You get the feeling another win is around the corner and the return to New York - Reed's kind of town - could just get him over the line.
1651	1651	17	17	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA DFS T10 Model 1. Fleets 2. Hatton 3. JT 4. Noren 5. Rory 6. CH3 7. Sergio 8. Woodland 9. Hadley 10. Kaymer
807	807	3	3	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Anyone else feeling Grillo this week? I think this might be the big boys man party ive been predicting hes gonna crash very soon #ThePlayers
3849	3849	15	16	target: Kevin Kisner. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Six starts, never has finished better than T-46. • • •  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Kevin Kisner. Runner-up here in 2015 and his game is such a good fit for Harbour Town.
13570	13570	5	5	target: Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But wait a minute. Is Hoffman the prohibitive favorite in our format? In one sense, very much so.
11062	11062	41	42	target: Tom Hoge. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Daniel Berger has a similar profile to Harman but the same can be said of Kisner and Dufner – so many ball-strikers that come to the fore when bombing is taking out of the equation. However, the final vote goes to Tom Hoge. Catching the eye when leading the Sony through 16 holes of the final round, he hasn’t confirmed that form quite yet, whilst still not disgracing himself.
10559	10559	2	2	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
720	720	17	17	target: Kim. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Better than feeling bad... All the An and Kang this week with a sprinkle of Lee and Kim. #TeamKorea https://t.co/TCc8MHOJgR
5266	5266	15	15	target: Finau: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopefully, an off week at The Players will drive Dick Fowler, P.I.’s ownership down. Tony Finau: $7,900  Finau has played the Memorial twice and hasn’t finished worse than 11th. He arrives having finished 30th-or-better in five of his last seven starts.
12268	12268	38	39	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whether it be in the Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, EurAsia Cup or this event itself, match-play form is match-play form and needs to be taken into account. Market Leaders  Rory McIlroy (8/1)  Dustin Johnson (9/1)  Justin Thomas (12/1)  Jason Day (14/1)  Jon Rahm (14/1)  No prizes for working out the favourites this week, as they wrote themselves before the prices came out. Rory edges Johnson for favouritism thanks to his heroics at Bay Hill this past Sunday, whilst fellow former winner, Jason Day also features in the top-5.
1233	1233	15	15	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he gets the putter rolling he will certainly be one to watch here. Patrick Reed 11/1  Reed had a great finish to the season with a win and four top 15 finishes from the last seven tournaments. He finished T11 at the Travelers and followed that with another T11 in Rio and a respectable T22 at The Wyndham.
7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
12860	12860	1	1	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that. The Brit has a lethal combination of recent form and course form, and he brings an exceptionally good value.
687	687	14	14	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider - Harold Varner III  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Trey Mullinax  Vegas Odds - 200/1  Draftkings - $6,500  FantasyAces - $4,000    I love taking a rookie in this spot as he will most likely be extremely low owned. Oh ya and Mullinax has a tremendous amount of talent and through watching interviews, seems to have it together between the ears. PGA Tour pro Michael Thompson, who had the same college coach, went as far as to say Mullinax's raw power is best compared to Dustin Johnson.
7096	7096	38	39	target: Louis Oosthuizen, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some lists…. Top five finishers in last 6 Opens  2016 (Royal Troon): 1 Henrik Stenson, 2 Phil Mickelson, T3 J.B. Holmes, 4 Steve Stricker, T5 Sergio Garcia, Rory McIlroy, Tyrrell Hatton  2015 (St. Andrews): 1 Zach Johnson, T2 Louis Oosthuizen, Marc Leishman, T5 Jason Day, Jordan Spieth  2014 (Hoylake): 1 Rory McIlroy, T2 Sergio Garcia, Rickie Fowler, 4 Jim Furyk, T5 Adam Scott, Marc Leishman  2013 (Muirfield): 1 Phil Mickelson, 2 Henrik Stenson, T3 Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Adam Scott  2012 (Royal Lytham): 1 Ernie Els, 2 Adam Scott, T3 Tiger Woods, Brandt Snedeker, T5 Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald  2011 (Royal St. George’s): 1 Darren Clarke, T2 Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, 4 Thomas Bjorn, 5 Chad Campbell, Anthony Kim, Rickie Fowler  That’s 36 players if you’re counting. By region?
9478	9478	1	2	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Patrick Cantlay  Ladies and gents, meet the next generation’s Paul Casey. Albeit delayed a few years due to injury, Cantlay burst on the PGA scene in 2018 with all of the composure of a long-time veteran, making the cut in literally every event he played (13/13) with eight top-25 finishes and four top-tens.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
1665	1665	0	1	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kevin Kisner could threaten a third @PGATOUR title at 59/1 in the #HondaClassic. Kisner is much more comfortable pu… https://t.co/QRBXPcsafI
12798	12798	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting fairways and greens right now and with an average 312 yards per drive that's the green light for me to include him this week. Day rates 2nd in my classical golf course ratings (behind only Dustin Johnson) and 11th for Scoring Average, 6th for Birdie or Better Conversion and 3rd for par-4 Birdie or Better Conversion are also key stats I like this week. Has masses of correlating course form across the likes of Kapalua, Bay Hill, Houston, Quail Hollow, TPC Four Seasons, Congressional, Firestone, Bethpage Black, TPC Boston as well as East Lake and we also know that Day has the experience to handle changing conditions this week.
124	124	2	3	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Bubba Watson 1pt EW 45/1 with Bet £10 get £30 via this link:  So the blueprint for Bethpage Black is for longer hitters who are hitting plenty of greens and who like Poa Annua. Step forward Bubba Watson whose career results look very similar to 2012 victor Nick Watney. Yes, Watson has had his troubles in 2016 (he's only 24th in the FEC standings) and after a blistering February where he won at Riviera and was 2nd at Doral, he's been very quiet.
108	108	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
748	748	4	5	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Kevin Na ($9,500) – If you can believe it, this is actually an event Kevin Na won back in 2011 with a ridiculous score of -23, and it’s easy to see why. If length is taken out of the equation, Na has one of the best combinations of iron play and putting in the game. He’s a great value at this price.
1152	1152	7	7	target: Palmer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First 2 bets of week Knox 40-1 Palmer 125-1 #CareerBuilderChallenge
1100	1100	3	3	target: Gay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: B Gay 125/1, B Stuard 125/1, W Kim 250/1, C Campbell 250/1, M Hoffmann 250/1, C Conners 300/1
7493	7493	39	39	target: Kirk. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He does have a nice track record at this event, but his best finish -- a T-4 in 2013 -- came at another venue. As a wild-card pick, I don't mind it, but the ceiling seems pretty low for Kirk. Expert's Picks  Dustin Johnson  Patrick Cantlay  Ian Poulter  Adam Hadwin  Charley Hoffman  Mackenzie Hughes  Matt Kuchar  Grayson Murray  Tony Finau  Sung Kang  Expert's Explanation: Not that you necessarily need justification for the World No.
4734	4734	7	7	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			How about his stats? In this field, Finau ranks 3rd in SG-T2G, 9th in SG-App, 5th in driving distance, 4th in Par 4 scoring, 8th in Bob% and 9th in Bogey Avoidance. Shall I go on?
4733	4733	13	14	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lock him in and enjoy your 100 DK points DJ will put up. Tony Finau – $9,200  Tony Finau has it all this week. Course history?
4433	4433	22	22	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I would expect more of the same from him this week as he’s playing the best golf of his entire career. Matt Kuchar ($7,900) – Kuchar has been a little on the pricey side for his past couple events, but we now get him at a very reasonable price tag on a track that he has handled beautifully, including with a win in 2012. He makes few mistakes and like Fowler, has the right demeanor to not allow many of Sawgrass’ pitfalls to rattle him.
1234	1234	18	18	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He then had a win at The Barclays and followed that with a T5 at The Deutsche Bank. Reed also had a superb Ryder Cup for team USA winning a total of three and a half points out of five. He didn’t have the best start to the new season finishing outside the top 50 at The CIMB and WGC in China but he did bounce back with a T10 at The Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas.
396	396	14	14	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Post - Palmer - Valspar Championship - 3ew Moore 28-1, Stenson 11-1, 1ew Horschel 50-1
5675	5675	49	49	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Knox, the 39th best player in the world according to official figures, isn't exactly setting the world alight either but his 67 in Memphis on Sunday, which saw him climb from 68th to 37th, was encouraging enough and he has the best US Open record too. In two starts, Knox has finished 45th and 23rd. Laird has four missed cuts and a 21st to his name and Ramsay missed the cut ten years ago on his only previous attempt.
3631	3631	14	15	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s in nice form coming in without being too spectacular for extremely high ownership. Bill Haas 100% – We took him 100% a couple of years ago and he rewarded us with a 12th place finish. He’s never missed a cut at this event and he’s coming in playing terrific golf.
98	98	3	3	target: DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
193	193	63	64	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dave Tindall brings us his analysis and tips for this week's FedEx Cup opener - The Barclays at Bethpage State Park...  "As if revealing a window to his thoughts, he turned up at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday dressed like an American Ryder Cup player and his focus this week is likely to be intense." Each-way terms: ¼ odds, 5 places      Patrick Reed gave the 2014 US Ryder Cup team a much-needed injection of spirit and chutzpah at Gleneagles and there's simply no way the brash American will want to miss out on this year's renewal. He heads into this week's FedEx Cup opener - The Barclays - as a bubble boy.
10598	10598	53	54	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 2018 Waste Management Open field is loaded. Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed, Marc Leishman, Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Daniel Berger, Charley Hoffman, Phil Mickelson, Tony Finau, Zach Johnson, Si WOOOOO Kim, Xander Schauffele, Webb Simpson, and Kevin Chappell will all be trying to dethrone two-time defending champ Hideki Matsuyama. Even the mid-card is filled with talent, suddenly HOT FIYA Ryan Palmer will be in Phoenix, along with Brandt Snedeker, Shane Lowry, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Bryson DeChambeau, Grayson Murray, Jason Kokrak, Keegan Bradley, Kyle Stanley, Adam Hadwin, Brendan Steele, Cam Smith, Russell Knox, Peter Uihlien, JJ Spaun and Russell Henley.
9520	9520	31	31	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson will make mince-meat of the par 5s, and should easily turn in four rounds in the 60s. Spieth has the best record here, but Johnson has the most experience here. DJ has the longest winning streak on Tour (years with a win), and has not finished outside the Top 10 in this event since 2010 (T-16th).
9531	9531	8	8	target: Bryan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(No, we don't think DeChambeau will win.) Wesley Bryan - $6,200 (125-1)    At this bargain-basement price, Bryan is a steal. He's a well-known master wedge player and not-so-well-known pretty good putter.
10976	10976	22	23	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
8889	8889	25	26	target: Rob Oppenheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In his only previous start on the PGA TOUR, he tied for 11th place as an open qualifier at the Valspar Championship earlier this year. Rob Oppenheim ... It was just two years ago when he finished 26th on the Web.com Tour money list for the regular season.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
5969	5969	43	43	target: Day's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut at Erin Hills and doesn't have the look of a top-5 player at the moment, but he showed promise at the Memorial and turned in a runner-up at the Nelson. If you're going with a big gun this week, Day's the pick. Pinterest Andrew Redington  Expert Picks  Justin Thomas Brendan Steele Paul Casey Daniel Berger Patrick Reed Jason Day Brandt Snedeker Brian Harman Jordan Spieth Russell Knox  Expert Explanation : Half of this is riding the hot hand; after all, dude shot a 63 at the U.S. freaking Open.
6189	6189	11	11	target: Haas… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another top 30 should be in the cards this week. Bill Haas… If we think distance is muted this week, than Haas becomes a major factor on my board. With top 25s in each of his last three starts, he’s definitely worth a look.
12495	12495	40	41	target: Phil Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Another event that may be worth looking at closely, and another event that Fowler has traded at odds-on in before getting beat, is the Phoenix Open, staged at TPC Scottsdale. Holmes is a two-time winner there, the 2011 Houston winner, Phil Mickelson, has won there three times, and Hunter Mahan has also taken both titles in the last eight years. Huge outsider, Mark Wilson, the Phoenix Open winner in 2011, was in-the-mix at halfway here three years ago and so was Graham DeLaet, who traded at odds-on in Phoenix four years ago.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
11751	11751	34	35	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one thing he will be looking to improve the most is the putting and if he gets that going, and I think he will, he will be atop the leaderboard late Sunday afternoon. Jason Dufner  World Golf Ranking (#46)  Vegas Odds (60/1)  Draftkings ($7,800)  FanDuel ($10,100)  If you are looking for a cash game play on DraftKings, it will be hard to avoid Jason Dufner. He comes back with some excellent course history(for the price) as he has a Top 25 finish in five straight trips and a Top 30 finish in nine straight trips to Innisbrook Resort.
11432	11432	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tommy Fleetwood – $10,000  All aboard the Fleetwood train…once again. Make it three straight weeks of being in on Fleetwood and I apologize for being repetitive, but when a world class ball striker is affordable and a good course fit, he becomes a “jam him in” play. Fleetwood gained 6.1 strokes on approach shots at the Honda Classic last week, something we should start getting use to.
4052	4052	18	19	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he keeps up his good run of form this week he could be right in the mix. Luke List 50/1  The American has been playing well lately and comes to Texas with a decent bank of form. He had a good week at the Valspar finishing a respectable T27 on two under par for the week.
3062	3062	16	16	target: Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The slower/softer greens here should help and he’s simply too cheap for his talent level. Zac Blair ($6,400): Blair brings consistency this week and a lot of good play at corollary courses. He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico.
8534	8534	24	24	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Making 10/10 straight cuts Brooks is a great cash play given his price and has shown the upside to win against any field. Tony Finau – DraftKings all formats – DK: $7300 FD: $8300  The price discrepancy is too much to avoid Finau on DraftKings this week. Finau has mad nine straight cuts, finishing inside of the top 50 all nine starts making him extremely viable in cash games at this price.
11789	11789	22	23	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Showing signs of life recently, I'm going to try to jump aboard before the masses jump back on the Texan. DraftKings Picks:    Henrik Stenson ($10,200): Don't have to pay a premium for the Orlando resident that has finished T11 or better in all three visits to the Valspar. Matt Kuchar ($8,200): Should see his ownership plummet after a poor putting performance in Mexico.
8187	8187	19	19	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you get a nice saving with his price falling near the average mark on DraftKings. We’ll be playing Scott in GPP and Cash contests confidently. Daniel Berger $7,700 – Berger is a bomber and is playing some great golf right now.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
4033	4033	4	4	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons. I would not roster Kirk in cash games, but for GPP purposes his ownership will be extremely low.
742	742	11	12	target: Ben Martin: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smylie Kaufman: 10th Fry's Open/MC web.com TC/MC Nationwide Children's/43rd Small Bus. Ben Martin: MC Fry's Open/MC Deutsche/46th Barclays/MC PGA. Webb Simpson: 4th Tour/24th BMW/53rd Deutsche/15th Barclays.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
48	48	4	4	target: Grillo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I have to take Grillo again this week, at 50's. The kid just keeps improving!
1965	1965	13	13	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His game is solid and well suited for Pebble. My only concern with Rose is his putter, that is the main reason he isn't a cash play for me. The greens are pretty difficult on Spyglass and Pebble if you are on the wrong side of hole a 3 putt is on the table.
11172	11172	17	18	target: Scott Stallings, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His combination of strong driving accuracy and par-4 scoring making him a great value pick at $9400. Scott Stallings, $8700 – Stallings doesn’t necessarily pop as a player who fits the course perfectly, but his recent trend of three straight top-25s including a fourth last week at Riviera trump his lackluster course fit. In the last three weeks driving accuracy, greens in regulation, and putting has all drastically improved, and all these are key elements to scoring at PGA National.
10065	10065	22	23	target: Jon Rahm. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, the cut occurring after Rd 3 will mean birdies and eagles are even more valuable to take down a contest. Enter Jon Rahm. Don’t get cute.
937	937	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6. Alex Cejka - $7,300  Join GNN Plus and get the fantasy edge!
6311	6311	5	6	target: Adam Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to consider: Sung Kang, Adam Hadwin You can do a lot worse than Herman if you are trying to build a few stars and scrubs lineups. Herman will certainly be extremely low owned and offers a lot of salary relief (especially on FanDuel).
608	608	2	2	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
2214	2214	2	2	target: Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If not Scott, I’ll likely go with Furyk, who shook off some rust last week and has four straight top 25s in this event. Hideki Matsuyama, Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Why not Hideki?
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
2576	2576	13	14	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will be popular, but hard to pass on his form. Tier 2  Justin Rose $9,600 – His recent form is very good. Can bomb it when needed but precise enough to contend this week.
12266	12266	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson sealed his third win in consecutive starts when taking the title 12 months ago and already ranked World No.1 at the time, whilst Day was also coming off the back of a win at the Arnold Palmer and was ranked 2nd in the world before his win here in 2016 took him to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings. With the way the seedings work, it is no surprise that the higher ranked players have won here since the format change in 2015, with McIlroy, Day and Johnson all either 1st or 2nd seed the year they won. Johnson and McIlroy were both the No.1 Seed coming into the week and Day was No.2 so there have been no shocks in the last three years.

Rahm and Reed leave an average of $6,775 on Draftkings while Rahm and Phil leave a $7,050 average. If you are playing multiple lineups I would definitely have a Rahm line up along with a Reed and Phil one.
2172	2172	32	33	target: Patrick Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He made the top four at Riviera in 2011, added top 25s in 2012 and 2015 and had a final-round hole-in-one on the way to T10 last year. At a three-figure price, Patrick Rodgers certainly makes appeal. The former Stanford standout was fourth at Torrey Pines and T10 at the RSM Classic in his final start of 2016.
1403	1403	5	5	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@FantasyJesusDFS Did u factor in Noren hangover?
5460	5460	5	5	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts. Mickelson is 14th in strokes gained: approach and 20th in strokes gained: total.
1126	1126	62	62	target: Tiger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Results: $3- 150 Entries Entered: Best Finished- 5 th $33- 10 Entries Entered: Best Finishes- 22 nd $300- 3 Entries Entered: 23 rd    Players Used: $3- 28 players used $33- 15 Players used $300- 10 Players used    Player Own %- 33* Kuchar*-60% Horschel-55% Kisner*-45.3% Swafford-45% Campbell/Bryan*-40% Cink/Stanley-35.3% Chappell*-28% ZJ*-22% Howell/Furyk/Glover-20%    Hero World Golf Showcase: This event hosted by the one and only Tiger features 18 golfers with 2 of the top players in the world, DJ and Jordan. With 18 players, you have to nail an almost perfect lineup to get a W, or even a top 10 in this week’s GPP. In an 18-player event, and his first tournament in over 13 months, how high will Tiger’s ownership be?
2379	2379	7	8	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's what our optimal lineup looks like. Adam Scott ($12,200)  We thought that Scott would be less great without the long putter. Proving that length isn't everything, he leads the Tour in strokes gained, putting.
3973	3973	31	32	target: John Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hadwin rarely has a bad week and did shoot a second-round 69 here in his lone appearance in 2015 despite missing the cut. Finally, I'm going to throw a dart at John Peterson at 200/1. He's a born-and-bred Texan, who sits 14th in greens in regulation and 32nd for Strokes Gained: Off The Tee.
6095	6095	40	41	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's a look at our top DraftKings plays and value picks for the Travelers Championship. Key Stats: Birdie or Better % (BoB%), Par 4 Scoring, Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:App), Approaches 150-175 Yards, Strokes Gained: Tee to Green (SG:T2G)  Top-Tier Plays  Patrick Reed ($9,300)  The American Ryder Cup star, dubbed the "American Eagle" by many, is back on the right track after losing it for a little bit. From Week 7 to Week 16 (six events), Reed had three missed cuts and did not finish better than 38th.
8367	8367	11	12	target: Robert Streb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's registered two top 15s and a scoring average of 68.04. Robert Streb … The 30-year-old was in danger of losing his card until a runner-up finish at The Greenbrier Classic in early July. He added a T22 at the PGA Championship where his greenside touch was on display.
13201	13201	7	7	target: Cook, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This experience may well be invaluable to Cook, who will be looking for his second win of the season. At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut. Brian Gay 125/1 (Bet365) 0.5pt e/w:  Following straight on from the fact the information that Gay won here in 2009 by ten strokes, he has every chance of a repeat performance here, or at the very least threatening the top half a dozen players.
9281	9281	11	11	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is making his debut at this event this week. Henrik Stenson ($7,800): The No. 1 rated player in CSURAM88’s Model, Stenson finished second at the HSBC Champions in late October and was 35th in the European Tour’s Turkish Airlines Open earlier this month.
12070	12070	23	24	target: Bradley/Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
12109	12109	8	8	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That is the obvious risk you take whenever Scott finds his way onto your roster. However, if his ball striking is back to a place where we expect Scott to be, the putter will show up on occasion and you have to take your shots with him. Scott has three made cuts at Arnie’s tournament, including a 3rd place finish in 2014.
7753	7753	63	64	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			21st on debut here in 2013 was followed by 12th a year later and although he's not improved on that since, he arrives here this year in far better overall form and with a whole cabinet full of trophies acquired since then. RESULT: Winner  Kevin Chappell 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/5 odds):  Jason Dufner 1pt EW 66/1 with NEW! £100 matched bonus for new customers (6 places, 1/5 odds):  A field of the highest quality this week may well produce a fairly obvious winner - indeed 3 of the past 4 winners have been single-figure chances before obliging - and with 2 decent bets on a couple of the shorter-priced players that doesn't leave a massive amount of room for manoeuvre.
3453	3453	10	10	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be a great target in gpps this week. Bill Haas ($7,200): Haas is a player I’m very high on this week. He’s made seven straight cuts at Augusta and hasn’t finished worse than 24th here over the last four years.
10541	10541	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Duplicate teams are no fun and don't help anyone. FanDuel Picks:    Zach Johnson ($10,600): He's fully synced up with his latest equipment from PXG. Typically runs hot or cold, so I will keep riding the hot streak while it's here.
10724	10724	21	21	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed is 22nd in strokes gained approached, seventh in strokes gained around the green and 31st in strokes gained putting. J.B. Holmes - $7,400 (60-1)  These six-hour rounds must make Holmes feel right at home. He's finished top-25 here the last three years, and all that's gotten him is a $1,000 drop in price over last year.
175	175	27	28	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Using Palmer as a cut maker with upside gives us a lot of room to work with when building the rest of our roster. Taras Pitra -- Jim Furyk ($8,600)  If you missed it on Sunday, Justin Ray of the Golf Channel put out a tweet stating "In Jim Furyk's last 95 holes, he has hit 86 greens in regulation" which equals 90.5 percent. That's an absurd amount of greens hit, especially for Mr. 58.
13519	13519	4	4	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Avoid him in cash. Grayson Murray $7,300 – If you’re looking for a bomber who can score and look like an idiot on social media, Grayson is your guy! The form is ok, but the scoring potential and length will be an asset at TPC San Antonio.
137	137	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His win at the Olympics will be seen as a weakness this week by many and, yes, I can see a case of Rose either contending or potentially doing very little. There will not be much in between, but for me Rose played some brilliant golf in Rio to capture the Gold Medal where he topped Greens in Regulation, Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green and most importantly found his putter across the final 36 holes. He deservedly won Gold, but what makes me think he will continue to play well this week at Bethpage?
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
715	715	17	17	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Valero Texas Open - 2ew Chappell 33/1, 2ew Koepka 25/1; 1ew List 50/1
3881	3881	5	5	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The real reason to consider Horschel with odds of +3500 is the fact he has three top-five finishes in his last four appearances at the Valero Texas Open. Horschel clearly loves this course and he’s kind of due for a victory since his last one coming in the 2014 Tour Championship. Horschel is another solid play with a chance to make 35 times your money.
11764	11764	12	13	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DFS Army Pricing – Use code PGA for 10% off membership! Picks  Henrik Stenson – All Formats – DK: $10200 FD: $11600  At a course where accuracy is rewarded and the advantage of driving distance is mitigated I am all over Henrik Stenson. Stenson started the year strong in Europe with back-to-back top ten appearances and we have not seen of Stenson since.
8862	8862	64	64	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell has been playing some good golf lately and I look forward to seeing him play this week. He is a guy that has burned me more times than he has helped me out in Draftkings, but I have a feeling that a lot of other people will feel the same way and hopefully pivot to someone else in his price range like Kuchar, Garcia, Simpson, Reed, Hoffman, or Finau. I wouldn't call him a "core" player but he's the kind of guy you could see at the top of the leaderboard on Thursday and beat yourself up all weekend for not playing him.
1848	1848	18	18	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here. We know low scoring is Reed’s forte, with three of his five wins coming by way of double-digit scores. He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions.
12907	12907	1	2	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			31. Xander Schauffele (+8000). The Rodney Dangerfield of the PGA Tour.
9795	9795	18	18	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s horrible, even by his standards. However, even after conceding eight strokes to the field with his putter, Finau still managed to churn out a tied-for-16th finish — his fifth top 20 in his last six starts. Finau’s flat stick has been historically worse on Bermuda than any other grass type, but he has improved on this surface each year on tour.
5385	5385	14	14	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We love the value the $7,500 price tag brings in this weak field. Peter Uihlein $7,200 – Uihlein is a total stud! He’s a bomber that excels in SG: Off the Tee and scores birdies and eagles in bunches.
6043	6043	6	7	target: Brandt Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished third here last season. Brandt Snedeker ($9,400)  Snedeker is gut play for me this week because this course should suit his game perfectly. Sneds is a Pete Dye specialist, as we’ve seen him dominate layouts like Harbour Town.
2344	2344	9	9	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others: Seung-Yul Noh, Francesco Molinari  High-upside GPP Picks  Matthew Fitzpatrick ($8,000): Maybe the most talented player in the field this week, which is really saying something given the depth. Fitzpatrick won the Euro Tour ending playoff event last year and now has three wins to his name over the last two years and a top five at Augusta. This track really lines up well for a player like him who relies more on precision than power.
3628	3628	25	26	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Cold weather means shorter shots, which seem to help level the playing field. Also, we’ve done a lot of digging, especially looking at players like Bill Haas and Ryan Moore. Players who make a lot of cuts here.
13535	13535	28	28	target: Champ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is a long shot, but we are certainly willing to take a shot at this low price. Analysis: Taking a Stars and Scrubs approach with flyers on Champ and Niemann. Both youngsters that can mash it and bring loads of upside for their salary.
2189	2189	18	18	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows. Scott is on a roll recently and also boasts a strong record at this event. To recap: Two world-class talents in good form with fine course history.
55	55	8	8	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Wyndham Championship top 10 picks  1. Patrick Reed -- Reed is a former winner here, doing that in 2013 for his first PGA Tour win. He had a good finish in Rio (final-round wise), and he's been a top-15 mainstay most of the summer.
385	385	17	17	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here. Everything is trending in the right direction for Day.
6982	6982	24	25	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His success was built around impressive iron play and that will mean success this week – oh and he was 8th here last season. Scott Brown 1 point each way at 80/1 with Bet On Brazil – The American has had an odd year, with two runner-up finishes and another top 10 but has also missed the cut on eight occasions. Has finished 5th and 16th here in the past – like his chances this week.
10565	10565	2	2	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So, if Matsuyama is unavailable and you're trailing, give Holmes a rip in the desert. If for whatever reason, you're holstering Matsuyama, then you almost have to ride Rickie Fowler. Never mind that the WMPO sets up as his fifth-most logical event of those remaining.
5942	5942	36	37	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To make things even more appetizing, Thomas tied for third at last year’s Travelers and will look to break through for his fifth career win, and first on the U.S. mainland. Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts.
9983	9983	25	25	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let's jump in and take a look at this weeks tag counts. $10K Range  The top tier is small with just five golfers but Rahm, Harman, and Mickelson lead the way in the tag count with Rahm sitting with a commanding lead in start recommendations. I will have the most exposure to Mickelson in this tier but think there is a nice pivot opportunity with Patrick Reed.
8086	8086	15	15	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Kim, who even wears a Beatles badge on her golf cap, is a 29-year-old Korean. Matsuyama is a 25-year-old Japanese. So I’m not having it that he’s too young to have the most very basic grasp of pop culture.
2396	2396	11	11	target: Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus in truth, it will be an enormous shock were Martin Flores to challenge for the title, and it will be hard to get his odds to shorten up sufficiently to cash out. Though a winner on last year's Web.com Tour, Flores has rarely even contended at this level. Nevertheless, his credentials point to a respectable finish at least.
513	513	8	9	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll bet he makes it 3 for 3. Tony Finau is another big hitter whom I’d be considering for my lineup. Crooked Stick digs the long ball.
156	156	16	17	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After a solid performance in Sedgefield last week Sneds is certainly worth a second look here. Branden Grace 45/1  The South African always ups his game for the bigger events and looks in good shape coming to The Barclays this week. Since winning his first PGA Tour event at The RBC Heritage back in April, Grace has followed that with a T9 at The Texas Open, T5 at The US Open, T10 at The WGC Bridgestone and a T4 at the PGA Championship in Baltusrol which included a 66,67 over the weekend.
9705	9705	17	18	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As far as recent performance goes Woodland has made seven straight cuts dating back to last season. Jason Dufner – DraftKings Value – DK: $7300 FD: $10900  Despite being the 8th highest price on FanDuel, Dufner falls all the way to 39th highest salary on DraftKings. Dufner went under-owned last week as a result of shaky course history but played solid and finished tied for 11th.
6828	6828	25	26	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Either way his play before last week was very solid and I know he burned some people, which usually translates to low ownership. Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies.
665	665	0	0	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Billy Ho a name to watch this week at Valero: past 4 years: 4, 3, MC, 3. After MC this season: 2, 4, 13.
767	767	8	8	target: Pettersson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Have made initial bets on Webb, Haas, &amp; Pettersson due to course familiarity, but want to wait on rest w/forecast a… https://t.co/ROSZbJI7Te
9785	9785	1	1	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Aaron Wise  It’s time to jump on the former NCAA individual champion’s bandwagon before it’s overflowing with bodies. After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside. A ball-striking and long-iron extraordinaire, Wise is better on approaches the further he is from the hole.
4652	4652	35	36	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course features plenty of sand so we don’t want our core players to be hacking away from the sand. Past Winners  2016 Sergio Garcia  2015 Steven Bowditch  2014 Brendon Todd  2013 Bae Sang-moon  2012 Jason Dufner  2011 Keegan Bradley  2010 Jason Day  Weather  The weather looks as if we could see some rain in the forecast. This will be important to monitor as a couple years ago the rain turned the course into a Par 69.
11197	11197	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is ranked 44th in driving accuracy. Stewart Cink - $6,800 (150-1)  Cink is in the odd position of going 7-for-7 in cuts at PGA National but never securing a top-25 (he was T27 and T26 the past two years). So, if you are looking for a bargain-basement price with a really good chance to make the cut, Cink is your man.
5740	5740	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That being said, the USGA set up each year is often quite similar, so looking back at who has had success at this event over their career is at least worth reviewing. Jason Day has played in the U.S. Open six times and only finished outside of the top-10 once. He has runner-up finishes from both 2011 at Congressional and 2013 at Merion.
6292	6292	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
11972	11972	17	18	target: Hudson Swafford 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My model likes him a lot and his course history matches that. $6k – a few darts  Hudson Swafford ($6900) – Slightly under-priced and has good history, I like my chances with him. Bryson DeChambeau ($6900) – I think long-term he is a better player than this price and provides some decent upside down in this range.
9786	9786	8	8	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside. A ball-striking and long-iron extraordinaire, Wise is better on approaches the further he is from the hole. Get him next to the green, and he’ll struggle.
7930	7930	40	40	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the European Tour he’s won three times – as recently as the Open de France earlier this summer, and has flashed the form to compete on any track in the world. Although it’s in a very small sample size, Fleetwood has been elite in terms of hitting fairways at a whopping 75.71% – but on the Euro Tour he’s been just as consistent, at 73.7% (12th). He’ll need to take that great play off the tee into Charlotte, because as great as the 26-year old has been, he still struggles with a putter in his hand.
433	433	11	11	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Arnold Palmer Invitational - 2.5ew Fowler 18-1, Stenson 9-1
7226	7226	28	29	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Can’t justify ponying up for Day when guys like Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama are available in the same price range. • • •  Kevin Casey  Projected champion: Justin Rose. Yeah, it’s maybe too corny to happen.
3023	3023	5	5	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stay tuned! Core Players  Luke List ($9,900): List can absolutely crush the ball. The rough here isn’t as penal as we saw last weekend at the Arnold Palmer Invitational where the ball just stuck in the rough.
11138	11138	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four starts here, Scott has a win, two top-14 finishes and just one MC (on debut in 2011) so it fair to say he should be comfortable with the layout. Scott ranked 3rd for Greens in Regulation last week at Riviera, but of course did not hole the amount of putts he needs to, to go low or in fact break par. He shots rounds of 72-72-71-71 and ranked 75th out of 76 qualifying players in Strokes-Gained: Putting, which is no surprise given he ranks 203rd in that area on Tour this season.
1397	1397	4	6	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			🚨 Fantasy Alert 🚨 Charles Howell III has withdrawn from the @WMPhoenixOpen. Get your #FantasyGolf picks in at… https://t.co/Z78TkxzOC5
4032	4032	20	20	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His game sets up well again this week and should be a consideration for tournament contests. -- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons.
119	119	7	7	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just some sprinkles on Kizzire, Rodgers, Steele, Walker https://t.co/j6qIz4lHJy
1298	1298	30	31	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So look for players who are excellent Bermudagrass putters and who can convert birdie chances, rather than pure ball-strikers. Winners : 2017: Justin Thomas (-27); 2016: Fabian Gomez (-20); 2015: Jimmy Walker (-23); 2014: Jimmy Walker (-17); 2013: Russell Henley (-24); 2012: Johnson Wagner (-13); 2011: Mark Wilson (-16); 2010: Ryan Palmer (-15). Tournament Stats : We've published some key player statistics for this week's event that are well worth a look.
11469	11469	21	21	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rahm's upside is almost equal to Thomas', but the difference between, say, a $7,000 golfer and an $8,000 golfer is enormous. Rahm won the DP World Tour Championship to close 2017 on the Euro Tour, then opened 2018 by taking the CareerBuilder. The biggest detriment to Rahm's success is his temperament.
310	310	4	4	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dark horse: Billy Horschel  The only reason Davis Love III’s Ryder Cup dozen isn’t already signed and sealed is because of what Billy Horschel did two years ago. Tying for second at the Deutsche Bank in 2014, Horschel went on to win the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup – and we had the farce of the hottest player on the PGA Tour not at Gleneagles because of the selection deadlines. That won’t happen this time and Horschel travels to TPC Boston knowing he’s going to have to do something special once again if he is going to feature at Hazeltine.
6535	6535	38	39	target: David Lingmerth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also enters the week fresh off of two solid finishes in his last two starts, so it feels like just the right time to own Wagner -- especially for the bargain price of $5,300. -- Zach Turcotte  David Lingmerth  All things considered, Lingmerth might be the best overall fantasy golfer on FanDuel this week. He continues to show solid form with recent finishes of T5, T26, T21, T15 and T12, and also has a decent overall game for the Old White TPC.
4077	4077	12	12	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure List make your list among value plays this week. JJ Spaun $7,800 – Spaun is a Web.com graduate, making a huge impact on the PGA Tour in his first season. He gains strokes off the tee and makes a ton of birdies.
3862	3862	7	7	target: Stanley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a steal at $7,200 on DraftKings. Stanley consistently proves to be low-owned as he’s not the sexiest pick around, but he has potential to land a top 10 or even win this event. Love him in cash or GPP contests.
5989	5989	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed ($9,500): Reed may not have the razor sharp approach game that Casey has but he should be a good fit this week regardless as he can make up strokes at this venue with his improving short game and putter. Reed has a boom or bust history at this event with two top-twenties and two missed cuts over his last four appearances but I’m comfortable using him here as the real American hero has only finished outside of the top 25 once in his last six starts. Kyle Stanley ($8,400): I’m not sure if Stanley necessarily has what it takes to win at this venue, but like Casey his approach game can be so good at times that a shaky putter shouldn’t matter too much.
5220	5220	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years. Haas only has seven tags on FanShareSports.com, compared to an equally priced Byeong Hun An, who has 20.
1559	1559	7	7	target: Saunders 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Genesis Fleetwood 30 Noren 40 Bradley 66 Saunders 125 Rory parlay flames out. Top 5s on the first 3. Top 20 on Saunders.
12674	12674	35	36	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(Matt Kuchar is 24th on the money list at Augusta National, but he's always been a top-shelf bridge for a regular event due to this busy schedule among the elite.) Others worth considering in Houston:  Henrik Stenson has never had a top 10 at the Masters, so you might as well keep it simple and invest while he's in form and comfortable with the course. If you're like me, never mind the fade at Bay Hill and accept the top-five finish.
7872	7872	33	34	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Only reason I'm leaving him on the bench to begin with is because I have one start remaining. EXPERT BEN EVERILL , Staff Writer LINEUP | BENCH Jason Day  Brooks Koepka  Jon Rahm  Adam Scott  Dustin Johnson  Rory McIlroy  PROJECTED CHAMPION Adam Scott Former champion needs a kick for his season to be up to standard. Baby coming soon so he's looking to get points while he can.
10756	10756	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should also be lower owned than guys like Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, and Paul Casey in the same price range. Matt Kuchar $8,800  In the mid-range for cash games it's all about Kuchar yet again. The guy is just Mr.
819	819	40	41	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He rode a hot putter to a T8 in last weekends Sanderson Farms Championship and if he ride that momentum he could grab another Top 10 this week. Also Consider - Jamie Lovemark  Low End Target (Min Price - $6,900)  Jason Bohn  World Golf Ranking (165)  Vegas Odds (101/1)  Draftkings ($6,200)  FantasyAces ($4,500)    If you are looking for GPP value, Jason Bohn is it this week. He comes back to TPC Summerlin with outstanding course history, making all seven cuts and finishing T2, T18, T2, T8 his last four trips to Las Vegas.
3534	3534	48	48	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ got the monkey off his back thanks to a brilliant and bold display in last year's US Open and, with the weight lifted, I expect more to follow quickly. There were 10 years between Nick Faldo's Augusta debut and his first green jacket so we can forgive Johnson for taking his time to crack the code at Augusta National. This is his eighth appearance in the year's first major and the knocks at the door are getting louder.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
4259	4259	8	8	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Naturally this week his price dropped $1,000. Although Cink is not very flashy he is much more consistent week to week than anyone else in his price range and is very likely to make yet another cut and finish Top 30 again. ENJOY WHAT YOU’VE READ?
1999	1999	16	16	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's showing signs of a turn-back-the-clock season with top-25 finishes in his last three starts. Patrick Reed ($8,300)  In four career starts at Pebble, Reed has finishes of T6, T7 and T13 and no missed cuts. His ability to string together flurries of birdies always makes him an intriguing fantasy option.
3307	3307	39	40	target: Martin Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Australians have a nice record at this event and Adam Scott (a former winner) could go overlooked due to his lack of play. Lower down some speculative plays include Bud Cauley ($7,400), Kyle Stanley ($7,400), Roberto Castro ($6,400) and Martin Flores ($6,700-see write-up below). Recent Form  Top Recent Form (Overall):  1.
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!
4125	4125	68	68	target: Poston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
10425	10425	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Zach Johnson – $7,700  Zach Johnson has found a lot of consistency in Scottsdale. In his past three trips to the WMO, Johnson has a T10, T14 and T12. Another result like that would be perfect for a $7,700 golfer.
3222	3222	1	1	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein ($7,300) – It certainly wouldn’t make much sense for me to talk up Uihlein to the extent I have only to not recommend him as a strong play this week. Coming in at a nice $2,800 discount from last week (granted the player pool is apples/oranges), Uihlein represents one of the better bargain values on the board with all of the upside of some of the guys priced well above him.

2458	2458	5	6	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ve been very bullish on Jimmy Walker over the course of the last month and this week is no different. My only concern with Walker is whether or not he can stay out of trouble on what seems to be a course that requires some level of accuracy. The other standout on this chart is Johnattan Vegas who comes in near the minimum price and is coming into the event with incredible form.
5805	5805	26	26	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The South African also has posted consecutive top-five finishes at the U.S. Open, which leads me to believe he is ready to strike again. At $7,700, Grace is a great option for a mid-priced golfer when building your FanDuel lineups this week for the season's second major. -- Erik Dantoft
5056	5056	3	3	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			UPPER TIER  Matt Kuchar ($9,400) – Steady Kuchar looked like a potential cut risk on Thursday/Friday last week, but in typical Kuchar fashion, he rallied back for a nice and easy T12 finish. There is nobody in this field with a better overall track record at this course, and when it comes to smooth, steady T2G play, Kuchar is among the best ever. Lock him in.
2003	2003	29	29	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like DJ just fine but I’ll save and spend elsewhere for this LU. The next tier gives you some great options like JB (Don’t call me John) Holmes, Reed, Castro, and Blixt. After the MC in Phoenix I’ll take Castro to bounce back and hope some are scared off Roberto.
1732	1732	11	11	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Racing Football Outlook - Jeremy Chapman - Mexico 1.5ew Fleetwood 16-1, Rahm 12-1, Thomas 8-1, Johnson 13-2; 1ew Mi… https://t.co/5M5zYJSVkF
6362	6362	20	20	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has just been so damn consistent this season compared to the other options it’s pretty much a no brainer. Fowler is the clear favorite to win this week and is obviously the least likely to miss the cut. If you have to back only one golfer from +$10k, it’s 100% Fowler.
616	616	3	3	target: Peterson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@gfienberg17 I have Peterson circled...haven't pulled the trigger yet
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
938	938	1	1	target: @K_Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @K_Kisner at 20/1 in the @TheRSMClassic. Kisner deserves to be the favourite at a course where he won by six… https://t.co/4Bnersw26A
1066	1066	19	19	target: Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk 125/1 e/w. Dumped the PXG clubs and showed glimpses of form in the wrap around. Will back Every FRL just… https://t.co/nlXK2RBxtK
348	348	2	3	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: neutral			2. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now.
12707	12707	1	2	target: Bubba Watson's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Following Bubba Watson's third victory at Riviera in February, a total of 11 Masters Champions have now won 22 editions of the Genesis Open. Bubba, Phil Mickelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan and Tom Watson have all won multiple PGA Tour events at both Riviera and Augusta so the courses obviously correlate quite nicely. I'm not sure how much credence we can give it but recent history suggests a late start on day one is beneficial as the last seven winners have all teed off late on day one.
10008	10008	66	67	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We're relying on Mickelson having given an honest assessment but he's been good for that in the past and, at the price and in an event where most have some kind of question to answer, he's worth a decent each-way bet. Those who read every word of my 2018 Money List preview may have noticed that I put forward this event as a decent opportunity for Aaron Wise and Beau Hossler, and nothing has changed my mind on that since. Justin Thomas threatened to win it straight off the Web.com Tour and the three courses used are set up straightforwardly, much like most of the events on the feeder circuit.
10548	10548	19	19	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Despite all of the options in this deep field, what's notable is that the push is in play. Circle Matsuyama and move on. You're fine.
10810	10810	25	25	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I used this chart earlier with Reavie, but I love how it shows a golfer’s performance compared to how the field did for that round. Kuchar rarely disappoints us relative to the competition or any given round which makes him a superb building block anytime we can catch him for a fair price. Below $14,000  Rafa Cabrera Bello ($13,800)  Seems the flavor of this range is European’s lately.
8930	8930	3	4	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Russell Knox  11. Anirban Lahiri  12. Peter Uihlein  13.
1982	1982	12	13	target: Steve Stricker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Smith is T18 in proximity, 41st in SGP and 45th in GIR. Steve Stricker - $6,600 (125-1)    Stricker is nearing age 50, and he doesn't play so much anymore, but sign us for one of the game's best short-game performers at a bargain basement price. Stricker missed the cut last year in his first visit in sometime, but is coming off a T42 last week at Phoenix.
3029	3029	1	1	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%. Graham is an excellent ball striker, just struggles once he gets around the green.
897	897	12	12	target: Sabbatini 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Can’t believe the 250/1 on Ogilvy in Vegas is still standing. 200/1 Sabbatini very big also. Small dart at Hoge 200/1 too
8429	8429	7	8	target: Matt Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson: MC PGA/48th Bridgestone/6th Nordea/2nd Open. Matt Kuchar: 10th PGA/9th Bridgestone/21st Greenbrier/4th Canada  First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010. 2016 - Laird/Reed - Both AM -5/66.
5459	5459	1	1	target: Mickelson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Phil Mickelson: $10,200  The No. 20 golfer in the world, Mickelson has finished 30th-or-better in four of his last five starts. And from a course form standpoint, Mickelson has notched top-5 finishes in three of his last four starts.
11588	11588	33	34	target: Justin Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finishes top five in nearly half of his starts these days. Last 4 events: 16-2-9-1  Course form: 1  WGC form: 2-17-1-1-35-1-QF-14  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 44%, Top 10: 58%    Justin Thomas  "I'm very excited and very thrilled where my game's at. I feel like I'm playing very, very well.
364	364	6	6	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016. At 66th in the PGA Tour Driving Distance stats, Phil has taken an average of 6 yards off of his driving to hit more fairways in a bid to hit far more greens.
2920	2920	34	35	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The list goes on with legitimate cases quite feasible for Paul Casey, Tyrrell Hatton and Thomas Pieters but it's G-Mac at 50s that gets my vote. I will go for an American by taking Zach Johnson and making it a hat-trick of major winners on my team this week. The former Masters and Open champ is another with some impressive history here without actually winning.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
4605	4605	31	32	target: Graham DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Eventually, he’s going to string it all together all four rounds, and this seems like the perfect place. If you can’t stomach those guys and still want a contrarian option, go Graham DeLaet. The Pat Mayo Hour covers the entire scope of the Fantasy sports landscape from Football to Reality TV, daily and yearly leagues and everything in between.
12886	12886	22	22	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has a top 5 already, he made the cut last year shooting 2 under par rounds along the way without contending. Day also has the all important calendar year win which unfortunately Spieth doesn’t have. But above all the course just sets up perfectly for Day who has both power and touch in abundance.
152	152	39	39	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Maybe that’s because he’s in his comfort zone so he can miss a putt every now and again and it doesn’t define whether he wins or loses, so because he can, he probably misses less of them. Harrington on Jordan Spieth:  Jordan clearly has the X-factor. He plays golf pretty much like everybody else but he has that something special and he brings it to Augusta.
7023	7023	1	1	target: Murray: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grayson Murray: (7,200) Murray let many DFS players down last week at The Greenbrier after he withdrew from the tournament very early in his first round on Thursday due to an illness. Prior to this surprise withdrawal, Murray was a cut making machine, making it to the weekend in eight of his last nine events. There really isn’t any clear cut information about his illness, but it seems that it was very minor, as he is in the field this week for The John Deere Classic, which will be his first time competing in this event.
1254	1254	20	20	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And until we see otherwise, Day is still among the very best putters in the game. Tier 2 Values    Patrick Reed - $9,500 (12-1)    We're not ready to elevate Reed into the top echelon -- we'd have to see a major win before doing so -- but there's no denying he devours the Plantation Course. Reed was runner-up to Spieth last year and was the victor the year before that.
11596	11596	4	4	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pat Mayo welcomes Deshaun Watson, Joe Theismann, Jermichael Finley, Jamie Erdahl, Greg Jennings, Matt Mitrione, Kathryn Tappen, Jamey Eisenberg and many more into the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row. SHOW INDEX 1:29 Deshaun Watson 32 Free View in iTunes  106 Clean 2018 Fantasy Football - Tuesday on Radio Row Special with Stefon Diggs and many more! Pat Mayo welcomes Stefon Diggs, Chris Rose, Road Warrior Animal, Andy Benoit, Judy Battista, Caleb Truax, and Dave Hunt to the DK Live Pat Mayo Experience booth on Radio Row.
4461	4461	45	45	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also posted a 78 in 2016 and a 75 in 2015, and 2015 was the year he posted that career-best T42 around this track. Given the form he has been in since finishing T27 at Augusta, I think there is every reason to believe Grace is ready to finally put four rounds together around Sawgrass. After opening the Masters with a 76, Grace went 74, 71, 70 to climb the leaderboard and he has not looked back since.
129	129	19	19	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
2603	2603	26	27	target: Henrik Stenson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ's ownership will be insane, and I think you need to back off him expecting the Johnson-Johnson brain trust to fail to record a top-five finish. Henrik Stenson: $10,300  Stenson has turned in top-10 performances in his last three starts. An adept ball striker, Stenson picked up 1.243 strokes on the field last year with his approach play.
2161	2161	11	11	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But there's a lot of holes where you can make birdie." Johnson gives the impression he's only flexing his muscles at the moment and yet already the World No.3 has posted T6 in the SBS Tournament of Champions, T2 in Abu Dhabi and that solo third at Pebble Beach. "I feel like the game's in really good shape.
449	449	0	1	target: Harold Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harold Varner III 70/1 - T34 at Bay Hill, T11 thru 54 holes. 4th in the field in SG Approach. Beat a better field in Australia in December.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
12082	12082	25	26	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Aussie is killing it off the tee, sticking his irons, chipping well and, as usual, missing more 3-foot putts than everyone else combined. Classic Adam Scott. He’s lost almost three strokes per start over his last three events, yet he has churned out solid finishes since the Tour moved to the East Coast (T13/T16).
473	473	24	24	target: Flores 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Puerto Rico Open 🔥 takes: - Uihlein picks up the win - Varner with a top ten - Power with a top 20 - Flores with a top 25
3098	3098	29	29	target: Garrigus. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He was one of the biggest hitters on the Web.com Tour last year. He checks the box in Birdie or Better % and SG: Off the Tee, much like Garrigus. The Mulli-man has missed the cut in his last two events, but he could bounce back in this weak field.
843	843	11	11	target: ROSE 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			playing the best golf right now for my money: DJ KOEPKA ROSE KOEPKA's final round short game at Valero was spectacular.
117	117	3	3	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			We say fade Hatton and take Noren along with the salary cap savings instead. Hatton also showed some poor putting and lack of patience last week at The Honda Classic. These unknown greens in Mexico will result in tough 5 – 7 footers and patience will help.
12128	12128	34	34	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			When he catches some form, there’s a good chance he will keep it going for a while, so a good week here will certainly bode well ahead of the Masters in three weeks’ time. Fitzpatrick is first out on the 10th tee on Thursday, playing with Brandon Harkins and former winner of this event, Robert Gamez so he will get the best of the greens, making him an intriguing option as First Round Leader, an honour he shared with Emiliano Grillo last season. Tom Jacobs – Sam Horsfield to finish inside the top-20 (8/1)  Still just 21, it feels like Sam Horsfield’s name has been bounded around forever but that is because Ian Poulter has been gushing about the young Englishman’s ability for years.
6544	6544	0	1	target: Stewart Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stewart Cink $6,900 – This is just ridiculous! Cink’s Vegas odds to win should have him in the $8K range. He’s been incredibly consistent this year, having only missed three cuts in 16 tries.
2476	2476	8	9	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll be on at 16s. The each-way back: Justin Rose  Some might find 25/1 a bit short for an each-way shout, given some of the massive prices on offer at the WGC-Mexico Championship. But Rose really doesn’t look that far away from getting back on the winning trail.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
4727	4727	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,100  It has now been consecutive weeks that Jason Day has found himself in the Perfect Pivots section. Last week, it looked like it was going to work out before his final round 80 put near the bottom of the leaderboard.
1033	1033	21	21	target: Kirk's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
4758	4758	11	11	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Brooks Koepka: Koepka lost in a playoff to Garcia at this event last year. Importantly, Brooks has found his form: His 67.1 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks second overall this week, and his 18.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg is third.
4722	4722	1	1	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed – $9,400  Patrick Reed has now flashed solid form in back-to-back events, and I think it is time we can trust that he will pull through for us when we roster him. Saying Reed has struggled this season is an understatement, but we are all well aware of the caliber of golfer Reed is. He is back in his home state of Texas where he has had success in the past.
12099	12099	33	33	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day. Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.
2631	2631	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The dude hits his 3-wood straight as an arrow and as long as most pros hit their driver. Stenson should have no issue navigating these tight holes, raking up greens in regulation and filling the cup with plenty of birdies. Oh, his worst finish in his last six starts….T9.
5437	5437	1	1	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt. I would much rather pay up for a golfer with more upside and the same cut making ability as Cink, and find value elsewhere this week. Daniel Summerhays – $7,800  We all got to see Daniel Summerhays battle it out last week, and because of that, I think there will be more people who jump on Summerhays than there should be.
13195	13195	1	1	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
777	777	4	4	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I'm e/w on McGirt, Molinari &amp; Gay (long shot) in Wells Fargo this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
2484	2484	31	31	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ could make mincemeat of this course, Spieth could putt the lights out and Rory will be fresh and raring to go again after his break. It's a simple truth that Garcia has never won a major or WGC event but he does have 22 top 10s in the former and 12 in the latter. Seven of his WGC top 10s have come in this event although it's obviously been played at different venues and all are, in fact, top sevens.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
2936	2936	24	24	target: McIlroy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think these are the type of weeks when the cream rises to the top. For that reason, I am going to take Rory McIlroy. Two weeks ago, despite the rust, McIlroy still contended in Mexico.
4563	4563	26	26	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott won The PLAYERS all the way back in 2004 and hasn’t missed a cut in his last five tries. We are all well aware of Scott’s ball striking ability that can put him in contention week after week. It is just a matter of if his putter will show up or not.
6025	6025	85	86	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is not a lot of water at River Highlands, but there is on that hole, where almost 40 percent of the field notched birdies last year, but almost 15 percent left with bogey or worse.Weather-wise, typical Northeast conditions are expected for the first week of summer, though there is little chance of rain throughout the four days.Greens in regulation/strokes gained tee-to-greenProximity to the hole/ strokes gained approachScrambling/strokes gained around the greenDriving accuracy/strokes gained off the tee    Past Champions    2016 - Russell Knox  2015 - Bubba Watson  2014 - Kevin Streelman  2013 - Ken Duke  2012 - Marc Leishman  2011 - Freddie Jacobson  2010 - Bubba Watson  2009 - Kenny Perry  2008 - Stewart Cink  2007 - Hunter Mahan Greens tend to run a very slow sub-11 on the Stimpmeter, which enhances birdie opportunities but also neutralizes the best putters and brings a lot of other golfers into the Champion's Profile.The track features a drivable par-4 -- always fun for golf fans -- in the 296-yard 15th to add some drama late in the round. This week demands accuracy tee to green, and that will be focused on in the key stats below.
67	67	25	26	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This was only an eGolf-tour event and has no real impact on this week, but it is nice to know he has played well locally. Blayne Barber is my last value pick at $5,600. Making his last five cuts, Barber has found consistency at the right time.
4114	4114	37	38	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2452	2452	18	19	target: Hideki Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a tee-to-green behemoth with the ability to dominate this golf course as he has so many others. Hideki Matsuyama ($10,700) – So he shot an 80 at Riviera on a tough, windy day. That shouldn’t make him $1,800 cheaper than DJ.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
12850	12850	14	14	target: Matsuyama's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I hope it will be there at Augusta." There is also a flip-side to Matsuyama's low-key preparation. He goes into every major with the weight of a nation on his shoulders, with more media following him than probably every player here bar Tiger, and that has to have affected him from time to time.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
5943	5943	6	6	target: Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Longer Shots Worth a Risk    Bubba Watson, $8500 – It’s hard to comprehend the poor play Watson has exhibited this season, but if he is going to turn it around, there is no better place than TPC River Highlands. Watson has been victorious here twice and has notched three more top-6 finishes in 10 career starts. Marc Leishman, $8300 – Leishman broke through for his first PGA Tour win here in 2012, and has since blossomed into a multiple-tournament winner on Tour with a few close calls in major championships.
12013	12013	13	13	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Argentine enters this year playing his best golf in a while. Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill.
12378	12378	79	80	target: PATRICK REED 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Those of you who have studied the draw will have noted that Rory and JT are seeded to meet in the Semi-Finals meaning we can’t get a dream final containing both of these picks, however in effect by staking 7 points on them combined, for a 32 or 36 point we are basically getting in between 4-1 and 5-1 on a win for either, and I am happy to take this on the two form horses in the field. PATRICK REED – 30-1 - 1pt E/W - 1/4 odds 1st 4 Eliminated Last 16  My final pick for the week goes to ‘Captain America’ Patrick Reed. Reed had a fairly slow start to the 2017-18 PGA Tour season however he has come good over the last couple of weeks with 2nd and 7th place finishes at the Valspar and API respectively.
981	981	16	17	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No action on the #SentryTOC this week, but here are my favorites: 1) Jon Rahm 2) Dustin Johnson 3) Jordan Spieth… https://t.co/BsgkBsSTFV
11511	11511	23	23	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DraftKings scoring will also be extremely important to win cash this week as the WGC Mexico is a no-cut event. On that note, Casey ranks 6th in the field in DK scoring putting him just below favorites like DJ, Rahm, and JT but at a much cheaper value. Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field?
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
546	546	38	38	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 63 in SG: OTT and 68th in SG: APP but ranks 10th in Par 5 Scoring and 4th in Scrambling. Due to the separation in stats from other golfers in the range I will be using Reed in GPP's only this week. Also Consider - Jason Day  Mid Tier Targets ($7,000 - $8,900)  Bubba Watson  Vegas Odds - 40/1  Draftkings - $8,600  FantasyAces - $5,550    Value play of the week!!
2028	2028	10	11	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*Also, apologies for going all Lee Corso on this analysis. Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised.
2775	2775	17	18	target: Lee McCoy. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Close here last year, but he often goes under-owned when he shouldn’t. Sleeper of the week = Lee McCoy. Played great as an amateur here… but the real reason I like him is he has played the course over 1000 times growing up so close.
968	968	3	3	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			#HeroWorldChallenge Picks Reed Berger Tiger😀 I also have a Fowler exotic (parlayed him w the Rams from Sunday)
9784	9784	6	6	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s not asking too much. Aaron Wise  It’s time to jump on the former NCAA individual champion’s bandwagon before it’s overflowing with bodies. After earning his Tour Card in the fall, Wise put together an inconsistent swing season (T13/MC/T32/T25/MC) but showed flashes of his gaudy upside.
481	481	14	15	target: Kelly Kraft, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some Shell Houston Open deep punts that I could be interested in: Bud Cauley, Kelly Kraft, Shawn Stefani, Whee Kim, Kyle Reifers.
99	99	21	21	target: Hagy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Safeway Open: B DeChambeau 90/1, JJ Spaun 160/1, A Wise 200/1, X Schaufelle 250/1, J Randolph 300/1, N Lindheim 300/1, B Hagy 400/1
6252	6252	64	65	target: Scott Stallings 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m not prioritizing it when selecting golfers this week. Here’s how the top 20 percent of golfers in Rec metrics perform:  Adj Rd Score: -1.37  GIR: -2.39  DD: -2.09  DA: -2.82  SC: -2.60  Adj Bird Avg: -6.45  A Few Names to Remember (From Comparable Courses)  Among golfers with at least five starts in our database at these two comparable courses, both Chad Campbell and Scott Stallings have been consistent, exceeding salary-based expectations in five of their six outings (83.3 percent). Campbell is not in the field this week, but Stallings is, priced at $6,900 on DraftKings and $5,300 on FanDuel.
11472	11472	6	6	target: Miyazato 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Also like Kodaira, the No. 54-ranked Miyazato was in the Sony but MCed. He recently tied for 11th in a tournament in Australia co-sponsored by the European Tour and won by Kiradech Aphibarnrat.
12708	12708	64	65	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having won the USPGA Championship in August, Justin Thomas has now won four of his last 14 starts and if he claims his second major in-a-row on Sunday he'll move to the top of the Official World Rankings. He would have done so if he'd have reached the final of the WGC-Match Play final two weeks ago but he admitted after his loss to Bubba Watson in the semi-final that moving to the top of the rankings was constantly on his mind. That's one concern, and so is his poor Augusta record.
1819	1819	6	6	target: Castro: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fire him up at $7,000. Roberto Castro: $6,900  With top-20 finishes his last two times at TPC Scottsdale and respectable recent form, Castro is well worth taking a flyer on at $6,900. Castro was 32nd on tour in strokes gained: approach-the-green last year.
3087	3087	42	42	target: Brown's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished with a T18 at another less-than-driver event -- the Valspar Championship -- in which he shot -8 on the par 5's, which is something he'll need to duplicate this week if he's going to collect a big paycheck come Sunday. Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event.
3595	3595	24	24	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I have noticed that guys can go either one of two ways when they take some time off, either really bad or really good. Day seems like the type that time off is helpful to his game and thinking through the shots and how he wants to play the course. Over the last two years, Day has finished in the top ten in two of his tournaments and top 30 in all four years.
9218	9218	11	12	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's going to be chalky at this price. -- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor.
11252	11252	24	24	target: Glover 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Glover has an even better score of 69.3, and he’s only $7,200. Cink has missed two cuts in a row and is 44, and Glover has poor history at PGA National, but they’re definitely underpriced relative to their talent. Two other guys who stand out in the $7,000 range are Charles Howell and Russell Henley.
6304	6304	17	17	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better place than D.C. for Captain America to get his first win of the season? Bill Haas (DK: $9,500, FD: $8,400)    A difficult course with a weak field is a prime spot for Haas to pop. Haas is a Pete Dye specialist, and I’ve heard some golfers say that TPC Potomac has a lot of qualities that you would find at a Pete Dye course.
3062	3062	15	16	target: Zac Blair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The slower/softer greens here should help and he’s simply too cheap for his talent level. Zac Blair ($6,400): Blair brings consistency this week and a lot of good play at corollary courses. He’s finished inside the top ten at Hawaii twice and also has a top twenty to his name in Mexico.
226	226	43	44	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With his strong form, history of playing well in the FedEx Cup, and his putter that can carry him through an event, Snedeker is an excellent play in tournaments this week, and you should be able to get him at a low ownership. Kevin Na ($7300)  He’ll be chalk. There’s no question about it.
5293	5293	9	9	target: Poulter’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With a severe lack of distance off the tee, Poulter’s overall OTT numbers don’t seem appealing (142nd in SG: OTT, 168th in Distance), but Poulter is very accurate (64.03% of fairways hit). If Poulter struggles on approach, he’s currently 11th in Scrambling and 3rd in SG: Around the Green overall – with a cut line below E, Bogey Avoidance will be more important than normal, and Scrambling (as shown above) plays a huge part in avoiding squares. In that same vein, he’s also 2nd in 3-Putt Avoidance although his overall putting numbers aren’t anything to write home about.
874	874	3	3	target: List, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm e/w on List, Lovemark &amp; Kaufman in Las Vegas this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips #golf
1761	1761	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surely the tare has to end somewhere, soon?!? $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Ryan Moore ($8.6m) and Matt Kuchar ($7.4m); Brendan Steele is unlikely to disappoint at $8.2 million. 5th (2012), 5th (2013) and 6th (2014) tell you all you need to know about his liking for this test, but his recalcitrant putter is likely to keep him away from the ultimate victory.

4999	4999	21	22	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Mick, Perez has incredible value and another DK gift you have to take advantage of. Best bargain basement option  Bill Haas $6,900 – Right now you’re asking yourself, what in the heck is Bill Haas doing in the “bargain basement option” category. Yes.
8608	8608	9	10	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recommended bets:  Back Harold Varner III @ 90/1  Back Patrick Cantlay @ 40/1  Back Kevin Chappell @ 40/1  Back Charley Hoffman @ 40/1    Follow me on twitter @dangeraghty10 Both Chappell and the undisputed first round King (Hoffman) have an abundance of recent and course form - get them onside to make fast starts. Chappell is in (more or less) a two man race (with Charley Hoffman) for the final automatic Presidents Cup place, and whoever has a better finish at this week's Dell Technologies Championship will very likely take the spot.
6610	6610	9	10	target: Robert Garrigus 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bryson DeChambeau  Top Strokes Gained: Putting (last week)  1. Robert Garrigus  2. Andrew Loupe  3.
9947	9947	35	35	target: Stuard. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That ranking of 38th in Greens in Regulation is better than it looks as well. Of the players that have played 24 rounds (how many he’s played) or more, only three players rank higher than Stuard. He is currently hitting over 74% of greens which is more than acceptable and will aid him this week.
2913	2913	8	8	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			He’s 4/4 with 3 inside the top 20. Molinari is one of the most consistent and reliable golfers out there. He did have a MC a couple weeks back but overall is 4/5 with all 4 inside the top 20.
438	438	21	21	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's also a former champion here, so I certainly won't talk you off of him in tournaments. Top Pin Seekers  Jason Day - DK Salary $12,500 - Easy to hit fairways will mitigate his issues lately off the tee, as every other facet of his game, especially the putter, is firing on all cylinders. He has the highest projection on the Colossus Optimizer, and with the soft pricing this week, I will have some heavy exposure to Day in every format.
8227	8227	7	7	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips. McIlroy appears to have turned his disappointing season around with two top-five finishes in his last two starts.

9021	9021	46	46	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The putter is his weakness, as we saw in Canada, but that's less of a concern on greens few players in this field have seen before, and it's worth noting that some of his better efforts have come on the grainier surfaces of Hawaii and Mexico. Woodland tied with Pat Perez and Hideki Matsuyama in co-leading the greens-in-regulation charts last week and seems bound to set up chances. With the par-fives here looking more scoreable it could well be that he can improve on a share of 28th without necessarily making many more putts.
12103	12103	33	33	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His elite long iron game as of late will be very important if he wants another top 5 finish like he had here in 2016, where he was the runner-up to Jason Day. Chappell has yet to miss a cut this season, something that cannot be said for the majority of golfers priced in this range. If his putter shows up for just this week, we just need ONE week, the reward for rostering Chappell will be very large.
10711	10711	40	41	target: Nick Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Currently 18th in total driving, fourth in greens hit and fifth in scrambling. In seven appearances at the AT&T since 2010, he's missed only one cut while hanging up three top 20s, including in each of the last two years. Nick Taylor … He may not be soaring on the same trajectory as Waste Management Phoenix Open runner-up Chez Reavie, but the 29-year-old from Canada is in the same lane.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
13198	13198	9	9	target: Cook’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All these performances suggest this style of track suits Cook’s game. Whilst his current run of form (MC-T49-T40-T36-MC) suggests Cook is struggling of late, I remain optimistic regarding his chances this week, as this test looks right up his alley. Another positive factor to bear in mind, Cook has veteran caddie, Kip Henley on the bag.
2002	2002	21	22	target: Ryan Brehm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vaughn Taylor has made nine consecutive cuts and is looking to channel his good vibes from last year’s victory. DraftKings bargain: Ryan Brehm at $6,700. Has made seven of eight cuts in his first season on the PGA Tour, hits it a mile and seems poised to finish top 5 at some point sooner rather than later.
851	851	7	8	target: Brooks Koepka. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Has a power game that travels well. Brooks Koepka. Has a power game that travels well.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
11851	11851	15	15	target: Smith 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ride the wave of hot irons, and hope the short game falls into place. Cameron Smith  After an amazing run in Australia late last year, Smith came into 2018 with a ton of hype. People even were putting him in the conversation to win at both events in Hawaii.
7463	7463	39	39	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It may not seem like much, but after missing what seemed like every cut earlier in the season this should give Bubba a big mental boost and sets him up well on a course he has taken to well. Watson has gone T21 and solo second over his two starts at Glen Abbey and crushed the par 5’s here in 2015 (he was an incredible -16 on them for the week). He lines up as a great risk/reward tournament play on DK.
5425	5425	28	29	target: J.B. Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His betting odds suggest he should be priced around the mid $8K range, but we should all be glad to take the $1,000 discount and go shopping elsewhere. J.B. Holmes – $6,800  J.B. Holmes price this week is the biggest mistake on the board. For quick reference, he is priced $500 MORE next week for the U.S. Open, which has a slightly better field….How is Holmes priced this low??
8385	8385	19	19	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day shot an 8 on the par-4 18th in round three and that derailed his chances of winning massively. Day fired opening and closing round 70’s either side of a very impressive 66 second-round which propelled him right into contention, behind Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama. Whilst Day couldn’t get the job done on his last start, I think he has shown enough to contend again, at a course he should enjoy.
1909	1909	40	41	target: Dustin Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . For the record, here's the breakdown of pure Poa Annua and Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  5 - Dustin Johnson. 4 - Brandt Snedeker.

3809	3809	128	129	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he keeps the putter hot then there is no reason he shouldn't be near the top of the leaderboard come Sunday. =SUPER SUBS=  Martin Kaymer, Pat Perez      Ryan O’Sullivan (O)  “The Golf Aficionado”      Last Week Points: 162  Segment Points: 287  Segment Rank: 13,991    Season Points: 2,123  Season Rank: 649  Group A  Luke Donald (10) and Branden Grace (10)    Group B  Charley Hoffman (8), Matt Kuchar (10), Jim Furyk (9) and Russell Knox (9)    Group C  Russell Henley (10) and Bryson DeChambeau (10)      Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 148  Segment Points: 273  Segment Rank: 18,942  Season Points: 2,151 Season Rank: 295  Group A  Bill Haas (9) and Branden Grace (10)    Group B  Lucas Glover (10), Kevin Na (10), William McGirt (9) and Jim Furyk (10)    Group C  Patrick Cantlay (10) and Kyle Stanley (10)      ~  Daily Fantasy Sports [DFS]  I will be giving out selections for one team each week.

6588	6588	24	24	target: Luke 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He proved with his Players win, he does not need to show any signs of solid form before coming out of nowhere to win. Luke List – $6,400  Alright Luke, let’s try this again. List was a trendy pick last week, and in hindsight, it definitely was not the move.
129	129	18	19	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
1041	1041	27	28	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last six years for The RSM Classic, here are the standouts:  Kevin Kisner (T26-MC-T20-T4-WIN)  Webb Simpson (T12-2-T7-T41)  Kevin Chappell (T43-T32-T8-2)  Brendon de Jonge (T15-T60-T4-T16-T2-T33)  Chris Kirk (T15-MC-T64-WIN-T4-T18)  Matt Kuchar (T25-T20-T7-T22-T25)  Jim Furyk (T11-3)  Robert Streb (WIN-T25)  Charles Howell III (T6-T32-T7-T27-T73-T9)  Ken Duke (T15-T20-T4)  After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Matt Kuchar, Brandt Snedeker, Bill Haas, Lucas Glover, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Kevin Chappell, Charles Howell III, Billy Horschel, Harris English. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Kevin Chappell, Chris Kirk, Charles Howell III, and Matt Kuchar.
514	514	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I will be spending 55 minutes of our 1 hr podcast telling @KendoVT how much I love Finau this week https://t.co/726ehHw8QO
7369	7369	5	6	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ will be just fine. Rory McIlroy – $11,000  What to do with Rory this week could actually be the million dollar question. He has been very bad lately, missing three of his last four cuts.
7655	7655	60	61	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The American has six top-10 finishes in his last thirteen major starts including a win and four top-6’s and whilst he has yet to make a real impact at the WGC events, beyond his 6th here in 2015, it is worth chancing that he is going to ride this clearly massive wave of confidence right now in another strong-field event. Branden Grace 50/1 (UniBet) 1pt e/w:  Branden Grace played well two weeks ago at Royal Birkdale, largely thanks to his third round 62, a first of its kind in major championships. Grace shot two rounds of level par and a four-over 74 either side of the 62, and the pair of 70’s were impressive enough in their own right.
774	774	7	7	target: McGirt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@WellsFargoGolf PGA Picks Scott +1800 Berger +3300 McGirt +4000 Holmes +4000 Varner +10000 --- Reed +4000 Poston +11000 🇸🇪Porn👑 +25000
310	310	1	1	target: McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, McIlroy value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt way better than ave (line) on handy GP… https://t.co/9OP07g5IZt
1468	1468	14	15	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If I didn't blow all my money on Berger/Finau last week, I'd place a Chris Kirk to win bet.
3660	3660	22	22	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He looks set for a bright future, but already he is making moves, with three European Tour wins already to his name. Fitzpatrick really announced himself on the world stage at the Masters last year, where he finished T7, just two years removed from his debut at the course as an amateur. One week after that debut at Augusta he was invited here, and he finished T23 when still an amateur.
7001	7001	37	38	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Leave the bombers at the door; your lineup needs to be filled with the best iron players available. Getty Images  Professor's Picks  Kevin Na  Wesley Bryan  Bubba Watson  Zach Johnson  Ryan Palmer  Robert Streb  Charles Howell III  Luke List  Ryan Moore  Kevin Kisner  Professor's Explanation: For any fan of the PGA Tour, even if you know nothing about golf statistics, when you hear John Deere Classic, you think Zach Johnson, Steve Stricker, and Jordan Spieth. Well, Jordan is off to the British Isles to get ready for the Open Championship, but Zack and Steve are returning for the fun.
4405	4405	3	3	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most certainly. However, Walker has started to regain form his past few starts. He churned out a pair of T20s at The Masters and Valero by getting his game figured out on the tee box.
7570	7570	17	18	target: Ben Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
416	416	42	43	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Picks for this week:  USA 1: Rickie Fowler – Rickie is now relying on a pick for the Ryder Cup, which he is probably in good standing for, however a victory this week would guarantee his ticket to Hazeltine. USA 2: Patrick Reed – I’ve always felt the Texan has a game to match anyone in the world and, after his win last week, maybe this could be his time. Winning back-to-back doesn’t happen very often, but it seems to happen more in the Playoffs than at any other time of the year, there has been five back-to-back winners in FedEx Cup history – the last was Billy Horschel in 2014 who won the BMW then Tour Championship.
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
507	507	22	22	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			plan for SHO is hit up few 40/50-1 guys and bunch of 200+ Flores (7th in GIR) 200-1 Ogilvy 250-1 Peterson 250-1 Cauley 200-1 Castro 275-1
11063	11063	35	36	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given Palmer has form at the Pheonix, the missed-cut doesn’t look great but rounds of 71/72 are never poor and I still believe there is plenty to work from. The one thing we know about Brian Harman is he will find greens. Seemingly never out of the top-10 in that particular stat, his missed-cut at the Farmers stopped an impressive run of five top-10s and a top-20, his claims boosted further with that 4th at the Sony (opened 65/68).
2350	2350	13	14	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take the South African with odds of +4000 given his current form. Adam Scott - Adam Scott is the overall favorite to win the Honda Classic, but you can still fetch him with odds of +1100. Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open.
5077	5077	43	43	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His best finish here was a T5 in 2010, and although he has two first round W/Ds to his history, he hasn’t missed the cut here going back to 2008. There’s not a lot to dislike about Mickelson for cheap, and paired with Fleetwood he leaves a lot of room up top. Rickie Fowler ($8900): At this bargain basement price, expect Fowler to be fairly chalky this week, but for good reason.
13200	13200	25	25	target: Cook, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Henley was previously Brian Gay’s caddie, and was so when Gay won here by ten strokes in 2009. This experience may well be invaluable to Cook, who will be looking for his second win of the season. At 100/1, Cook looks overpriced to rediscover his early season form, on a course that should suit despite this being his debut.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
7177	7177	7	7	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, with that being said I think Stenson will see suppressed ownership as a result of being priced next to Tommy Fleetwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama. All three of these players are coming in with great form and are being talked up (especially Ricky) so a pivot to Stenson in some GPP lineups makes a lot of sense. Finally, In 2008 Stenson finished T3 at Royal Birkdale showing he has the game for this event.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
13093	13093	1	1	target: Scott’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			But Scott’s ability to get to the green is slowly returning to an elite level, and that’s what we should all care about this week. Over his past 12 rounds, Scott ranks seventh tee to green, 16th in Strokes Gained: Ball Striking, and sneakily sits fifth around the green in that span. Still, there’s something about Augusta that triggers the best in Scott.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
2518	2518	47	48	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: David Lipsky (coming off 2nd place finish, has won at altitude before)  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Gary Woodland, Paul Casey, Martin Kaymer, Louis Oosthuizen  – Thomas Pieters, Pablo Larrazabal, Alex Noren, Danny Willett, David Lipsky, Ben An, Jason Dufner  Good luck with your DraftKings WGC Mexico Championship lineups and picks, and make sure you’re checking back on our Golf Picks section to get Keagan and Alex’s picks that will be posted by Tuesday evening. He’s played great at the Omega Masters over the years (won there in 2015 and runner-up in 2012) so can definitely handle the altitude shift. Don’t forget that he finished T5 in his second last start and won’t have to deal with questions about fan behavior here; and that should help him get out of his own head this week.
1875	1875	51	51	target: Mickelson’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mickelson was 28/1 last week to win an event he has won three times, this week he is 22/1 to win an event he is looking to win for a fifth time. That fifth win could easily have come last year, however a final round 65 from Vaughan Taylor compared to Mickelson’s 72 was costly. Mickelson lost out by just one shot and he will be looking for redemption this week.
1066	1066	6	6	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Kirk has won four times while Chappell has yet to cross the line. However, Chappell has more podium finishes (9) to Kirk's eight. The four wins play a big part into why Kirk's career earnings per event is $86,402 while Chappell's is down at $65,278.
1834	1834	15	15	target: Rahm: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He still carded yet another top-ten finish, so disregard him at your own peril. Jon Rahm: It wasn’t quite the fireworks performance we’re used to seeing out of him, but to follow up your win at Torrey with a T16 at a reasonably-demanding Phoenix course playing your “B” game is pretty nuts. Rahm is not going away, and he should be on your speed dial in virtually every event going forward regardless of layout.
13519	13519	4	5	target: Grayson Murray 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Avoid him in cash. Grayson Murray $7,300 – If you’re looking for a bomber who can score and look like an idiot on social media, Grayson is your guy! The form is ok, but the scoring potential and length will be an asset at TPC San Antonio.
12127	12127	23	23	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here are the bets we at the Golf Family like this week in the side markets at Bay Hill. Jason Daniels – Matthew Fitzpatrick to be the First Round Leader (80/1) and to finish inside the Top-20 (7/2)  Whilst Fitzpatrick’s form of late is a worry, his Tee-to-Green game is still in decent shape and he will be looking to build on that as he looks for some form ahead of Augusta. The Englishman comes alive at this time of year, when looking to fine-tune his game ahead of the year’s first major and this has been a positive stop for him so far in his still relatively short career.
4202	4202	36	36	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The latter three are all outside the top 120 in the world rankings, so if they can....    Oosthuizen didn't have his best stuff at the Masters (T41) but had been in decent nick before that while Grace has improved from T27 at Augusta National to T11 at The Heritage (like this, a Pete Dye track) before T10 in last week's Texas Open. In fact, Futureoffantasy.com's list of top 25 performers on Pete Dye courses shows Grace ranked 8th while he's third in the table measuring his Pete Dye numbers against Expected Strokes Gained elsewhere. It's Bermuda greens at TPC Louisiana and Oosthuizen performs relatively better on such surfaces than he does on other grass types.
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
5021	5021	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite having missed the cut here last year, Martin Laird does have two top ten finishes at this event in his five made cuts in his last six tries. I won’t be going all-in but I don’t hate the way vegas has priced Laird’s odds and it certainly makes for a relatively inexpensive golfer with real upside. Click To Enlarge!
416	416	7	7	target: Merritt 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First @APinv bet is @TROYMERRITT_PGA at 469/1. Merritt is a @PGATOUR winner and should enjoy his Bay Hill return where he was 3rd last year
487	487	13	14	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Josh Culp    @futureoffantasy    2016 Earnings: $16,457,054  2016 Rank: 7,987 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Rickie Fowler  Group 3: Gary Woodland  Group 4: John Senden    ANALYSIS: Plenty of course history here with 17 top 25s at TPC Boston between the foursome. Mo Yoshimoto    @Bears3423  2016 Earnings: $15,826,882  2016 Rank: 10,101 of 41,730  Group 1: Jason Day  Group 2: Adam Scott  Group 3: Billy Horschel  Group 4: Sean O'Hair    ANALYSIS: All four finished T13 or better last week so if they maintain their form then Mo is in for a great week. Yahoo!
13246	13246	15	15	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His short game rankings are good as well, which is a strong combination." No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head.
10977	10977	1	1	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week. Kokrak seemed to like Riviera the past two years, finishing 22nd and second.
12540	12540	5	5	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			in 2013 and 2011 respectively. Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price.
3987	3987	22	22	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Moore was 32nd on Tour in strokes gained: putting for 2015-2016 and is 47th across his 26 measured rounds this year. Branden Grace $10,000  Grace finished tied for ninth at TPC San Antonio last year. The South African tied for 11th with three rounds in the 60s at the RBC Heritage last week and tied for 27th at Augusta National in his start prior.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship
1716	1716	10	10	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some early observations from the @DraftKings prices for the WGC-Mexico: DJ and Thomas are far and away the top two,… https://t.co/3vuhD74OJh
11456	11456	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Tony Finau  Using narrative to influence picks rarely is accurate, although it can be quite fun. While it’s not Mexico City levels of elevation, Finau’s Utah upbringing could prove to be an advantage when it comes to adjusting to distance control on the fly. Remember, could.
8636	8636	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As you can see, there is one category absent from that list, putting. Haas ranked a dissapointing 67th out of a total 69 players in SG: Putting, which put to sword any chances of him contending. The positive news is that last time out at the Dell Tech Championship, Haas ranked 10th in SG: Putting, as well as inside the top-15 for SG: Tee-to-Green, Approach and Around-the-Green.
9139	9139	40	41	target: Patton Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
788	788	25	25	target: Piercy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			He ranks 10th in SG tee to green, 30th in SGP, 15th SG off the tee. With a solid record here and decent current form Piercy could be worth a look here. Grayson Murray 55/1  This guy looks an incredible future prospect and comes to Vegas in superb form.
4832	4832	26	27	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			299 yards (14th), 50.0% fairways (54th), 70.8% greens in regulation (17th), proximity to hole 34'8" (59th), 85.7 % scrambling (1st), 1.65 putts per GIR (4th). 2015, Chris Kirk (-12). 277 yards (41st), 50.0% fairways (60th), 63.9% greens in regulation (62nd), proximity to hole 33'9" (57th), 61.5 % scrambling (39th), 1.57 putts per GIR (1st).
10642	10642	22	22	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That includes a win at the Farmers Insurance Open two weeks back and a 5th at the Australian Open in late November. Day also enters with strong event form, having finished 6th, cut, 4th, 11th, and 5th since 2013 here. Day's birdie ability (fourth among the field in birdie or better rate over the past 12 weeks, according to FantasyGolfMetrics) puts him firmly in play with the big boys at the top.
756	756	12	12	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Whilst it is hard to back a player who played the way Walker did last week, he’s played well in a similar situation. In 2014, Walker had just finished 63rd at the Frys.com Open one week before, then went on to post his best finish of T4 here. It is hard to ignore his poor performance last week, but that is clearly factored into his 50/1 price.
9587	9587	1	1	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. Spieth won this event in 2016 and that’s good enough for us. Any further examination of his resume is unnecessary at this point, maybe even insulting.
171	171	9	10	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And my man wants to sing. Bob Harig -- Jason Day ($12,400)  The defending champion won at a different course last year, but he's more than suited to perform well on brutish Bethpage Black. Ranked No.
10190	10190	15	15	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Length is I think a big part of playing out here. As for current form, Finau has been in fine fettle since the second half of last season. After a top five in Canada, his final six starts of 2017 read: 7-7-2-26-11-16.
8921	8921	28	28	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At only $8,800, he’s a golfer to keep your eye on in the swing season and is a great value this week on DK. MY SLEEPER : Aaron Wise ($7,100)  Wise is one of the new Web.com grads teeing it up this week on the PGA. The 21-year-old enjoyed a storied college career and has seamlessly worked his way into a full PGA membership for 2017, with wins on the Mackenzie Tour and Web.com Tour over the past year or so.
6246	6246	23	23	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, in a weak field like this, you are forced to roster golfers in cash that you wouldn’t necessarily do in stronger fields. Finau is playing solid golf and TPC Potomac is played on bentgrass greens so that should help Finau a bit. Finau ranks 3rd in GIR%, 5th in SG:T2G, 10th in BoB%, and 14th in Par 4 Scoring.
4435	4435	21	22	target: Patrick Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hudson Swafford at 200/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - confidence growing after maiden win this year and local ties a boost  1pt e.w. Patrick Cantlay at 100/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) - chance now to show off a rare talent and eyecatching form in Florida  Click here for our transparent tipping record. There have been one or two head-scratching results at the PLAYERS Championship down the years but proven top-level form from an established star or a rapid improver has been the general order of the day.
10773	10773	17	18	target: Nick Watney. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not liking a four-time winner of the event while he’s in form would be odd, no? Sleeper: Nick Watney. He boasts a strong record here (three top 10s) and it seems he’s rounding into form.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
10544	10544	25	25	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is why it's fun, but that's also self-evident. As I brusquely averred in Tuesday's Facebook Live fantasy show, the only reason you don't burn Matsuyama at TPC Scottsdale is because you already have elsewhere. I'm looking at you, Ben, although Everill banked Matsuyama's T4 at Kapalua, so he might get the last laugh.
12274	12274	26	26	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is not in bad form at all, so 14/1 is plenty fair enough and I am happy to make him pick of the week here. Day has drawn Louis Oosthuizen, Jason Dufner and James Hahn in his group, and whilst this certainly could have been an easier draw, it doesn’t change my mind about his winning chances. He’s already proven he can beat Oosthuizen whilst Dufner and Hahn are unpredictable players, who of course can get hot, but in this format, I’ll take Day every time.
5717	5717	32	32	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He finished T27 at The Masters at the end of April and followed that with a T11 at the RBC Heritage, a T10 in Texas and a respectable T24 in New Orleans. Grace is the kind of player that has proven he can really tough it out on the stiffer US Open tests with two top 10’s over the last two years. He finished T5 last year in Oakmont and came close to winning in Chambers Bay in 2015 but pulled his tee shot left on the 16th out of bounds which ended up costing him a double bogey.
11204	11204	16	16	target: Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has done well at PGA National, with top-15s in three of the past four years. Garcia is another guy you don't necessarily view as a steady player, but when you put aside some of his antics through the years, he really is. This will be Garcia's first action since a T32 in Dubai a month ago.
7323	7323	35	35	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
1425	1425	30	30	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think he’ll be low owned and could pay off big time. Here is a LU I entered into the PGA $200K Birdie on Draft Kings:  Walker $9,900  Snedeker $9,700  Dufner $7,700  Kisner $7,400  McGirt $7,900  Tanihara $6,400    Leaving $1,000 on the table to play with. Best of luck!
3720	3720	22	22	target: Kisner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First and foremost, Snedeker is very good when he does get a sniff. Secondly, I want to split stakes and back Kevin Kisner, too. It was here two years ago that Kisner finally lived up to the billing of his high school coach, who reckoned he'd never seen anyone tougher under the gun.
2459	2459	34	34	target: Walker, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two. Click To Enlarge!
6148	6148	38	39	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Overall though, scoring conditions will likely be ideal throughout, so expect regular low scores here and possibly something in the high teens to win. Last six winners  2016 –- Russell Knox -14 (over Jerry Kelly -13)  2015 — Bubba Watson -16 (over Paul Casey in playoff)  2014 — Kevin Streelman -15 (over Sergio Garcia and KJ Choi -14)  2013 — Ken Duke -12 (over Chris Stroud in playoff)  2012 — Marc Leishman -14 (over Charley Hoffman and Bubba Watson -13)  2011 — Fredrik Jacobson -20 (over Ryan Moore and John Rollins -19)  Winning Trends  Four of the last seven winners of the Travelers have been first-time winners on the PGA Tour. Three of the last four winners of this event were coming into the week off of missed cuts in their previous start.
364	364	6	6	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Currently 10th in the FEC standings, Mickelson won here in 2007, has only missed the cut here once in 9 appearances and was 10th here in 2011 plus 4th here in 2012. Mickelson, under the tutelage of Andrew Getson, has been fascinating to watch in 2016. At 66th in the PGA Tour Driving Distance stats, Phil has taken an average of 6 yards off of his driving to hit more fairways in a bid to hit far more greens.
2029	2029	0	1	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jimmy Walker $8,800 – Fiction. As you can see above, I think that fading Walker is incredibly ill-advised. Of course, I’ll applaud you later when it pans out, but for now I think Walker is safe to use heavily in a projected bounce-back week.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
8252	8252	16	17	target: Chad Campbell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Streelman ranks 12th in Par 4 Scoring, 23rd in SG:T2G and Scrambling, and 24th in BoB%. Chad Campbell ($7,900) – Campbell has been playing solid golf and making cuts. Continue to ride the form until it loses steam.
10976	10976	23	23	target: Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
7613	7613	35	36	target: Patrick Rodgers 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The results of events following a major tend to be fairly wide open because of the weaker base of players playing in these events. The first potential value that stands out on this chart is Patrick Rodgers who has roughly 60:1 odds to win this week despite a mere $7,000 price tag. The same can also be said for Daniel Summerhays who is in nearly an identical boat.
765	765	12	12	target: Molinari 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Can't wait for Webb Simpson Chalk mania this week.. On another note, Molinari is a guy I like heading into this complete unknown course
8923	8923	11	11	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While it’s often good to take a wait-and-see approach with golfers, Wise is someone I would not recommend waiting too long on as his pedigree suggests he won’t take long to adapt to his next level of competition. The course this week does seem to award aggressive play, which works in Wise’s favor as he is plenty long off the tee (averaged over 315 yards per drive) and ranked first in eagles made and 14th in birdies made last season on the Web.com Tour. At just $7,100, he makes for a solid tournament pick this week and is a golfer to track as we progress through the seven-week swing season.
541	541	6	6	target: Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
6657	6657	29	30	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Throw in his wildness off the tee -- a shortcoming that's severely penalized at the Greenbrier -- and I'm staying away. Expert Picks  Kevin Kisner  Danny Lee  Keegan Bradley  Bill Haas  Patrick Reed  Sung Kang  Gary Woodland  Xander Schauffele  Webb Simpson  Russell Henley  Pinterest Icon Sportswire  Expert Explanation : Does Kisner even need rationale? Kisner has six top-10 finishes on the season, and was a runner-up the last time this event was played.
462	462	7	7	target: Weekley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I'm e/w on D Lee, Cejka &amp; Weekley (long shot) in Puerto Rico this week. See their stats (&amp; everyone else's!) on Golf Predictor. #bettingtips
8370	8370	34	35	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My Weekly Finalists:  My Favorites: You can see the entire list at mikeglasscott.com  Since none of the above are playing this week, time to get creative. My Choice: Webb Simpson  Close Second: Ryan Moore, Bill Haas  Outliers: Lucas Glover, Kyle Stanley, Haotong Li  Gut Shot(s): Kevin Na, Brandon Hagy  Rank Outsiders: Peter Malnati, William McGirt  QUESTION(S) OF THE WEEK:  Remember, if you don’t see a guy in my choices, it’s more than likely that I have already selected them. Who do I save???
5014	5014	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau has an initial projected ownership of under 20% yet has consistently outperformed his salary time in and time out this season. Since his switch from Nike equipment, Finau has been a completely changed golfer. I will continue to jump on the Finau train and sing his praises until I run out of money.
3535	3535	59	59	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Add in 1st in Driving Distance, 1st for Greens In Regulation and 21st in Scrambling and he really is the complete package. One hugely important factor at the Masters - and this is the final clincher with Johnson - is being able to avoid the big numbers. Check out the Bogey Avoidance stats for this season and you'll see DJ in fifth place.
6873	6873	39	40	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In-Play Tactics    Moore sat third after round one and he was never headed form halfway but don't worry if your fancy has a poor first round as a slow start can be overcome at Deere Run. Steve Stricker and Zach Johnson have both won recently having trailed by seven strokes after round one and Spieth trailed by six after the opening day in 2013 and by eight two years later! Spieth was still five back at halfway in 2015 and he trailed by six shots after round three in 2013.
2153	2153	40	40	target: Dustin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera hasn’t been a place where players suddenly “find their games” and as the sort main event of the West Coast swing, emphasizing players who have performed well at the previous few events is not a bad idea. Stud Picks  Dustin Johnson ($11,400): Hard to argue with Dustin at all this week. Some point to Pebble Beach as his favorite course but this venue might actually suit him better.
2385	2385	35	36	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fresh off a week in which he finished T-17 on a course that didn't exactly suit his game, Donald should be licking his chops to get back to the friendly confines of Florida. Bob Harig: Adam Scott ($12,200)  The defending Honda Classic champion has not finished worse than a tie for 14th in 10 of his past 11 starts worldwide. But he hasn't won during that stretch, either, lurking along ranked seventh in the world.
931	931	43	44	target: Jason Bohn. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The PGA Tour hops down from Las Vegas to Mexico, in the Cancun area, for the OHL Classic at Mayakoba. El Camaleon hosts again, with Graeme McDowell defending the title he somewhat surprisingly won last year in a playoff against Russell Knox and Jason Bohn. For GNN Plus subscribers, you can access our NEW searchable database of PGA Tour results from 2011-present, our top-15 finish chart and season-long trends on DraftKings valuations.
5171	5171	21	22	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We want to target the golfers with the highest BoB% as that is where you can really accumulate points. Core Plays  Adam Scott ($16,600) – Love the way Scott has been playing lately. He comes into the Memorial Tournament with a top 10 at the Masters and PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP to go with a 4th place finish here last year.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
2287	2287	9	10	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looks like a good time to jump back on. Justin Rose – $8,400  Hear me out for a second. No, Justin Rose didn’t necessarily burn you last week, but you could say he underwhelmed.
9674	9674	22	22	target: Henley's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			He was 17th last week in a 34-man field, but that does mean that he played in Hawaii a week ago. In Henley's three top-17s, he gained strokes on the field tee-to-green. In his poor performances, he lost strokes tee to green.
1169	1169	31	32	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s supposed to be taking some time off for back issues — but he couldn’t resist the guaranteed large paycheck by playing in his own backyard — so approach with caution. Bubba Watson ($7,600): The defending champion is third in the field with a 312.8-yard LT DD, and he ranks seventh with a 68.6 LT Adj Rd Score. His 6.7 percent Odds to Win are the best among this middle third of golfers.
1633	1633	4	4	target: Aphibarnrat 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Lets go with 5/1 Aphibarnrat as well. #top20
1692	1692	3	3	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Honda Classic: Winner: Fleetwood (in a playoff) Top 10: Rory, Kizzire, Bernd Low Owned top 25: Lowry, The Barn Rat, Grayson
8226	8226	19	20	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Levitanimal  Adam Levitan created a course history model, which I’ve adjusted slightly. And for the second consecutive week, Rory McIlroy is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. McIlroy has won twice here and has finished 10th or better in all five of his most recent trips.
1619	1619	25	25	target: Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He could also only manage a T50 finish in his season opener, the Safeway Open. So why do I like the winless and seemingly inconsistent, Cauley this week? Well firstly the T3 finish last week is a huge factor.
1850	1850	24	24	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge. Given he was a late entry into the Farmers Insurance Open anyway, I am not too concerned he decided not to start.
13219	13219	29	30	target: Nick Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Positioned to pile on at Harbour Town ranked T29 in greens in regulation, T6 in proximity to the hole and 22nd in birdies-or-better percentage while lining up par breakers. Nick Watney … He's 153rd in the FedExCup standings and ending an 11-year hiatus at Harbour Town. As his 37th birthday looms on April 25, he seems to be in no-man's land in his career.
6583	6583	10	10	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There are plenty of cheap options out there to fit Reed into your lineup. A win is coming soon for Reed, and the week of Independence Day seems like a fitting time for it. James Hahn – $8,800  In a week where Tony Finau looks to be the chalk, James Hahn will garner next to no ownership in a spot he could easily go off in.
10715	10715	0	1	target: Nick Watney 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Nick Watney … The most felicitous meeting of land and sea (according to Robert Louis Stevenson and, well, anyone else who has ever visited the Monterey Peninsula) sets up once again to be an elixir for the 36-year-old who hasn't recorded a top 25 since early summer. Save the 2016 edition of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am when he was sidelined with an injured back, the Sacramento native has been a regular here since 2004. With three top 10s among 10 cuts made, it's easy to understand why.
204	204	40	41	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The tournament has suffered a bit in recent years as it’s place on the schedule falls shortly after the Masters and right before the Players. This year it has managed to attract the best player in the world however in Dustin Johnson, but the pickings are kind of slim field-wise after DJ. We’ll get a look at Adam Scott, who is only making his fifth start in 2017, but will only have seven players in the field total who fall within the top 30 in the OWGR.
170	170	23	23	target: Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song. And my man wants to sing.
3310	3310	28	29	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has top 20 upside this here this week and is a really nice value at only $7,300, that can be used in both cash games and GPPs. Jason Dufner: (7,100) Dufner is another player who is just way too cheap for how consistent he has been this season. The 70th ranked player in the world has been great, only missing one cut this season, and finishing no worse than T25 in all of the events he has made the cut.
4126	4126	9	9	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jimmy Walker – $10,500  In a week where there is no clear cut favorite at the top, or no obvious missed priced golfer at the top to hoard all the ownership, pivoting to Jimmy Walker makes a ton of sense. On FanShareSports.com, Walker has only accumulated 11 tags, 18th most this week.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
780	780	17	17	target: Johnston 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Wells Fargo bets: McGirt 40-1 Simpson 40-1 Haas 40-1 Reed 55-1 Longshots, T-20s Varner 100-1 Lingmerth 150-1 Johnston 150-1 Kizzire 150-1
512	512	8	8	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			FanDuel is giving us a nice discount on Spieth this week by including DJ in their field for the @ShellHouOpen who WD earlier today.
12860	12860	1	1	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Rose  Rose should slightly edge out Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods as the highest-owned golfer in the DraftKings Fantasy Golf Millionaire. And I’m aware that almost every Masters picks article you’ll read will be on Rose, but there’s a reason for that. The Brit has a lethal combination of recent form and course form, and he brings an exceptionally good value.
1409	1409	6	6	target: Cabrera-Bello. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			I see @DraftKings brought back Chalka Cabrera-Bello.
407	407	0	1	target: Bud Cauley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley 145/1 - 16th in Strokes Gained: Approach this year. Made the 10th most birdies in the field at the Honda.
947	947	15	15	target: Power 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			First look at the #RSMClassic board, few long shots sticking out. Cook 80-1 Tway 100-1 Power 125-1 Wise 125-1 Ha… https://t.co/9aSkYXRGx2
666	666	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He only has one appearance at East Lake, and I think that will affect his ownership. If you are selecting Dustin Johnson at the top, Charl will be in the ideal price range as a player to pair with him, and I think he has some really nice upside for GPPs. Zachary Turcotte -- Kevin Na ($6,500)  Is Kevin Na going to win this week?
712	712	163	164	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Armour / Ted Potter Jnr; 3) Tyler Duncan; 4) Ben Crane; 5) Webb Simpson; 6) Ryan Moore; 7) Ken Duke; 8) Zach Johnson; 9) Corey Conners; 10) Emiliano Grillo / David Hearn; 12) Rob Oppenheim; 13) Chez Reavie; 14) Vaughn Taylor; 15) Kevin Na / Conrad Shindler; 17) Jon Curran; 18) Keegan Bradley / Martin Laird; 20) Lucas Glover / Richy Werenski.

Spaun; 20) Zac Blair / Stephan Jaeger / Jason Kokrak / Ryan Moore / Rob Oppenheim. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Robert Garrigus; 2) Kevin Na; 3) Jason Gore / Andrew Landry; 5) Webb Simpson; 6) John Daly; 7) Brice Garnett; 8) Danny McCarthy / Peter Uihlein; 10) Roberto Diaz / Rory Sabbatini / Ricky Werenski; 13) Matt Every / Peter Malnati / Grayson Murray; 16) Rob Oppenheim; 17) Bronson Burgoon / Martin Laird / Martin Piller; 20) Nate Lashley.
814	814	4	4	target: Koepka, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Par 4 Scoring – Koepka, Castro, Cauley, McGirt, Simpson  3. Scrambling Average – Koepka, Murray, Tsung Pan, Blaum, Bryan  4. Birdie or Better % – DJ, McIlroy, Stenson, Koepka, Matsuyama, Scott  5.
229	229	1	1	target: Holmes 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			JB Holmes 40-1... has smoked Pebble a couple times, good on poa, always seems to take a few starts to round into best form
7675	7675	32	32	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Let’s jump into some picks. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  ELITE  Dustin Johnson ($11,800) – Wow, Jordan Spieth is the highest priced. I guess I get it, but for this course, give me DJ all day.
12540	12540	5	5	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			in 2013 and 2011 respectively. Kirk has never been a long hitter so he’ll need to take driver out (282.5 distance on all drives), but he’s T55 in Distance from Edge of the Fairway, and his approach game makes up for the lack of power off the tee. Statistically, Kirk is:  22 nd in SG: Approach  in SG: Approach 34 th in SG: Tee to Green  in SG: Tee to Green T47 in Proximity to the Hole  34th in Approach Shots Outside 200-Yards (26-under par in 108 attempts)  He struggles with the putter which explains his poor BoB%, but like List he’ll give himself enough opportunities to get to the green that he should more than pay off his price.
4460	4460	11	11	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His form here makes pretty grim reading, despite making 3/3 cuts. Grace has not managed to finish better than T42, as he seemingly struggles to put four rounds together here. In 2013 he posted a final round 77, to fall 30 places, after getting inside the top-10 earlier in the round.
12785	12785	2	3	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: T15  Phil Mickelson 2pts Win 20/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply**. Claim:  Call me sentimental but I also can't leave out Phil Mickelson at his favourite course. With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet.
11530	11530	79	80	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other than Dufner, this team is loaded with fantasy scorers that rack up birdies and eagles with the best of them.

Perez, Pat Perry, Kenny Pettersson, Carl Piller, Martin Points, D.A.
265	265	1	1	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Russell Knox ($7,500) – Bethpage Black simply isn’t a fit for a guy like Knox, but I would argue that TPC Boston most definitely is. Knox’s Achilles heel has always been the putter, but frankly, he’s been putting exceptionally and this course is all about tee-to-green anyway. Keep him on speed dial.
7812	7812	39	40	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I do think that Leishman will be somewhat popular, so he makes more sense for cash games, but he certainly has the potential to pop high enough to be worth a consideration in tournaments. Other Options: Bubba Watson (GPP), Adam Scott    Value Plays    Kevin Kisner (DK: $7,100, FD: $5,800)  Kisner has hit a rough patch in form, but Firestone seems like a course where he can get back on track. Kisner isn’t super long off the tee, but he is accurate and has one of the better approach games on tour.
651	651	18	18	target: CANTLAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			HUH 200/1: 9th Valspar, 3rd here, good $ CAMPOS 310/1: riding wave PETERSON 150/1: continue to like him CANTLAY 60/1: game fits, motivated
2523	2523	51	51	target: Fitzpatrick 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After that, he added seventh place on his WGC debut in China and last year’s similar finish on his first start as a professional at Augusta further demonstrates that he has the class to win this week, regardless of who else is in contention. As with so many of his age, Fitzpatrick is in and out so while a modest effort in the Honda Classic last week may raise some concerns, it’s no more relevant than a previous tie for fifth in the Dubai Desert Classic where he told reporters that his game had felt great for some time. Form at courses such as Fanling and Golf Club Milano further underlines that this week’s venue should prove suitable and there may not be many more chances to back Fitzpatrick in this sort of field at this sort of price.
7779	7779	20	20	target: Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's 4th in the field in strokes gained: approach in his past 24 rounds and 25th off the tee. Bubba Watson ($5,900 | 80/1) - Watson hasn't had the best results here in his seven tries since 2010, but he's finished top-30 six times: 22nd in 2010, 21st, 19th, 27th, 37th, 2nd, and 14th. That's a sturdy return at just $5,900.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
8161	8161	30	30	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I can see a top 10 or top five for him, which I really can’t see for many guys under $7,000. Webb Simpson (DK: $6,800, FD: $6,000)    Beyond McIlroy and Fowler, there isn’t another player in the field who has racked up the consistent results at Quail Hollow than Simpson. He is a member at the course and a Charlotte native who seems to love the hometown vibes.
4117	4117	43	44	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament. I wonder if this still plays on his mind from 2011
2032	2032	5	6	target: Chris Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pick of the week  Jon:  Chris Kirk $7,500 – I’m coming back to Kirk fountain and taking a drink. After missing the cut twice, Kirk came back and notched two top-40 performances. He’s notched a runner up here at Pebble in the past as well.
4997	4997	16	16	target: Barber 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the season, he's T20 in proximity, T45 in ball striking and 63rd in GIR. Blayne Barber - $6,900    Barber has not missed cut in a stroke-play event since February and is coming off a T16 at TPC Sawgrass (albeit a course he was very familiar with). Barber was T34 in his Colonial debut last year.
3763	3763	19	20	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			They are also played on TifEagle Bermuda. Past Winners  2017 Wesley Bryan  2016 Branden Grace  2015 Jim Furyk  2014 Matt Kuchar  2013 Graeme McDowell  2012 Carl Pettersson  2011 Brandt Snedeker  Key Statistics  If you couldn’t sense where we were going in the first few paragraphs, the key statistics this week will be geared towards accuracy. The first important statistic we are really digging into is Driving Accuracy.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.

3843	3843	2	2	target: Kaymer: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Martin Kaymer: Kaymer has not missed a cut in his last 28 starts worldwide. He’s coming off his best Masters finish (by far) as he finished T16 last week on the back of a final round 68.
11012	11012	12	12	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – Genesis Open  Lock of the week:  Paul Casey – $10,200 – The upper range on DraftKings presents some great options in this stellar field for the Genesis Open. We love the way Casey fits into GPP and cash lineups allowing you to avoid the fairly weak $6K range. He finished T8 last week at Pebble while leading the field in SG:T2G.
1849	1849	22	22	target: Reed’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won the Wyndham Championship with -14, shot -28 at the Humana Challenge (Now CareerBuilder) and -21 at the Tournament of Champions. Reed’s last win was in the FedEx Cup play-offs last year, when he was victorious at The Barclays  Before his below-par play last week, Reed was in fine form. In his first two starts in 2017, Reed finished T6 at the Tournament of Champions and T12 at the CareerBuilder Challenge.
1347	1347	26	26	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His $9,500 price allows you to pair a bunch of mid-salary players instead of dipping into the $6,000s. Justin Rose ($9,300)  You can pair him with Casey or pivot from Casey to Rose. Either way works as both are priced low enough.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
1189	1189	7	7	target: Hadwin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Backed @ahadwingolf at 55/1 in the @cbgolfchallenge. Hadwin has finished second and sixth in the last 2 years at th… https://t.co/hojIe8sYZG
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
1676	1676	9	9	target: Woodland, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For a player who hits it as long as Woodland, his ranking of 59th in scrambling is very underrated. Woodland ranked 30th in SG:App last season and 23rd in GIR. He is coming off of a sixth-place finish in the Sony Open two weeks ago and will look to keep up his great playing this week.
11805	11805	27	27	target: Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Picks to win  Ryan Moore  I was tempted to pick Tiger Woods here, but -- spoiler alert -- I'll save that one for next week. Instead, the pick is Moore, who arrives at the intersection of form and familiarity.
5435	5435	14	14	target: Cink 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is too much risk and barely any upside with Gay this week. Stewart Cink – $8,000  I have been a big Stewart Cink guy in the past, but that was when he was priced in the mid to high $6K range and presented solid cut making ability. Now Cink is priced at $8,000, making it very difficult to build a solid looking cash lineup, especially when he use to be your sub $7K punt.
7223	7223	30	31	target: Justin Rose. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s been flying under the radar since his Masters runner-up, but he has history at Royal Birkdale and his Irish Open T-4 should prime him for his second major title. Justin Rose. He’s been flying under the radar since his Masters runner-up, but he has history at Royal Birkdale and his Irish Open T-4 should prime him for his second major title.
7174	7174	23	23	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think Sergio sees a lot of ownership because of this but I will still be overweight on him for the week. Henrik Stenson – GPP – DK: $9600 FD: $8700  Stenson is quietly showing good form just in time to defend his Open Championship title. With a T10 and a T26 in his last two events, I am not worried about his earlier season struggles.

459	459	29	29	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Here are five competitors in this week’s Masters who are generally considered green jacket contenders, but I’ll be avoiding. All odds are via 5dimes as of Tuesday afternoon  Jon Rahm (+2235)  That’s right: I’m kicking this thing into high gear right off the bat by recommending a fade of the world’s third-ranked golfer. Since his victory in Palm Springs three months ago, Rahm has failed to post another top-10 finish in five starts, including an early exit at the WGC-Match Play in his most recent start.
11776	11776	11	11	target: Wise, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That leaves plenty of room for boom-or-bust options at the bottom. Wise, Hossler, and Burns are all youngsters with top-10 potential while Woods is just too cheap still. Mo Yoshimoto  “@BearsGolf3423”  Last Week Points: 491.5  Last Week Rank: 4128  Jordan Spieth ($33,300)  Luke List ($21,000)  Byeong Hun An ($18,800)  Steve Stricker ($13,800)  Tiger Woods ($6,500)  Sam Burns ($6,500)    Analysis: Also going with the combo of Woods and Burns at the bottom.

107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
261	261	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This course is definitely hard enough to punish even some of the very best, so I would still consider it to be a potentially palatable investment opportunity. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Jason Day ($12,500) and Dustin Johnson ($12,100) – I hate to sound like a broken record here, but these two simply cannot be bested in terms of their sheer combination of power, accuracy, and precision. While they both bear some risk at their salary levels, I think it would be outrageous to fade them with their current form and proven ability to take this course apart.
6534	6534	1	1	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sky Walker is coming off two missed cuts in a row, but those were at the U.S. Open and last week, where the winning score was -7. This course will give Walker some confidence, knowing his scoring average around the place is 68.31. -- Michael Collins  DraftKings value picks  Nick Taylor  Taylor has been on a pretty hot run the past month or so, and we're going back to the well at this price.

8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
10084	10084	34	34	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He had to miss the U.S Open (although for good reason, his daughter’s graduation), separated from his longtime caddie Jim “Bones” McKay, and was cut from the final two majors. Believe it or not, Mickelson has not won on Tour since his British Open victory in 2013. It doesn’t matter what event or how strong the field, Mickelson wants to win, now.
202	202	12	12	target: English 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Racing Post - Steve Palmer - Farmers - 2ew Woodland 40-1; 1ew English 90-1, Finau 66-1, Grillo 66-1; 0.5ew M Kim 200-1, Rodgers 175-1
9007	9007	6	7	target: Justin Thomas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fact and figures  Course record: 61, Justin Thomas, round two in 2015-16 season. Most Birdies: 30, Justin Thomas, 2015-16. He made 29 last year.
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
3692	3692	89	89	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It makes sense given the way he strikes the ball - "when I think about my ball flight I hit it pretty low, that's why a lot of people say Augusta is not really the place for me - and this really does look the ideal place for the 28-year-old to get back on track after an indifferent start to the season. Leaving Augusta on such a positive note should be the perfect prep and, as we've seen during his seven European Tour wins, when he gets in contention, Grace is an excellent closer. This is definitely a horses-for-courses event and if you look down the rollcall of champions you'll see five wins for Davis Love and two each for Stewart Cink, Jim Furyk and Boo Weekley.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.
60	60	10	10	target: Hadwin. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two cheap guys I think will do well: Summerhays and Hadwin. I really like Hadwin this week. #dfs #DBChampionship
4075	4075	8	9	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We love Finau in cash or GPP contests. Luke List $7,600 – List missed the cut last week at The Heritage at a course that was NOT suited for him, but was in tremendous form prior. He was owned around 15 percent in most DraftKings GPPs and may go a little under utilized this week.
13232	13232	9	10	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His record speaks for itself so he should contend. Matt Kuchar – Kuch hasn’t missed a cut here in his last 14 starts and, of course, won four years ago. Also played well reasonably well at Augusta.
12056	12056	4	4	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			-- Zach Turcotte  Luke List  The Arnold Palmer Invitational sets up to be another good spot for Luke List after quality fantasy performances in the Valspar Championship, Honda Classic, Genesis Open, Waste Management Phoenix Open and Farmers Insurance Open. Rating near the top in BOB% and Par-5 Scoring, List should do his fair share of scoring at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge. He also has shown decent upside in this event when his complete game is working, as evidenced by his T17 finish last year.

12008	12008	3	3	target: Rose, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Justin Rose, Tiger Woods and Emiliano Grillo. Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times.
11638	11638	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Remember, could. A better case for Finau is his skill set and recent form. One of the PGA Tour’s premier bombers, Finau actually has been better with his irons and short game lately.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
11010	11010	22	22	target: Mickelson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Leishman comes with all the safety of a top-tier play but carries a much more palatable price. Chez Reavie ($8,000)  Similar to Mickelson, Chez Reavie has been sizzling over the last two weeks. After a narrow loss in a playoff two weeks ago in Phoenix, Reavie followed that up with a T-2 in Pebble Beach.
1718	1718	5	5	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
7398	7398	1	2	target: Kevin Tway 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			VALUE  Kevin Tway ($7,700) – You do need to be at least reasonably in the fairway at Deere Run, unless you’re Kevin Tway, in which case you just do whatever you want because you absolutely annihilate the ball off the tee. Tway should be able to make this course his long-drive playground with near impunity, and that’s scary for the rest of the field. Buy him up.
11801	11801	12	12	target: Reavie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That means we need to take advantage of that type of thinking. Reavie is in play in all formats for me this week. -- Taras Pitra  Jason Dufner  Copperhead is a course that sets up nicely for an accurate player off the tee and approaching the green as well as somebody who can putt.
12801	12801	15	15	target: Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the bookmakers being particularly stringent with their odds in 2018, I can't realistically cover Day, Casey and Mickelson each-way, so will include the 3-time winner as a win-only bet. A top-8 place across Day or Casey brings home profit and we have Phil on side as well if he grabs the victory. Naturally you can treble your odds with 888Sport's exclusive new customer offer as per the details at the top of the page if you prefer.
2546	2546	6	6	target: Willett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Accepting that he could play poorly, Willett simply looks overpriced at 125/1 and on a course which really should suit, that’s enough for me. Rafa Cabrera-Bello is another frequent contender on the European Tour’s tighter courses and he's a factor here at 100/1, but again that’s a price which says his consistency should be considered a more valuable asset than Willett’s class and with four rounds for everyone, I’m not sure that’s the case. Instead, I like the look of Tommy Fleetwood at twice the price.
12778	12778	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			283 yards (40th), 66.1% fairways (31st), 68.1% greens in regulation (19th), 69.6% scrambling (1st), 1.61 putts per GIR (8th). 2010, Phil Mickelson (-16). 297 yards (2nd), 60.7% fairways (45th), 75.0% greens in regulation (3rd), 77.8% scrambling (3rd), 1.76 putts per GIR (10th).
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1046	1046	14	14	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#SentryTOC Card 💰💰💰 Kiz 28-1 Harman 35-1 Bryson 66-1 Dufner 80-1 Si WOOOOOO 100-1 Cook 100-1 *EW on Bryson and below
11466	11466	28	28	target: Rahm, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So did Justin Thomas, who tied for fifth with Thomas Pieters, who was the runner-up at Riviera two weeks prior. Only Ross Fisher, who tied for third with Rahm, entered in so-so form. To refresh: Mexico City is more than 7,500 feet above sea level, meaning the 7,300-yard track will play more like 6,500.
3028	3028	25	25	target: DeLaet: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I am hoping Poston goes overlooked by the others in this range so we can be ahead of the field on this talented youngster. Graham DeLaet: Which Graham at the top are you choosing? DeLaet burned quite a few people last week but is still going to be super chalky this week.. DeLaet comes in ranked 71st in SG: Tee to Green, 38th in GIR%, 28th in Approaches from >200, and 42nd in BoB%.
7041	7041	8	9	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			lineup: Kevin Streelman, Steve Stricker, Charles Howell III, Brian Harman (Starters); Smylie Kaufman, Jamie Lovemark, Daniel Summerhays, Wesley Bryan (Bench). Knockout/One-and-done pick: Brian Harman. RELATED: The Golf Digest Tournament Predictor  WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS
8806	8806	19	19	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You'd fancy backing him anywhere at the moment but this tournament must rank amongst his favourites given recent visits. Rose didn't make it last year but in the previous four years finished 2-4-6-2. "I really enjoy this golf course.
5513	5513	32	32	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions. Day's US Open form reads an impressive 2-59-2-4-9-8, so with eight places up for grabs; he looks to have an outstanding chance to reward each-way backers for the fifth time in seven renewals at an industry best price of 14/1. How Erin Hills is going to play this week is a bit of an unknown.
12575	12575	35	35	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He will always be a popular player in terms of ownership, and generally the highest priced golfer gets a little bump just because. I will much rather spend the $100 less for the lower owned Rose who likely has a greater win probability. Luke List – $9,600  Welcome to Luke List chalk week.
7700	7700	14	14	target: Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it. Sleeper: Russell Henley.
7124	7124	26	27	target: Francesco Molinari, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
5269	5269	13	13	target: Cantlay 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Consider him a solid value although not a great bet to win. Patrick Cantlay $7,800 – Cantlay has been a little overpriced this season at times, but we love the value at this week’s event in addition to his excellent form. He hasn’t missed a cut and has thrown in two T10’s.
13247	13247	2	2	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			No doubt Johnson stands out among this so-so field, but we respectfully disagree. Johnson hasn't played the tournament since 2009, and has never made the cut in Hilton Head. Moreover, his lack of driving accuracy (140th) and iffy iron game (60th in strokes gained: approach) forecast trouble.
885	885	4	4	target: Lindheim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			@joshuaperry22 @SmartGolfBets I'm on Lindheim one more week after a 7th last week. And speaking of POWER...
591	591	8	9	target: Luke List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ThePME Not going to be original but like Luke List this week. T13 at both RSM and Sony, T10 last year's Honda so c… https://t.co/fHmZPLhbnL
3197	3197	10	10	target: Hoffman 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Full First Round Leader stats are here . 2016 - Hoffman - PM -8/64. 2015 - Piercy - AM -9/63.
7706	7706	21	22	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His play has been strong all year, and as his record proves, Firestone is a good track for him. Also like: Adam Scott, Branden Grace and Alex Noren. The Aussie is a past champ and has mostly been in good form this year.
11769	11769	18	19	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since 2009, Kuchar has made seven appearances at this venue and never finished outside of the top 40. Jason Dufner – Cash – DK: $7800 FD: $10100  Dating back to 2009 Jason Dufner has never finished outside of the top thirty at this event. Add in the fact that Dufner has made 12 straight cuts at events with a cut and Dufner is a cash lock for me this week.
8326	8326	543	544	target: Billy Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The MDF rule is in effect if more than 78 golfers make the original cut.

12383	12383	50	50	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As Rory showed us last weekend a world class player with putting struggles can turn the corner at any time and it’s just possible that in the two weeks since his missed cut at the Valspar Spieth will have ‘found something’, however on current form you would have to give Reed a great chance in this match up. Neither of the other two opponents in the group will push overs of course but again I would fancy Reed to come through. After this if seedings went to plan Reed would come up against Alex Noren in the last 16 and Hideki Matsuyama in the last eight.

747	747	33	34	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Superior iron players will be rewarded with the appropriate birdie putt volume needed to keep up with the ridiculous scoring pace required to contend here, regardless of their length. DRAFTKINGS PICKS FOR CONSIDERATION  Kevin Na ($9,500) – If you can believe it, this is actually an event Kevin Na won back in 2011 with a ridiculous score of -23, and it’s easy to see why. If length is taken out of the equation, Na has one of the best combinations of iron play and putting in the game.
330	330	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed — It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it’s hard to see why he doesn’t deserve a look again this week. He’s in America Mode.
5227	5227	29	29	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His missed cut will still be hurting those he burned, and his price tag this week won’t be drawing them back in. $8,700 is a lot to pay for Dufner at this event, but he will not have any ownership on him this week so rostering 5% of him will likely put you overweight on him. He has made three straight cuts at Memorial and I expect him to start another cut making streak this week.
4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
4556	4556	6	7	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			What better time than the PLAYERS. Rickie Fowler – $9,300  It is all or nothing for Rickie Fowler at TPC Sawgrass. Literally.
7239	7239	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Therefore, an ideal candidate would be an experienced American, who teed it up at Dundonald Links last week. There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance.
950	950	14	14	target: Knox 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here is a nice hole-by-hole tour from the course’s website. High End Picks  Russell Knox $11,800  No more middle-of-the-field pricing for Knox this week as he’s by far the most expensive player on the board. It’s hard to deny the incredible run he’s been on since winning the Travelers Championship and he has elite course history that culminated in a T2 finish last year, but his price tag may be a bit too much.

1794	1794	17	18	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Here's why: In his last five appearances at Phoenix, he's gone T17, T2, T2, 15th and T5. Matt Kuchar ($7,400)  Kuchar is making his 2017 debut this week. We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
10123	10123	39	39	target: Chez 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m always of the belief that putting can turn around almost immediately week to week, so targeting the top iron players at a course that doesn’t penalize lack of distance off the tee is a perfect spot for a Chez breakthrough. Reavie has 12th- and 17th-place ties in the last two years at the CareerBuilder, too. Webb Simpson  Happy learned how to putt.

10729	10729	24	25	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Solid off the tee and great with his irons in the coastal breezes, Perez should continue building upon his past successes at Pebble Beach. Patrick Reed ($7.9K) – Patrick Reed is starting to pour on the swag game with finishes of 23rd and 17th his last two outings. He’s doing it all with his approach game and putting.

After winning on the poa annua greens of Torrey Pines a couple of weeks ago along with his excellent record here, Day looks a good shout here at 10’s. Patrick Reed 33/1  Patrick Reed looks to be trending in the right direction lately and could be a player to keep on side this week.
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
4112	4112	29	29	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He missed the cut last week at the Heritage but will expect to bounce back at a course where his form figures read 3-MC-3-4 in his last four starts. Horschel loves the course and recently stated on Twitter that “It’s one of my favs of the year. Big fan of the course and the tournament staff that runs the event.
5219	5219	1	1	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bill Haas – $6,900  Bill Haas was $6,900 last week at the Dean and Deluca, and it was one of the major topics in the DFS golf world. He finished T12 last week, a solid result for Haas who had shown a string of poor form. Once again Haas is priced at $6,900, showing good form and is entering an event he has had two top 10s and a top 15 at in the last four years.
5606	5606	7	7	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler getting his first is another. Johnson defending this tournament might be the biggest of all, though. The real question is not, "can he?"
5989	5989	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed ($9,500): Reed may not have the razor sharp approach game that Casey has but he should be a good fit this week regardless as he can make up strokes at this venue with his improving short game and putter. Reed has a boom or bust history at this event with two top-twenties and two missed cuts over his last four appearances but I’m comfortable using him here as the real American hero has only finished outside of the top 25 once in his last six starts. Kyle Stanley ($8,400): I’m not sure if Stanley necessarily has what it takes to win at this venue, but like Casey his approach game can be so good at times that a shaky putter shouldn’t matter too much.
4032	4032	20	20	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His game sets up well again this week and should be a consideration for tournament contests. -- Taras Pitra  Chris Kirk  His current form is not good, as Kirk has missed cuts in three of his past four events played. However, Kirk is still a top-100 in the world player and has finished 13th and eighth here at Valero the past two seasons.

5716	5716	22	23	target: Branden Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can keep the ball in short grass off the tee, Pieters looks good value to have a good week here. Branden Grace 40/1  The South African has been coming into some good form lately and has proven himself to be a great wind player. He finished T27 at The Masters at the end of April and followed that with a T11 at the RBC Heritage, a T10 in Texas and a respectable T24 in New Orleans.
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.

Jimmy Walker (+7,500)  Jimmy Walker captured the imagination of golf fans everywhere with his stunning victory in the PGA Championship last year. Walker endured a 36-hole finale at Baltusrol, shooting 68-67 on the final day to hold off Jason Day’s late charge and win his first major title.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.

If you want help with PGA research for DraftKings check out the best fantasy tools out there at FantasyLabs.com  Adam Hadwin: (6,900) Hadwin has been one of my go to guys all season and I am not going to let his lack of course history pull me off him now. It is scary to think about playing someone who has never competed here at Augusta, but Hadwin has just been too good this season to be priced at $6,900, no matter the strength of the field.
154	154	11	11	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If I were playing #pga #dfs this week I would have Fowler in 100% my line ups. He is #1 in my @TFFDFS rankings. Matsu and Stenson high too.
1847	1847	6	6	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four starts at this event, Reed has finished 6-29-13-7, so he does plenty right here. His 7th on debut was bettered last year and if he is in the right frame of mind, Reed can definitely win here. We know low scoring is Reed’s forte, with three of his five wins coming by way of double-digit scores.
7577	7577	13	14	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Dustin Johnson – $12,200  Talking about the top player in the world in an extremely weak field, how original. Let’s just say that people are worried about Dustin Johnson’s game and his long trip over from Royal Birkdale to play in an event he probably could care less about.
13524	13524	40	40	target: Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a boom or bust play as demonstrated by three top 15’s and three missed cuts in his last six events, but that’s what you’re looking for in this price range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List).
1253	1253	44	44	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He won by masterfully playing the angles of the course, not to mention leading the field in strokes gained putting and finishing third in both scrambling and proximity to the hole (the greens are enormous, and simply doing well at GIR won't cut it). Reed was not even in the top-15 in SGP, but he was second in scrambling. So while it rarely hurts to hit it far off the tee -- which is why we tab driving distance as a key stat this week -- you'll be best served by focusing on short-game skill and putting.
700	700	6	6	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Main bets: Chappell 33-1 An 56-1 List 60-1 Cam Smith 110-1 DK article here, already added Curtis Luck... https://t.co/CDCTVal9Fh
4202	4202	36	36	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The latter three are all outside the top 120 in the world rankings, so if they can....    Oosthuizen didn't have his best stuff at the Masters (T41) but had been in decent nick before that while Grace has improved from T27 at Augusta National to T11 at The Heritage (like this, a Pete Dye track) before T10 in last week's Texas Open. In fact, Futureoffantasy.com's list of top 25 performers on Pete Dye courses shows Grace ranked 8th while he's third in the table measuring his Pete Dye numbers against Expected Strokes Gained elsewhere. It's Bermuda greens at TPC Louisiana and Oosthuizen performs relatively better on such surfaces than he does on other grass types.
3632	3632	23	23	target: Haas, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bernd Wiesberger 20% – Plays consistent tee to green golf and he’s made both of his cuts at Augusta because of it. Like Haas, one year his putter will catch fire and he’ll spike. THE SINGLES  Emiliano Grillo
576	576	33	34	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This wouldn’t quite be a Billy Horschel story of coming out of nowhere to win, but Casey would be a surprise winner, and makes for a good 2nd golfer in lineups this week. Patrick Reed (9,000)  Here is the past 9 events for Reed on Tour this season: 8 top 15 finishes (other one was a 22nd), a win, and 2 other Top 10 finishes. Reed is 2nd in the FedEx Cup Standings, but finds himself as the 7th highest priced golfer this week.
1068	1068	2	3	target: Brian Stuard 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sony Open: Brian Stuard and Brian Gay, both 125/1. Well they do say two Brians are better than one
9378	9378	27	27	target: Grayson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Having the winner in your lineups will be a must to win big on DraftKings. A low owned winner would be even better…  Best bargain basement option:  Grayson Murray $6,400 – If we stack ranked based on the fictional stat of “Strokes Gained: Aggression”, Grayson would be on top of the ranking in more facets than golf. Being aggressive is critical to playing well at Kapalua.
474	474	6	6	target: Uihlein 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Puerto Rico Open 🔥 takes: - Uihlein picks up the win - Varner with a top ten - Power with a top 20 - Flores with a top 25
8389	8389	32	32	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Seeing him in contention and eventually finishing inside the top-10 at Quail Hollow was enough for me to believe he can win this week, especially given his form on the correlating courses. Day has three top-10’s including a 2nd and a 3rd in his seven starts at Augusta National, whilst he also finished T24 and T4 at the 2012 and 2016 Barclays respectively. Day has won twice in the last nine play-off appearances he has now withdrawn from, with five more top-10’s and two top-15’s in the other six appearances.
12070	12070	24	24	target: List 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			And, as a bonus, you get him at a much better value than normal because of the bigger names in this field. Keegan Bradley/Luke List  If I’m going with the entire All Can’t Putt squad, I might as well toss on the bench players — Keegan and List. Over the past 24 rounds, Keegan is tops in the field tee-to-green, and List sits fourth.
2517	2517	18	19	target: Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Alex Noren (11th ranked player in the world, won at altitude last year)  High Upside Tournament Picks  Jason Dufner ($8,100): Coming off a decent week and his best finish on the year (14th) Dufner is the type of player I want to target this week as he’s great at finding the fairway with driver—11th in accuracy this year. Dufner’s had success at similar styled venues to this week as well and at $8,100 his price should drive people off him. Byeong-Hun An ($7,500): Great young player who took down a strong field in 2015 on another tree-lined venue at Wentworth.
8573	8573	4	4	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Instead, we are getting Day as only the seventh most expensive golfer on the slate, at an event he has not finished worse than T4 at the past three seasons. What’s also encouraging from his last start is that Day finished the week eighth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee and third in Driving Distance, suggesting he may finally have found some consistency with his driver, a club that has given him issues all season. Coming off a bit of an embarrassing finish, into an event and time of year he clearly likes, I like Day for a big week here and to hopefully nab his long overdue first win of the year.
2248	2248	28	29	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			[Writer’s Note: #MyEditorThoughtThisSpotWasReservedForHumbleBragging] [Editor’s Note: Only editors get to make notes.] Humpnostication Prognostication  If I were a skill game proposition guy, I would put my Coors Lite on Adam Scott ($10,300). He won here in 2005 and has been the runner-up at Rivera twice, including last year.
5271	5271	9	10	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’ll be high owned, so go big! Value Plays:  Kevin Kisner $7,600 – It’s no secret Kiz is in great form after winning the Dean & Deluca last week. He’s an excellent putter on bentgrass greens, which we will see again this week at Memorial.
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
9139	9139	41	41	target: Kizzire 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			George McNeill (2007), Marc Turnesa (2008) and Smylie Kaufman (2015) have all won this tournament on debut across the past 10 renewals. Indeed, since 2011, Tommy Gainey (3rd), Jonas Blixt (3rd), Ryo Ishikawa (2nd), Luke Guthrie (5th), Chesson Hadley (5th), Patton Kizzire (2nd), Brett Stegmaier (2nd) and Francesco Molinari (4th) have all finished in the each-way places on course debut. Guthrie, Hadley, Kizzire and Stegmaier were all new Tour graduates.
5564	5564	19	19	target: Schwartzel's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Although both played well and made the top 10, maybe a more restful week would have been better. Certainly, Schwartzel's mood appeared to be up and down and that doesn't bode well. So, we're left with just two players.
317	317	33	33	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks 15th in driving distance, first in SGP, 11th in SGTTG, fifth in par 4 scoring and third in par 5 scoring. With great current form and a near winner last week Day could go one better and win in style this week. Patrick Reed 25/1  The young American really stepped up to the plate last week and got the job done in Bethpage with a great win.
2414	2414	49	49	target: Kjeldsen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Kjeldsen is probably the most surprising since he comes in at nearly the min salary despite the fact that he ranks just outside the top 50 in the OWGR. Koepka and Willett are no strangers to winning and with higher salaries probably don’t have the same value pop as Kjeldsen but are certainly worth considering carefully this week. Click To Enlarge!
2756	2756	9	9	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pretty impressive for that course history we were emphasizing. Haas comes into the event in great recent form and is the top ranked player in the world in scrambling. Prior to the WGC-Mexico, Haas rolled out 6, yes 6, top 20’s in a row.
4569	4569	3	3	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to FanShareSports.com, Day is the 29th most tagged golfer so far this week and is the only golfer above $9K with single digit tags. In a week where there will be a ton of fresh faces to DFS golf due to the increase in contest sizes, Day makes for a fantastic GPP play. People will look at his recent form, combined with the recent form of golfers around him and steer clear.
4729	4729	28	28	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I cannot remember the last time I saw his price this low, along with his betting odds at 16/1, which seem long for a field of this strength. Day will be under owned once again, as the ownership at the top will drift towards DJ, Garcia and Koepka. If you want to make a pivot at the top, Day has to be the play because no one other than DJ has a better chance to win this tournament.
9218	9218	12	12	target: Taylor 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's going to be chalky at this price. -- Taras Pitra  Nick Taylor  In this week's edition of mispriced players, exhibit No. 1 is Taylor.
8089	8089	20	20	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In fact, the only thing that might cause him any confusion next Sunday is if Paul McCartney presents the trophy. Matsuyama may not know The Beatles very well – but how well do you know his career? Try our quiz to find out.
6278	6278	36	37	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He comes in 12th overall in my model this week due to his lower ranks in Par 4 Scoring(64th) and BoB%(47th) but ranks 13th in SG: OTT + APP which really draws my attention this week. Patrick Reed  World Golf Ranking (#17)  Vegas Odds (14/1)  Draftkings ($11,100)  FanDuel ($9,800)  If you are paying up for one golfer in the top tier this week, I prefer Patrick Reed who has some terrific form. Since missing three straight cuts in April, Reed has been not only consistent but has also been knocking on the door of another PGA Tour win.
1613	1613	12	12	target: Horschel 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: neutral			Honda update Knox 45 Berger 50 Ollie 55 Grillo 80 Wiesberger 80 Horschel 100
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
13317	13317	67	68	target: Si Woo’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Secondly as I mentioned earlier in the piece it may pay to look at a players past performance at the OHL Mayakoba as this is the other Greg Norman designed course played on the PGA Tour. Finally similarities have been drawn between the Oaks Course and Pete Dye design courses due to the run off areas around the greens and one thing we can’t do is doubt Si Woo’s liking for a Pete Dye design! It is these last three pointers that clinched it for me to roll the dice with Si Woo again this week and I am hoping he can add his name to the list of players who have memorably bounced back from heartbreak one week to win the next.
1427	1427	3	4	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@JazzrazDFS U forgot Paul Casey too
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
