4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
287	287	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
826	826	12	12	target: GAY 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			early unusually high-value prices: CANTLAY 120 🔥 HADWIN 150 🔥 STEELE 420 GAY 490 WEBB 500
5576	5576	10	10	target: Fowler’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite. A missed cut at the FedEx St Jude Classic aside – more on that shortly – Fowler might just have the most complete profile currently and is well capable of putting himself in position for victory once more. His latest opportunity to land himself a major came at the Masters in April and although perfectly poised after three rounds, it didn’t happen for the Californian as he drifted away to a T11 with a closing 76.
344	344	20	21	target: Cameron Smith 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Wesley should not be faded in any format as his floor and ceiling is very high. Fade of the Week  Cameron Smith  Many touts are talking about Cam Smith as a great first-time player play. He is a good wedge game player and makes a lot of birdies but I have a hard time playing a bad putter in this event.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
287	287	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
572	572	5	6	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Paul Casey - $9,500  3. Matt Kuchar - $8,200  4. Jimmy Walker - $7,900  5.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
11365	11365	37	37	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5 couldn’t get much going here last year when shooting 70-72-71-71 to finish T38 but expect a real improvement on that. Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
61	61	22	22	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s one of the biggest reasons we have what we have with DFS golf. I got him beating AT LEAST Snedeker, ZJ, Kuchar, Oost, and Jimmy Walker putting him at worst 13th. Pick to Click: Chappell totally screwed me.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
2122	2122	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
228	228	11	12	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			One To Swerve  Of the elite, I’m not really convinced that Henrik Stenson is playing well enough and his record in this event is modest. I’ll reveal my full line-up in Tuesday’s Playing The Tips feature. Does he have the calmness needed for this event?
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
190	190	18	18	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
516	516	1	1	target: Lunde 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
292	292	2	3	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Recommended Bet  Dustin Johnson to miss the cut at 9/2    *You can follow me on Twitter @SteveThePunter Especially given we haven't seen him since he missed the cut when defending at the US Open a month ago. DJ is a great links player and his Open record reads MC-12-2-9-32-12-49-9, so he's only ever missed the cut once before, and that was on debut, but he's been so disappointing of late that he has to be backed to miss the cut at a juicy 9/2.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
217	217	41	42	target: Justin Thomas. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The first of which most notably was a back to back winner this season, but more recently has only played three times in three months including an MDF and missed cut. If you haven’t guessed the name yet, I’m talking about Justin Thomas. Look for JT to have low ownership and the skill to win on any given week.
239	239	61	62	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members. It does not get any better than this anywhere in the industry.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
352	352	8	10	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.

2177	2177	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Derek Fathauer  3. Nick Watney  MY PICK : Jason Day ($10,000)  Jason Day is in a really interesting spot this week. He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world.
197	197	142	143	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone.

Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.

327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.

7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.

Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
108	108	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
273	273	15	15	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			1 has been a shadow of his 2016 self in 2017. It’s completely understandable, but Day recently missed the cut at the U.S. Open and the Travelers Championship and has yet to show that he can putt nearly as well as he did last season. • • •  Gerry Ahern  Projected champion: Justin Rose.
8801	8801	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.

1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.

Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season.

4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!

5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone.

3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
81	81	13	14	target: Luke Donald 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Negative : Si-Woo Kim ($6.4m) looks like 2016 has gone to his head. Luke Donald ($6.5m) doesn't do first appearances of the calendar year very well and Charlie Beljan at $6.7 million. Ask yourself 1) Why is he in the field?
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
384	384	27	28	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So when he gets that drive figured out again, look out!! Course history is something I will be looking at closely to break ties between players and Jason Day gets the check mark when I was deciding between him and DJ this week. In the last five years Day has four Top 15's, two Top 10's and a Top 5 finish here.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.

1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
188	188	50	51	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Texans have had a much better record at the Valero with locals taking the title the last two years (Hoffman and Walker)  Texas (Longhorns):  Beau Hossler, Cody Gribble, Jhonattan Vegas  Baylor (Bears):  Jimmy Walker, Ben Crane  Texas A&M (Aggies):  Ryan Palmer  Resides or raised in Texas: (not definitive)  KJ Choi, Patrick Reed, Shawn Stefani, Chad Campbell, Bob Estes, Brian Gay, Sean O’Hair, Ryan Palmer, Chris Stroud, Johnson Wagner  Texas Strokeplay Tournament form: (Shell Houston Open, Valero Texas Open, Byron Nelson, Colonial)  Brendan Steele  Adam Hadwin  Tony Finau  Martin Laird  Luke List  Keegan Bradley  D.A Points  Ryan Moore  Chris Kirk  Stewart Cink  ODDS:  2016: Charley Hoffman 30/1  2015: Jimmy Walker 25/1  2014: Steven Bowditch 350/  2013: Martin Laird 100/1  2012: Ben Curtis 150/1  After a three-year stretch of massive prices, things seemed to have settled into a more predictable zone. THIS YEAR:  20/1 Matt Kuchar 25/1 Charley Hoffman 28/1 Brendan Steele 28/1 Ryan Moore 28/1 Brooks Koepka 28/1 Branden Grace 30/1 Adam Hadwin 30/1 Jimmy Walker 33/1 Kevin Chappell 40/1 Tony Finau 40/1 Billy Horschel 40/1 Patrick Reed  THE FINAL CUT  Prices are DraftKings only. Walking The Plank  Matt Kuchar $11,500  Charley Hoffman $10,700  Zach Johnson $9,300  Patrick Reed $9,700  Kuchar looks mentally drained as he enters his sixth tournament in a row.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
107	107	35	35	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him. Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.

Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.

4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
278	278	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
12574	12574	32	32	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If that doesn’t scream consistency, I don’t know what does. All of this amazing recent form is gearing up for next week, obviously, but another final group this Sunday will not hinder Rose’s Masters preparation. He is firing on all cylinders right now and it would be foolish to fade him.
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Course: TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course  Yardage: 7,189  Par: 72  2016 champion: Jason Day      Tournament Preview    The list of recent winners at The Players Championship is impressive -- Woods, Mickelson, Day, Garcia, Fowler, Stenson, Scott. Add in the likes of Nicklaus, Norman, Couples, Duval, Price, Floyd and Trevino, and it's a remarkable array of champions over the 43-year history of golf's unofficial fifth major.
