3057	3057	1	2	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			5. Scott Brown - Brown, a former winner here, is the rare PR horse-for-course. Four top-15 finishes here the last five years.
11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
4675	4675	18	19	target: Fabrizio Zanotti 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			C List  Xander Schauffele $6,600  Smylie Kaufman $7,100 – Reverse the Curse. Robert Garrigus $7,100  Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano $7,200  Fabrizio Zanotti $6,900 – Euro guy who will be super low owned. GPP ONLY.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
13214	13214	12	12	target: Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below are the golfers who fit it this week. Casey  Kuchar  Harman  Cook  Glover  Landry  The top three aren’t a surprise, but the bottom three may test the trend! Cook, Glover, and especially Landry, don’t have the sharpest form coming into this week.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
5201	5201	12	12	target: Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
5084	5084	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose , Kevin Chappell & Ryan Moore – Keeping things pretty chalky in the B-List, with a troika of former champs and a player on the ascent. Kuch has made nine cuts in a row at The Memorial, highlighted by a win in 2013, six Top 10s, and no finish worse than T26. If the course was designed by Pete Dye or Jack Nicklaus, you always play Kuchar… Hideki missed the cut last season following a win and a T5 in his first two appearances.
8861	8861	7	7	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, you can't go wrong rostering him. Sergio Garcia @ $7,900  Sergio is so under-priced this week it will make him a very popular Draftkings pick but it also offers a high ceiling at a low price. He has only missed one cut this season and he is trending upwards in form.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
231	231	13	14	target: J Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Five for Pebble Beach: C Smith 125/1, S Cink 150/1, M Thompson 175/1, J Hahn 200/1, G Owen 200/1. 365 have nice top20 prices for latter four
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
12016	12016	21	22	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rose is playing a home game as he lives in nearby Lake Nona and has lots of success at Bay Hill. Tiger Woods has more, though, as he’s won the API eight times. If not for a third-round 78 here a year ago, Grillo might have won.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
1534	1534	7	7	target: DJ. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			My #1 Ranked Player this week is DJ. Did I do something wrong?
204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
13675	13675	10	11	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just look at the spotty track records of recent winners. Tiger Woods went 12 years in between his two wins here in which his best other finish was a solo eighth. Rickie Fowler has a win and a runner-up, but nothing better than a T-60 in six other starts.
6235	6235	6	6	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10200 – The world’s ninth-ranked player heads the field and represents a good value after a week of rest following his recent top-5 finish at the U.S. Open. Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
12699	12699	1	1	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm ($9300): Although he fell back in the pack on Sunday in his Masters debut last year, Rahm was very impressive through 54 holes at Augusta, sitting at even par through 54 in what was a very tough week for scoring. For a first-timer, Rahm flashed all the tools necessary to succeed in the years to come, and this year he should sport an even better finish. Since the start of 2018, the feisty Spaniard has amassed four top-25s – including a win at CareerBuilder and a runner-up in the Tournament of Champions – while missing zero cuts in seven events.
7240	7240	10	11	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance. Even if you doubt his ability to win, there's an awful lot of each-way juice in that price with eight each-way places.
5576	5576	10	10	target: Fowler’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite. A missed cut at the FedEx St Jude Classic aside – more on that shortly – Fowler might just have the most complete profile currently and is well capable of putting himself in position for victory once more. His latest opportunity to land himself a major came at the Masters in April and although perfectly poised after three rounds, it didn’t happen for the Californian as he drifted away to a T11 with a closing 76.
4788	4788	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All those sub-par rounds have translated into T10 on debut in 2010 and T12 last year. I always like Finau on a windy track and that's the deal this week. He won the Puerto Rico Open last year in really blustery conditions and fired a 65 in round two of the Texas Open when it blew over 20mph.
11370	11370	40	41	target: Tommy Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a plethora of players vying for a place in the six-man line-up for the official European Tour fantasy game and the addition of some top Americans, who are now eligible, adds to the difficulty for gamers. Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood will surely be a staple of most line-ups given their exploits here last year while Dutchman Joost Luiten could be a big-value outsider to cause a few waves. One To Swerve  Tyrrell Hatton’s T10 last year may have been based on the fact he was in fantastic form rather than loved the course.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
6500	6500	17	19	target: Tyrone Van Aswegen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			During his streak, he's up nearly six percentage points and slots a season-best T44 in the stat. Tyrone Van Aswegen … No golfer puts four rounds together regularly, but the absence of it entirely is the ironic constant among rank-and-filers. When expectations need to remain high to sustain a livelihood at this level, any spark can be monumental, not to mention lucrative.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
8444	8444	32	33	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
8931	8931	24	24	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That makes him a very nice rebound candidate this week. Others near the top of that list in top strokes gained in Asia include Scott Hend, David Lipsky, and Anirban Lahiri. Luke List… The Luke List Chalk Week didn’t crush anyone last week but it also didn’t live up to full expectations.
12242	12242	4	5	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Group 8 Jason Day  Louis Oosthuizen  Jason Dufner  James Hahn Only one player in this field has beaten Louis Oosthuizen in this event since 2013 - and he's drawn him in the group stage. Oosthuizen won all six games before losing the final to Jason Day in 2016, and won two of his three group games last year before coming up short in a play-off for a last-16 spot. All told, that's eight wins in 10 matches at the course and he also won three group games from three at Harding Park in 2015, eventually losing to Jim Furyk in the quarters having seen off Rickie Fowler in the last-16.
138	138	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8439	8439	27	27	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points; 16) Ian Poulter; 17) Webb Simpson; 18) Robert Garrigus / Zach Johnson / Jamie Lovemark. Winners & Prices (The Barclays) : 2016: Reed 50/1 ; 2015: Day 10/1 ; 2014: Mahan 50/1 ; 2013: Scott 16/1 ; 2012: Watney 70/1 ; 2011: D Johnson 35/1 ; 2010: Kuchar 40/1 . Average: 39/1.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
5223	5223	4	4	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brooks Koepka – $9,700  Brooks is making this list purely because of the fact that his ownership should be extremely low. I find it hard to imagine people will be building around Koepka at $9,700 with all of the other talent surrounding him. Most people will try and jam two of the top guys into their lineup with all of the value this week.
7688	7688	2	3	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also like: Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott and Paul Casey. Fowler checks all the boxes, while Scott is a past champion here. Also think Casey is playing way too well this year to not have a victory to show for it.
415	415	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
304	304	37	37	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open. When the disappointment fades, and it will quickly, Fowler should be thrilled to have been in contention again. We know he likes this track, having chased down Henrik Stenson to win here last year.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
10971	10971	51	51	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CLICK HERE TO TRY PGA, NBA, AND MORE! PGA DFS Players:  Top Tier: $11.9K – $9K  Dustin Johnson ($11.9K) – Dustin Johnson failed to close out the fierce Ted Potter Jr. on Sunday, but I doubt it will stop me (or anyone else) from playing a ton of him this week. DJ fits so well here.
10201	10201	28	28	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our ESPN and FantasyGolfInsider experts have laid out the players whom they believe have the skills to succeed and provide big fantasy point totals. Picks to win  Tony Finau  I've been telling anyone willing to listen that Finau is ready for a breakthrough season that could elevate him to top-10 player in the world status. On a long golf course like Torrey South, where he finished T-4 last year, he should thrive once again.
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
9596	9596	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
10428	10428	1	1	target: Matsuyama 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open. In four years he has a T4, T2 and back-to-back wins.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
2659	2659	17	18	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Olympic Course in Rio was brand new and nobody had played it. Justin Rose eeked out Henrik Stenson for gold and Matt Kuchar took home bronze. I could argue, quite easily in fact, that they were the three of best players in that field.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
139	139	0	0	target: Kirk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Kirk bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/RX3AFhpwDZ
3580	3580	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He ranks seventh on the tour in Strokes Gained: Putting and putts per round. His spot in a pool with Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia will help temper ownership despite his play. O'Hair has made the cut four out of six tries at August National and in seven of his past nine tour events.
1696	1696	46	47	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All kidding aside it is testament to this event that so many fans and players turn up here year-on-year given the clash in schedule. ADVERTISEMENT  Three of the last five winners have been straight out the top drawer with Hideki Matsuyama (2016), Brooks Koepka (2015) and Phil Mickelson (2013) winning in recent years. Whilst Koepka wasn’t a surprise winner, it was still his maiden win and as a result three of the last five winners have also been first-time PGA Tour winners.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
2820	2820	5	6	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Ranks T4 in par-3 scoring. Scott Brown … Didn't really threaten reaching paydirt at Riviera three weeks ago, but a share of second place (five strokes back) was a fine literal consolation. It's his only top-40 finish of the season, but he arrived at Copperhead having survived eight consecutive cuts and ranking 24th in strokes gained: putting.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
2563	2563	0	0	target: Jordan’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan’s 72.2 percent Recent GIR is 16th, and his 17.7 Recent Adj Bird Avg is tied for fourth among golfers who have made more than two starts the past six weeks. Spieth also played well at the WGC events last season, finishing T7, T17, T9, and T3. The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
10743	10743	20	20	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Day seems like the obvious play at the bottom of this range and the best overall value for the elites. Day will likely be popular this week for the reasons I just listed, so plan accordingly for GPP exposure. (Note: It is worth following how Day says his back is feeling prior to Thursday.)
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
414	414	6	6	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I guess after yesterday the Finau sucks in Florida narrative is dead? Is he LIVE at Bay Hill?
4103	4103	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A win in Fiji on the PGA Tour of Australasia two years ago slightly saves face, but there are obvious concerns at $11,500 and I am tempted to fade him this week. Brooks Koepka ($10,900) – Brooks Koepka at $10,900, are you crazy? Well maybe, but the signs suggest he is well on his way to being back and close to his best.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
568	568	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
7685	7685	23	24	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is the defending champion. Pinterest Chris Condon  Professor's Picks  Jordan Spieth  Jon Rahm  Dustin Johnson  Jason Day  Rory McIlroy  Hideki Matsuyama  Brooks Koepka  Rickie Fowler  Sergio Garcia  Bubba Watson  Professor's Explanation: Firestone is a big track. It is a "bombers and gorgers" kind of place.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
1129	1129	17	17	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The youngster admitted they didn't have their best stuff but it was still a strong performance. For Fowler, it follows on from T6 at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China a month ago. Adding to his credentials is his third place here at Albany 12 months ago where he shot 65-64 on the weekend.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
932	932	5	6	target: Jason Bohn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson Wagner - $8,400  4. Jason Bohn - $7,600  5. Charles Howell III - $7,500  6.
13668	13668	33	34	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
2122	2122	20	21	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Genesis Open closes the 2018 West Coast swing and sees a strong field arriving in Los Angeles. Defending champion Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas headline. With the Genesis Open now organised by TGR Live (Tiger Woods Foundation), it's also no surprise to see Tiger Woods in the field after an impressive Torrey Pines outing 2 weeks ago.
1904	1904	15	16	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament. We don't get him at a bargain $7.4m this week, but $8.6m will do instead.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
11932	11932	1	1	target: Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
7570	7570	18	18	target: Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
1028	1028	7	7	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
11453	11453	8	8	target: Sergio 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That’s generally the perfect combination for the Spaniard. Sergio Garcia  Sergio’s T33 at Honda last week was nothing special. However, there were some positive takeaways that should translate to Mexico.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
8444	8444	33	33	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/4 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Jason Day 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (6 places, 1/4 odds):  Jason Day fits the bill perfectly for me this week. Without a PGA Tour win since The Players Championship last season, Day is the perfect storm as he performs brilliantly up-state as well as in this event's previous guise as The Barclays, has improving recent form and at 49th in the FedEx Cup standings is an elite player who's well out of position.
5574	5574	59	59	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
4373	4373	16	16	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s long enough off the tee as well to take advantage of a little distance. While Laird can be a little boom or bust, but we like him in GPPs. Best bargain basement option  Alex Noren $6,600 – Noren is a total pricing anomaly this week.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
7110	7110	12	12	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m thinking the odds are in his favor. Sergio Garcia… Much like Fowler, he’s elite when it comes to playing in the elements. It’s no wonder he’s pieced together 10 top 10s in 20 Open Championship appearances.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
8940	8940	43	44	target: Gary Woodland; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pan; 12) Jim Herman; 13) Paul Casey; 14) Graeme DeLaet / Richy Werenski; 16) Hao Tong Li / Brendan Steele; 18) Jason Dufner / Lucas Glover; 20) Rafael Cabrera-Bello.

7416	7416	38	38	target: Ollie 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's rare to see a player such as him so high in the published Predictor Model and that clearly indicates that he's playing some great stuff and is suitable for the task ahead at Glen Abbey. RESULT: T62  Ollie Schniederjans 1pt EW 66/1 with Get a £20 free bet - get it here (6 places, 1/4 odds):  We were on board Ollie Schniederjans as recently as Old White TPC and despite a very strange WD there for a scoring card signing infringement, I'm still very much of the opinion that Ollie is a player to watch right now. His last performance at the John Deere Classic was far better as he co-led after shooting a flawless -8/63 on Thursday and backed that up with a -5/66 to get back in contention.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
6003	6003	1	2	target: David Lingmerth, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. David Lingmerth, $7,900  After a poor start to the season, Lingmerth has found the form that made the 29-year-old one of the game’s most interesting prospects in 2015-16. The Swede has four top-21 finishes in his last five events, smashing salary-based expectation each time.
2578	2578	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If this course plays as a less than driver placement course then I want a bunch of him on my teams. Sergio Garcia $8,500 – Don’t worry about that final round this past Sunday, as most everyone who went out late struggled. IF he can just putt then has as good of a chance as anyone, putting is a big IF for him though.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
11802	11802	53	54	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has had a number of top-10 finishes at this course over the years, and though he did miss the cut last year, what we've seen so far on his PGA Tour schedule has been very encouraging, with a 31st-place finish at Phoenix and a 26th-place finish at Pebble Beach. -- Zach Turcotte  Kevin Na  Nobody fits the Valspar Championship mold quite like Na. He's accurate off the tee, he is an elite wedge player, and he has a solid short game.
12644	12644	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
6424	6424	2	3	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: DQ  Bryson DeChambeau 0.75pt EW 90/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Bryson DeChambeau is a little like a box of chocolates, you just never know what you are going to get. However, this is the kind of low-key tournament where a talent like DeChambeau could fire, challenge and more than likely take the title. If we're looking for a motive, it appears that Bryson has noticed that he's outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and clearly he doesn't want to go through the stress of the web.com Playoffs again.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
2448	2448	12	12	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			How about one of the top five tee-to-green players in the world? Scott comes in about $3,300 cheaper this week than last week with all of the same tools needed to dominate an event like this one if his putter gets even reasonably warm. I love him at this price.
3679	3679	27	27	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
3826	3826	21	22	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, Joel and I recently cut him from our fantasy team, so you know he's going to play well. Just missed: Bryson DeChambeau and Russell Henley. Editor's note: Fantasy golf has arrived at FanDuel and Golf Digest has partnered with the daily fantasy sports site.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
13195	13195	0	1	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Austin Cook 100/1 (Winner) 0.5pt e/w:  Cook played in his first Masters last week, and struggled, missing the weekend due to rounds of 74-80 on Thursday and Friday. This doesn’t concern me though, as Augusta is not the sort of course that plays into Cook’s strengths, who moreover anything else, doesn’t hit it that far off the tee. Factor that in with the fact it was his debut on a course that rewards experience, and him missing the cut should be no surprise.
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
13639	13639	32	33	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			You can build your own model using the variables listed on the left hand side. Top 10 of my published predictor are Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Henrik Stenson, Zach Johnson, Webb Simpson, Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson. Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the WGC-Mexico Championship / Tshwane Open and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events.
10022	10022	13	14	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That would cut the field to the Top 60 and ties. Jon Rahm, Patrick Reed and Phil Mickelson headline a really good field this week. Some trends this week are first-time winners and players who have played at least one week in Hawaii.
2495	2495	38	38	target: Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In other words, right now he has the game to play well anywhere and that makes him such an appealing proposition on a course unknown to virtually everyone this week. Speaking about the current state of his game, Woodland said at the end of the Honda Classic: "I'm happy with the way I'm playing, and looking forward to playing the next couple weeks in a row." That's here and next week's PGA Tour event at Innisbrook.
13112	13112	40	41	target: Si Woo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time. The thing that makes these two finishes of particular interest to me is that when Si Woo has won his two PGA tour titles to date he hasn’t come in to the events on a blinding run of form, but has actually won events following steady 25th & 22nd place finishes. So in summary we have a world class proven winner, on a perfect track for his game rounding in to steady form.
3452	3452	16	17	target: Rickie Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Charl Schwartzel, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Rose, Louis Oosthuizen, Paul Casey, Bill Haas, Alex Noren, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm  – Kevin Kisner, Charl Schwartzel, Tommy Fleetwood, Bernd Wiesberger, Adam Hadwin, Thomas Pieters, Russell Henley, Sean O’Hair  Bets:  Rickie Fowler (28-1, now 20-1)  Paul Casey (45-1)  Louis Oosthuizen (66-1)  Alex Noren (100-1)  Bill Haas (125-1) Risky due to lack of experience but fully capable of a monster fantasy week. He’s a phenomenal ball striker whose improved putting and recent form gives him a shot at a high finish this week.
9594	9594	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Good record at Kapalua and obviously an elite talent, but not sure what his equipment situation is right now. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. Pretty easy call here, really.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
516	516	1	1	target: Lunde 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bill Lunde should be $6,400, but since DraftKings is being all formal and calling him "William" we have to pay $7,200.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
10093	10093	3	3	target: Kizzire’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The win is Kizzire’s second win of the young 2017-18 golf season and it boosted his standing in the World Golf Rankings. Less than three months ago, Kizzire was ranked outside of the Top 300; he is now number 54 in the world. The Sony Open took place in Hawaii where a ballistic missile alert was sent out mistakenly Saturday morning.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
169	169	14	14	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That eliminates a majority of the field from making a run at a win. Day gets motivated this time of year and his performance this summer has him simmering. There is no Ryder Cup for the Australian Day, so these next four tournaments are his swan song.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
2734	2734	12	13	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I'm dipping a little deeper in the betting market this week. Ryan Moore ticks plenty of boxes this week at a course where he tends to play well. At a test where scoring is likely to be difficult, an experienced level-head is no bad thing.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
3440	3440	27	28	target: Bill Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His combination of power, iron play, and poise should serve him very well regardless of the conditions, and you simply cannot beat the price tag this week. Bill Haas ($7,200) – Lost in the fray of big name, sexy picks will be boring Billy who could be the most patient golfer on the entire course this week. Regardless of the conditions – and he’s played every year since 2010 – Haas has carded nothing worse than a T42, and nothing worse than a T24 in the past four years.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
4959	4959	52	53	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Given the dry forecast, long-hitters won’t have as much of an advantage off the tee, and those with accuracy and precision figure to benefit from a little extra runout in the fairways. Past Champions    2016 - Jordan Spieth  2015 - Chris Kirk  2014 - Adam Scott  2013 - Boo Weekley  2012 - Zach Johnson  2011 - David Toms  2010 - Zach Johnson    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Jon Rahm - $18,400  Paul Casey - $16,700  Jason Dufner - $16,700  Matt Kuchar - $16,700    Cash-game Target: Having missed just one cut since May of 2016, Dufner has become one of the most reliable cash-game plays on Tour. Further aiding his case, he has made five consecutive cuts at Colonial while finishing runner-up twice.
5325	5325	8	9	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His personal best was a T13 in 2014. Roberto Castro … While he's been optimistic to point out that his form can be directly proportional to the time of year – that is, when it heats up nationwide, so does he – and while that's precisely what's occurred a couple of times since he splashed onto the PGA TOUR in 2012, he's still searching for a flint to spark this year's surge. As he creeps up on his 32nd birthday (on June 23), he's survived only one cut in his last nine starts.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
6813	6813	24	25	target: Roberto Castro 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Morgan Hoffmann  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Kevin Kisner, Kevin Na, Danny Lee, Ben Martin, Chad Campbell, Robert Garrigus, Wes Bryan, Roberto Castro  – Kevin Streelman, Jonathan Randolph, Bud Cauley, Morgan Hoffmann, Curtis Luck  Bets:  Kevin Na 40-1 EW  Bud Cauley 45-1  Roberto Castro 175-1 EW He is 2/2 in cuts made at the John Deere as well, and at near min-price he’s a great gpp target. Castro is supremely talented and on a course where length isn’t a factor he could easily keep his good vibes rolling from the Greenbrier here.
3597	3597	30	31	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Below I have included a list of the guys that have the highest numbers of eagles per hole in their PGA tournaments so far, this year. Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas, Angel Cabrera, Danny Willett, Jon Rahm, Phil Mickelson, and Charley Hoffman. Thanks a lot for reading!
7388	7388	21	21	target: Kuchar: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s truly sensational, and as long as he keeps the mental game together, you need to consider him every week. Matt Kuchar: I may not have wanted him to do well for DFS purposes, but man did I want him to win just so he could finally get a major. Regardless, while Kuch did play pretty damn well, his putting was utterly ridiculous as this was by far the best performance Kuchar has ever put up at a British with an utterly absurd 19 birdies.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
3239	3239	48	48	target: Peterson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Total Points staked this week: 3  Profit/Loss for 2017: – 36  I have purposely kept stakes to a minimum this week, as I didn’t want to get too involved in this event. Horschel was too obvious to ignore, whilst I have been looking for a chance to back Peterson, and Texas is as arguably the best place to get him on side. Ross Fisher looked like giving us a run for our money last week, only to be knocked out by Hideto Tanihara in the quarter finals.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
1261	1261	12	12	target: Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			LETS DO THIS!!!!! NORTH COURSE STACK!!!!! Spaun +8000 Cink +10000 Chesson +10000 Wise +12500 Mullinax +15000 Post… https://t.co/3EHQym9alE
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
6269	6269	18	19	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At this price, Cauley would be one of the first players I use in cash games this week. Graham DeLaet ($7,500) – DeLaet teased us again last week at the Travelers, before fading a bit on Saturday. He’s mentioned numerous times that TPC River Highlands is his favorite course on Tour, so it’s no surprise to see him play well.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
5841	5841	15	16	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Surprisingly, he only has one top 10 in the last five years in this event. Adam Scott – Played the weekend in his last five including finishes of T-9, T-4 and T-18 last year at Oakmont. There aren’t many better in the GIR department, and that’s why the Aussie continues to collect big checks most weeks he tees it up.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
10660	10660	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form, course form and motivation could be converging nicely. RESULT: T35  Matt Kuchar 1.25pts EW 40/1 with Get a £30 risk-free bet for new customers, 18+, T&Cs apply (6 places EW, 1/5):  I also like Matt Kuchar this week on a course where he's finished 6th across both the National Pro-Am and the 2010 U.S. Open. Yes he doesn't win enough, but a 40/1 shot this week has a little juice within it and as Gary Woodland proved last week, short-term momentum can sometimes get these kind of players over the line.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
8709	8709	47	47	target: Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The T5 came in the US Open, the T20 in the Open Championship, the T13 in the WGC-Bridgestone and the T17 in The Northern Trust. Any ideas that his top five in the US Open was a one-week-only tale of little guy did good is simply wrong; Schauffele keeps going up against the world's best and performing with credit. His excellent effort at Erin Hills in the year's second major was the turning point though.
7116	7116	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, if they start to swirl the low ball flight/long iron specialist will grind out enough pars to be in contention. Brandt Snedeker , Matt Kuchar, Francesco Molinari, Jordan Spieth & Paul Casey – Since suffering a wrist injury early this year, the world seems to have completely forgotten about Snedeker. Always one of the world’s best wind players, the 36-year-old has rebounded nicely with T14/T9 finishes since his return to health.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
13249	13249	29	29	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Johnson is one of the most talented souls on tour; just not sure that translates to dividends this week. We do like Riccio's picks of Paul Casey and Zach Johnson, two players whose games mirror past RBC Heritage winners like Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, and Graeme McDowell. Same goes for his picks of Austin Cook (although the Model seemingly chooses Cook every week) and Matt Kuchar (who's won here in the past).
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
2908	2908	14	15	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Greens in Regulation : 1) Adam Scott; 2) Bubba Watson; 3) Alex Noren; 4) Tyrrell Hatton; 5) Tommy Fleetwood; 6) Russell Knox / Scott Piercy; 8) Charles Howell III; 9) Keegan Bradley; 10) Sam Burns; 11) Kevin Streelman / Peter Uihlein; 13) Justin Rose; 14) Jason Kokrak; 15) Billy Horschel; 16) Kevin Chappell; 17) Emiliano Grillo / Shane Lowry; 19) James Hahn / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Jason Day; 2) Hideki Matsuyama; 3) James Hahn; 4) Tommy Fleetwood; 5) Tiger Woods; 6) Cameron Smith; 7) Emiliano Grillo / Patton Kizzire / Alex Noren; 10) Chesson Hadley; 11) Marc Leishman; 12) Charl Schwartzel; 13) Brian Harman / Si Woo Kim; 15) Austin Cook / Justin Rose / Sam Saunders; 18) Tyrrell Hatton; 19) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Zach Johnson / Ollie Schniederjans / Chris Stroud. Winners & Prices : 2017: Leishman 100/1 ; 2016: Day 14/1 ; 2015: Every 300/1 ; 2014: Every 66/1 ; 2013: Woods 3/1 ; 2012: Woods 8/1 ; 2011: Laird 45/1 ; 2010: Els 16/ 1; Average: 69/1.
13319	13319	54	56	target: Si Woo Kim, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Obviously I say this with my tongue firmly in my cheek as my reasons for siding with Beau again this week go way beyond any kind of misguided loyalty. No, my main reason for backing Beau again this week is how hugely impressive I felt he was down the stretch in Houston and, unlike Si Woo Kim, until a couple of loose shots in the play off you could lay no fault at Beau’s door for him not taking the trophy home that week. Had this performance come out of the blue I would perhaps have been a bit more cautious but of course Hossler has been talked about as a potentially huge star of the game in the making for a long while now and he has been producing some good stuff on the tour all season without putting four rounds together until it all clicked in Houston.
11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
4408	4408	24	25	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Probably not. But he definitely should be in contention through Sunday… You could swerve on to Ryan Moore here, or eat the chalk with Matt Kuchar, but I’ll be rolling with Walker. A gamble?
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
2188	2188	28	29	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His good friend Justin Thomas has won PGA Tour events in back-to-back weeks this year, why not believe Spieth will join the party? Also like: Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott. The Spaniard won in his last start in Dubai and absolutely loves Riviera, or so his record shows.
352	352	8	10	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?
5574	5574	59	59	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
5892	5892	9	10	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Freddie Jacobson: 14th US Open/32nd St Jude/27th TPC4S/31st Colonial. Bubba Watson: 33rd Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass/43rd TPC Louisiana/14th Houston. First Round Leader Analysis : First round leader(s), their group and winning score since 2010.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
11165	11165	14	15	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's why scrambling is so important this week. last year, Rickie Fowler and co-runners-up Gary Woodland and Morgan Hoffmann all finished top-10 in scrambling. The year before, the top-8 finishers were all top-12 in scrambling.
7740	7740	32	33	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Stan James have gone 6 places each way at 1/5 odds plus bet £10 get £20 free for new customers - for full details click here . My selections are as follows:  Brooks Koepka 2pts EW 20/1 with Bet £/€5 get £/€20 (5 places EW, 1/4 odds):  Jordan Spieth arrives at another strict ball-striking test as the bookies favourite this week and after riding his luck and putting incredibly well at the end to win The Open Championship a fortnight ago at Royal Birkdale, whether he can repeat that feat here remains to be seen. Firestone South isn't the best fit to Spieth's game, however the same could be said of the Southport links and we all saw what happened there.
16	16	15	16	target: Harold Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – It’s not often PGA Tour players get back-to-back home games. Harold Varner III isn’t complaining. Last week, Varner teed it up at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C., near Gastonia, where Varner grew up and attended Forestview High.
3765	3765	38	38	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He should be more mentally ready than many of the players in the field who went four rounds last week and I’d look for him to get on track here with a big finish. Others: Jason Dufner  Values  Billy Horschel ($7,600): I admittedly am not sure what to expect from Horschel here but at well under 8k in a weaker field I think he’s worth rostering. Horschel has been bad around the greens this year but is also hitting greens at a high rate which should help him given Harbour Town’s small targets.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!

1522	1522	0	0	target: CHOI 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			CHOI has an impeccable record at Riviera. https://t.co/iNGBsDFpIs
9945	9945	52	52	target: Stuard’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This good run of form so far this season has seemingly come out of nowhere as he signed off 2017 with seven-straight missed cuts, starting at the U.S. Open. There is a risk, like there is with any player that the bubble may burst after a good run, but I think in Stuard’s case, that run may extend just one more week. His form at this course reads MC-MC-5-10-57, so a real mixture of form.
13621	13621	64	65	target: Tommy Fleetwood; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accuracy : 1) Ryan Moore; 2) John Senden; 3) Emiliano Grillo / Kyle Stanley; 5) Keegan Bradley; 6) Chris Stroud; 7) Daniel Berger; 8) Ryan Blaum; 9) Adam Hadwin / Brian Harman; 11) Alex Cejka / Tommy Fleetwood; 13) Jonathan Randolph; 14) Andrew Landry; 15) Kevin Kisner; 16) Vaughn Taylor; 17) Fabian Gomez / Alex Noren / Ted Potter Jnr / Webb Simpson / Kevin Streelman.

13525	13525	8	9	target: Abraham Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List). His form is outstanding and he’s gaining a lot of his strokes with impeccable ball striking from tee to green.
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.
82	82	6	7	target: Gary Woodland 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark horse to win this week: Gary Woodland
327	327	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#WGCMexico Picks Stenson +1500 Scott +2500 Rahm +3000 Woodland +5000 Reed +5000 Rafa +8000 --- 🍔 +8000
327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
1479	1479	8	8	target: Keegan 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Every week is both always and never a Keegan week. https://t.co/d9PvoDStVh
720	720	17	17	target: Kim. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Better than feeling bad... All the An and Kang this week with a sprinkle of Lee and Kim. #TeamKorea https://t.co/TCc8MHOJgR
7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
10777	10777	3	3	target: Griffin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt e/w Lanto Griffin at 400/1 Coral (7 places; 1/5 odds) There have been surprise winners of this event before, so why not Griffin. This is obviously a massive step-up in class but his win last year at the Nashville Open kicked off a run of good form and two weeks ago he impressed with a T12 at the Farmers Insurance Open.
108	108	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
8801	8801	44	44	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up. It's only a two-point difference - 12/1 without Spieth compared to 14/1 with - so, as I'm so keen on the favourite, this looks a great to get a full payout on Rose being best of the rest.
10361	10361	23	24	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Zach Johnson  A little further down the board, we have ZJ who has fallen victim to slow starts to the season over the last few years. That hasn't been a problem so far as he's 5-for-5 to kickoff the 2017-18 season, with all of them doubling as top 25s.
608	608	2	2	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
1903	1903	28	29	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's usually his strength, so it's a watching brief for me this week. Fantasy Points Per Game :  Rank 1: Jordan Spieth ($12.0m); 2: Kevin Kisner ($7.4m): 3: Matt Kuchar ($8.6m); 4: Webb Simpson ($8.6m); 5: Jon Rahm ($9.6m); 6: Adam Hadwin ($7.3m); 7: Dustin Johnson ($11.8m); 8: Sean O'Hair ($7.3m); 9: Greg Owen ($7.4m); 10: Phil Mickelson ($9.3m). Positives : Matt Kuchar will be a steady hand this week which will be perfect for the conditions and the tournament.
5864	5864	29	29	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is his tournament debut but for those who like to take the course designer angle, TPC River Highlands is a Pete Dye track, as was Whistling Straits where Lahiri shone in the PGA. Lahiri didn't play in the US Open but neither did two of those above six post-majors winners. Three of the other four missed the cut so five of the last six players to win straight after a major hadn't played all four rounds the week before.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
665	665	0	0	target: Billy 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Billy Ho a name to watch this week at Valero: past 4 years: 4, 3, MC, 3. After MC this season: 2, 4, 13.
11138	11138	4	4	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In four starts here, Scott has a win, two top-14 finishes and just one MC (on debut in 2011) so it fair to say he should be comfortable with the layout. Scott ranked 3rd for Greens in Regulation last week at Riviera, but of course did not hole the amount of putts he needs to, to go low or in fact break par. He shots rounds of 72-72-71-71 and ranked 75th out of 76 qualifying players in Strokes-Gained: Putting, which is no surprise given he ranks 203rd in that area on Tour this season.
4077	4077	12	12	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure List make your list among value plays this week. JJ Spaun $7,800 – Spaun is a Web.com graduate, making a huge impact on the PGA Tour in his first season. He gains strokes off the tee and makes a ton of birdies.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
4621	4621	34	34	target: Shelton, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As we saw last week with Kim, and as we've seen all year with Rahm, age is no barrier to success anymore - regardless of the event. And while patience may be required with Shelton, when he's playing such obviously good golf, backing him at this sort of price doesn't need too much in the way of considered thought. All 3 tips to finish in top 20 - 50/1!
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
2906	2906	92	93	target: Tyrrell Hatton; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Recent Player Skill Rankings : These rankings are based on a 10-tournament window that stretches back to the Sentry Tournament of Champions and includes both PGA Tour and European Tour events. Players must have played in a minimum of 2 Tour events to be included and rankings are based on performance relative to the rest of the field:  Driving Accurac y: 1) Tommy Fleetwood; 2) Ryan Armour / Kevin Kisner / Kyle Stanley; 5) Vaughn Taylor; 6) Emiliano Grillo; 7) Matthew Fitzpatrick / Ryan Moore / Alex Noren; 10) Henrik Stenson; 11) Tyrrell Hatton; 12) Keegan Bradley / Kevin Streelman; 14) Kevin Chappell; 15) Brandt Snedeker; 16) Rickie Fowler / Zach Johnson; 18) Austin Cook / Brian Harman / Billy Horschel.

8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
1066	1066	19	19	target: Every 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk 125/1 e/w. Dumped the PXG clubs and showed glimpses of form in the wrap around. Will back Every FRL just… https://t.co/nlXK2RBxtK
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
4758	4758	11	11	target: Brooks 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Brooks Koepka: Koepka lost in a playoff to Garcia at this event last year. Importantly, Brooks has found his form: His 67.1 Recent Adj Rd Score ranks second overall this week, and his 18.0 Recent Adj Bird Avg is third.
11182	11182	26	27	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It won’t surprise me one bit to see Martin use his world-class tee two green game to propel himself to a top 20 finish this week. Louis Oosthuizen ($7.9K) – In this outing, the South African makes his season debut and looks for his elusive first win stateside. Louis Oosthuizen played well here last year.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
13668	13668	33	34	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The ability to play well at Hilton Head often transfers itself very well to the Stadium Course which cannot be overpowered and DeChambeau clearly can play tournament golf on stretching courses. RESULT: T37  Kevin Kisner 1pt EW 66/1 with New customers: Bet £10 get £30 plus 30 free spins - 18+, T&Cs apply** - 7 EW, 1/5 odds. Kevin Kisner seems the sort who now raises himself for the very biggest tournaments and we know he's a Pete Dye course specialist.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
129	129	18	19	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4th at Chambers Bay last year and 5th at Oakmont this year tell you as much. RESULT: MC  Jimmy Walker 0.75pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  A value price for Jimmy Walker who bookmakers clearly think will rest on his first Major Championship laurels. I'm not so sure though as Walker has a huge amount of positives going into this week.
514	514	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I will be spending 55 minutes of our 1 hr podcast telling @KendoVT how much I love Finau this week https://t.co/726ehHw8QO
7570	7570	17	18	target: Ben Martin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With the balanced lineup construction approach we’re taking in GPP’s this week, Cantlay will be a staple. Ben Martin $8,200 – Martin fits a very similar profile in terms of ability as Patrick Cantlay. He’s a tremendous scorer when he gets hot with the putter and takes advantage of par 5’s.
8996	8996	1	1	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – GPP – DK: $12300 FD: $10500  Despite the high price tag it is incredibly hard to go against Thomas this week. Not only is Thomas coming in with incredible form (two wins, and four of last five finishes inside of the top six) he has also won here in Malaysia the past two years. Thomas checks all of the boxes we are looking for this week and has shown his ability to run away from the field here at The CIMB Classic.
5612	5612	28	28	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Normally, golfers have to overcome a frustration with self or Mother Nature or an innate anger at the USGA for laying down such a punishing eight-mile walk. For Johnson, it has never appeared that this is the case. He handled his penalty during the final round of the event last year the same way one would handle hearing their order is ready at a Starbucks.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
5816	5816	23	23	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			With very mixed reports about the layout, ultimately people will guess as to how exactly Erin Hills will play. The great thing about Rose is that he is just as home on a bomber’s layout as he is a fiddly, narrow course like Merion where he won in 2013. The only negative for me is that he has been suffering from a slight back injury but having missed Memorial to rest up I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is fully fit for Erin Hills.
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
1716	1716	10	10	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Some early observations from the @DraftKings prices for the WGC-Mexico: DJ and Thomas are far and away the top two,… https://t.co/3vuhD74OJh
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
8330	8330	11	12	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’ll play him confidently in GPP or cash games. Value Plays:  Scott Brown $8,200 – “Brownie” really impressed last week at The PGA with a T13 considering the 7,600-yard Quail Hollow Club was not built for his style of play. Sedgefield Country Club, the site of the Wyndham, is built for Scott’s game as he’s a great ball striker, accurate off the tee, and scores in bunches when he’s in the zone.
5720	5720	18	19	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Grace is playing well at the moment and has the game to be a big danger man here. Kevin Kisner 55/1  Kisner has been in fine fettle this season showing some great consistency. His good run of form began back in January where he finished T4 at the windy Waialae Country Club, home of the Sony Open.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
2153	2153	40	40	target: Dustin 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Riviera hasn’t been a place where players suddenly “find their games” and as the sort main event of the West Coast swing, emphasizing players who have performed well at the previous few events is not a bad idea. Stud Picks  Dustin Johnson ($11,400): Hard to argue with Dustin at all this week. Some point to Pebble Beach as his favorite course but this venue might actually suit him better.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
3310	3310	28	29	target: Jason Dufner: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He has top 20 upside this here this week and is a really nice value at only $7,300, that can be used in both cash games and GPPs. Jason Dufner: (7,100) Dufner is another player who is just way too cheap for how consistent he has been this season. The 70th ranked player in the world has been great, only missing one cut this season, and finishing no worse than T25 in all of the events he has made the cut.
9691	9691	11	12	target: Xander Schauffele 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			His course history isn’t great, but I will consider for cash. Xander Schauffele $8,600 – His recent stats aren’t that great so he won’t be high on most people’s models. Mix that with his missed cut here last year and you could get him at low ownership.
3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
5625	5625	27	28	target: Adam Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play. Also like Casey, Adam Scott has found some success on the comparison courses: T4 at Chambers Bay, a T9 and T39 at Whistling Straits, and T16 at Royal Birkdale.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
10352	10352	13	14	target: James Hahn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also calls Scottsdale home, so you can't complain about a little local knowledge. James Hahn  Another golfer with ties to the area. Back in 2016, Hahn said he's played this course a hundred times.
303	303	3	3	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The winner: Rickie Fowler  If there is a player with the temperament to quickly recover from blowing a big PGA Tour win then it is Rickie Fowler. It looked like he was going to trade blows down the stretch with Patrick Reed until a huge wobble – bogey at 15, double at 16 and bogey at 18 – dropped him into a tie for 7th  Maybe I am a glass half full kind of guy but I saw lots to be positive about in Fowler’s play ahead of his defence of the Deutsche Bank at TPC Boston this week. This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.

2315	2315	31	32	target: (Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As a result, international players have reigned supreme at PGA National since the Honda Classic made it the host course in 2007. In 10 events, a non-American has won seven times (Adam Scott, Padraig Harrington, Rory McIlroy, Rory Sabbatini, Camilo Villegas, YE Yang & Ernie Els). And when Team Uncle Sam decides to vault into the winner’s circle, it’s not exactly the who’s who of the sport: Russell Henley (2014), Michael Thompson (2013) & Mark Wilson (2007).
172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
10573	10573	12	13	target: Zach Johnson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			High potential reward, low risk with both these guys. Webb Simpson and Zach Johnson. Webber is a total course horse with zero finishes outside the top 15 in five starts here since 2011.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1010	1010	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk - $11,300  2. Charles Howell III - $9,200  3. Cody Gribble - $8,400  4.
3497	3497	23	23	target: Thomas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Knox, a businessman is a fine player, holding the course record (61) from the Members tees, at Augusta. Knox’ experience is invaluable and Thomas has again enlisted his help, ahead of his second Masters start. Jimmy Johnson, Thomas’ caddie also believes the now 4-time PGA Tour winner is in much better shape this time around.

4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
2794	2794	30	31	target: Graham DeLaet, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Other: Chris Kirk (four wins to his credit and decent form, gives him plenty of upside), Bud Cauley  Players to Consider (in no order)  – Henrik Stenson, Charles Howell III, Graham DeLaet, Kevin Na, Billy Horschel, Jason Dufner, Russell Henley, Ollie Scienderjans, Charley Hoffman, Luke Donald  – Byeong Hun An, Robert Garrigus, Chris Kirk, Nick Watney, Cameron Tringale, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith, Chris Kirk, Bud Cauley At some point he will get on track and merits some consideration for gpps at the bare minimum price this week. DeChambeau has also played Copperhead as an amateur and had success here in the past.
3084	3084	12	13	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Peter Uihlein $10,100 – Mostly plays Euro Tour and absolutely bombs it. Graham DeLaet $10,600 – Solid course history and form. I’d play in all formats.
13524	13524	40	40	target: Ancer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a boom or bust play as demonstrated by three top 15’s and three missed cuts in his last six events, but that’s what you’re looking for in this price range. Best bargain basement option:  Embed from Getty Images  Abraham Ancer $6,900 – Ancer is the lowest priced guy we feel comfortable with given the weak field and pricing structure. In the last six weeks, there’s only one player in the field that’s gained more strokes total than Ancer (List).
278	278	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
