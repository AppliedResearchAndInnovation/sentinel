4135	4135	17	17	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is an elite ball striker and his hitting a ton of greens in regulation this season. Finau has been known to struggle on Bermuda greens, but this course has allowed bad putters to win in the past. Finau will very popular this week, so if you want to reap the rewards of a high Finau finish, you will need to roster him in over 30% of your lineups.
11207	11207	35	35	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He popped with a T-11 at this event last season, so the upside is absolutely here at this price. While I’m not going to be dipping down into the sub-$7,000 range too much this week, Lahiri is one of the few guys in this group who is in both cash game and GPP consideration. Wesley Bryan - $6,800  Bryan has been horrendous off the tee this season, and I’m hoping that a trip to a course that allows him to club down will help him regain some form.
12019	12019	30	31	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
12392	12392	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
2102	2102	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
5084	5084	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar, Justin Rose , Kevin Chappell & Ryan Moore – Keeping things pretty chalky in the B-List, with a troika of former champs and a player on the ascent. Kuch has made nine cuts in a row at The Memorial, highlighted by a win in 2013, six Top 10s, and no finish worse than T26. If the course was designed by Pete Dye or Jack Nicklaus, you always play Kuchar… Hideki missed the cut last season following a win and a T5 in his first two appearances.
69	69	36	37	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The field for this tournament is usually stacked and this year proves to be no different as players begin to start getting into form for the year. Expect even more eyeballs on this year's event as Tiger Woods has officially put his name into the field, love him or hate him he still makes every tourney he plays a must see event. Before we get into our sleeper picks for the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open make sure and check out our featured Fantasy Golf contest for this years event:
1923	1923	25	26	target: Dustin Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Pricing this week on DK is closer to usual, but they did throw some curve balls so let’s find a winner and high finishers. A-List  Dustin Johnson $11,800 – His course history is very good. I’m not sure what happened to him at the Farmers except maybe playing with Tiger and slow Jason Day might have worn him down.
250	250	28	29	target: Jordan Spieth's 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has a decent bank of Open Championship form and I fancy he'll get hold of the Claret Jug one day but it might not be this year. Jordan Spieth's form figures are decent. Since finishing tied second to Kevin Kisner at the Dean & Deluca Invitational, he's finished 13th at the Memorial Tournament, 35th at the US Open and first at the Travellers Championship but that victory was almost a month ago now and he's another that's decided to have time off rather than play and that's very off-putting given recent trends.
7254	7254	51	51	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
9801	9801	19	20	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Points and Jonas Blixt decided they just couldn’t shed the lei. Additionally, notables Jimmy Walker, Tony Finau, Webb Simpson, Zach Johnson, Gary Woodland, Bill Haas, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley, Gary Woodland, Emiliano Grillo and Peter Uihlein also will join the fray. Add in a cadre of top-100-ranked Japanese Tour players — Yusaku Miyazato (50), Satoshi Kodaira (51), and Shugo Imahira (84) — and this is a much deeper field than you’d expected at the second event of the calendar year.
8878	8878	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Statistically, Finau is dominating off of the tee recently, a quick glance at our VIP Research Station shows he is right at the top of the field in this regard. On a course with plenty of scoring opportunities, I like Finau’s chances this week. Keegan Bradley – Cash – DK: $9300  Bradley made ten straight cuts to finish the season.
287	287	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
2178	2178	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s seen a $1,600 price drop and is only the fifth most expensive golfer, despite finishing T5 last week and still being the number one golfer in the world. Day doesn’t have the strongest history here (two MCs and a 64th), but the last time he played this event was way back in 2012 and given the layoff I wouldn’t put too much stock in his shaky course history. While he hasn’t shown dominant form yet in 2017, Day put in three great rounds at Pebble and this could easily be the week he puts the hammer down and distances himself from the field.
685	685	9	10	target: Graham DeLaet 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is also safe in all formats this week. Graham DeLaet  Vegas Odds - 100/1  Draftkings - $7,200  FantasyAces - $5,000  After tremendous 2013 & 2014 seasons where DeLaet recorded seven Top 10 finishes in each he has now gone back to back season with just three in each. The Weyburn , Saskatchewan native will look to rebound and it starts this week with the Safeway open.
1	1	23	24	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s missed only one cut, so this dismissal is relative, but he’s finished no better than T14, and that was eight years ago. Kevin Na … Since a solo third here in 2011, he’s 2-for-4 with no top 60s and no red numbers in 12 rounds. Charles Howell III … I almost always reference course history buffs with a not-so-subtle jab at their narrow-mindedness, but they have it right this time.
2862	2862	18	19	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If you want to go contrarian, Graeme McDowell is the guy in this group. Hideki Matsyuama, Justin Rose, Paul Casey, & Kevin Kisner – Don’t worry about Hideki’s recent struggles, his ball striking and short game are still elite, which is necessary at Bay Hill… Rose has four Top 15s in his last five trips to Orlando along with three Top 5 finishes in his past five overall. As a bonus, he’s second in the field from the key Par 3 Range, trailing only Martin Kaymer… Casey has just been playing too well to not pop at some point.
204	204	0	1	target: Louis Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Louis Oosthuizen - ranked #29 on the Planet Earth... 64 golfers priced higher this week.
6235	6235	6	6	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10200 – The world’s ninth-ranked player heads the field and represents a good value after a week of rest following his recent top-5 finish at the U.S. Open. Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form.
133	133	21	21	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has average course history here since his win, making five straight cuts but no finish was inside the top 30. Laird has two top 10 finishes in his last five, but also has three finishes outside of the top 60. He is priced in what looks like to be a dead range, so I will be taking my $500 in savings and going elsewhere.
7240	7240	10	11	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There is one player who fits the bill perfectly, 39-year-old Matt Kuchar. I've never had any interest in backing Kuchar in tournaments when he's one of the favourites at around 14/1 and 16/1 but here he's a rather underappreciated 55/1 chance. Even if you doubt his ability to win, there's an awful lot of each-way juice in that price with eight each-way places.
5576	5576	10	10	target: Fowler’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite. A missed cut at the FedEx St Jude Classic aside – more on that shortly – Fowler might just have the most complete profile currently and is well capable of putting himself in position for victory once more. His latest opportunity to land himself a major came at the Masters in April and although perfectly poised after three rounds, it didn’t happen for the Californian as he drifted away to a T11 with a closing 76.
7928	7928	43	43	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie enters the week as the 11th-ranked golfer in the world and is coming off three solid weeks – Bridgestone is still pending so it’s excluded – with finishes of T22, T3, and T5 before his last missed cut at the St. Jude. Fowler also finished T11 at Augusta, and although he’s yet to win a major his track record with high finishes in majors combined with his track record at Quail Hollow are positive signs. In the last six years at this course, the diminutive candidate for BPTNWAM has won (2012), made the cut with mediocre finishes twice, and finished T4 last year.
4788	4788	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			All those sub-par rounds have translated into T10 on debut in 2010 and T12 last year. I always like Finau on a windy track and that's the deal this week. He won the Puerto Rico Open last year in really blustery conditions and fired a 65 in round two of the Texas Open when it blew over 20mph.
1137	1137	17	17	target: Snedeker 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At HAMMER DFS we have done it many times before. Here is a tidbit for you:  Wow… Snedeker is only 6400. With less than 20 golfers and no cut you will need to find lots of birdies.
105	105	24	24	target: Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			His long, arrant style off of the tee and lack of scrambling skills will put him in a ton of tricky spots this week. Walker isn’t in the best of form either. He has three starts in a row finishing outside the top 50 including two missed cuts.
7254	7254	1	1	target: Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dustin Johnson is another player searching for his form, although Johnson at least was dominating earlier this year before a tumble down the stairs prior to The Masters sidetracked his season. Like McIlroy, Johnson’s also coming into Royal Birkdale trending in the wrong direction with two missed cuts. However, since 2010, DJ’s recorded 11 rounds in the 60’s at The Open, clearly indicating he loves playing The Open rota.
4962	4962	8	9	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That's this course for Duff. -- Michael Collins  Zach Johnson  The two-time major winner is having a so-so year, but he always seems to excel at Colonial, where he's won the tournament twice and has never missed the cut. He has four top-20 finishes this season.
11964	11964	40	41	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 66/1 you are getting an in-form player who has finished 11th or better four times here since 2009, including twice in the top-9 in the last three years. Kevin Chappell 75/1 (Bet365) 1pt e/w:  In very similar fashion to Zach Johnson, Kevin Chappell has been solid all season long, missing just one cut, and finishing inside the top-31 in his other eight starts. Of course his 15th and 21st place finishes in limited fields at the Hero World Challenge and Tournament of Champions respectively are nothing to shout about, but there have been some highlights.
224	224	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Ritter: Well, Mike Davis said last month he had no plan to push it beyond 8,000 yards, even though he could. So, maybe Scott wins this round. He might win the Open, too.
9859	9859	31	32	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			That suggests he's a better bet for the other West Coast events at Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach where he produced a win and a T5 in 2017. Next Best: Back Austin Cook e.w. @ 60/1  It took 20-under to win last year's CareerBuilder Challenge, while 25-under triumphed in 2016 and 22-under in 2015.
155	155	20	21	target: Adam Scott, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He ranks third in SG: Putting this year. He's likely to be less owned than former champs Danny Willett and Adam Scott, as well as world No. 2, Rory McIlroy, who top the group.
12647	12647	14	15	target: Brandt Snedeker: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If the GOLF GODS exist, they’ll be worth a couple of shots this week. Brandt Snedeker: He’s never made the cut but his last trip was 2013. He was one shot out of the lead at Valspar before fading with 78.
2529	2529	33	33	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time. The last four cuts Fleetwood has made, he’s led the field in ball-striking each time, and since last summer he’s had his ball on a string. In that department, he is world-class and make no mistake.
8017	8017	1	1	target: Fowler… 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler… Quail Hollow is also the site of his first TOUR win. Fowler has since won at TPC Sawgrass, one of the ball-striking courses I’m using as a correlated track. Another things going for Pretty Rickie is his season-long form.
287	287	18	18	target: Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I know I'm not really where I want to be in my game and maybe nothing else, either, Stenson said, "but I'll try to enjoy." Stenson hasn't won a title since shooting a final-round 63 at Royal Troon to win his first major. He said his ball-striking hasn't been good for the last 18 months, apart from during a two-month stretch in the summer of 2016 when he won the BMW International Open in Germany followed by the Open Championship three weeks later.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
12285	12285	101	102	target: Harris English. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi; 9) Fabian Gomez; 10) Richy Werenski; 11) Brice Garnett / Graeme McDowell / Rory Sabbatini; 14) Tim Herron; 15) Ben Crane; 16) Scott Piercy; 17) Alex Cejka / Joel Dahmen / Tyler Duncan; 20) Davis Love III. Greens in Regulation : 1) Scott Piercy; 2) Sam Ryder; 3) Emiliano Grillo; 4) Corey Conners; 5) J.J. Henry; 6) Denny McCarthy / Rory Sabbatini; 8) Kevin Tway; 9) Andrew Putnam; 10) Nate Lashley; 11) Davis Love III; 12) Tyler Duncan / Xin-Jun Zhang; 14) Jonathan Byrd; 15) Brett Stegmaier; 16) Tim Herron / Adam Schenk; 18) Martin Flores / Keith Mitchell; 20) Harris English. Putting Average (Putts per GIR) : 1) Ricky Barnes; 2) Emiliano Grillo; 3) Lanto Griffin; 4) Andres Romero; 5) Greg Chalmers / Michael Kim; 7) Scott Piercy; 8) David Lingmerth; 9) Troy Merritt; 10) Harris English / Trey Mullinax; 12) Jim Furyk / Tom Lovelady; 14) Fabian Gomez / Mike Weir; 16) Martin Flores / Ethan Tracy; 18) Robert Garrigus / Ricky Werenski; 20) Johnson Wagner.
757	757	14	14	target: Kisner-Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@FantasyGolfMan @Tour_Junkies @futureoffantasy But speaking of Bulldogs, you guys should be all over that Kisner-Brown team. Love them.
5823	5823	16	16	target: Rose’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just how much Erin Hills will actually play like a links course we don’t know but Rose’s confidence in his long game means he will be comfortable committing to a line and yardage despite not being able to see where the ball finishes. To me there are the least negatives about Rose this week. Given his major record, there is still some value in his price, his consistency means he is almost assured to play well and his adaptability means however Erin Hills plays across the four days he will be fully prepared to handle it.
443	443	7	8	target: Ian Poulter: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			I’ll let you knock the rust off. Ian Poulter: He needed to make the semifinal of WGC-Match Play to get into the Masters. He didn’t.
304	304	37	37	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This a guy who has been in a funk for most of the campaign, with three missed cuts in a row coming at the Players, Memorial and US Open. When the disappointment fades, and it will quickly, Fowler should be thrilled to have been in contention again. We know he likes this track, having chased down Henrik Stenson to win here last year.
4372	4372	9	9	target: Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
2847	2847	4	5	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Also Consider: Wesley Bryan, Jim Furyk (7/8 here, with a win in 2010), Trey Mullinax (risky on a course where he will have to club down, but will be very low owned), Ollie Schniderjans, Kyle Stanley, Lucas Glover, Cameron Smith, and Scott Brown (eight straight made cuts, T7 last season). At $7,400 he is one of my favorite values of the week that I am comfortable with in all formats. The best part about rostering him this week, is that I think he will come with a low ownership just because he is a player everyone forgets about nowadays at his age.
5259	5259	4	5	target: Rickie Fowler: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jon Rahm: $11,100  5. Rickie Fowler: $8,900  6. Dustin Johnson: $12,000  8.
10427	10427	13	13	target: Hideki 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Staples  My favorite golfers for the week – for Cash and GPP contests. Hideki Matsuyama – $11,500  This is Hideki’s event. Dominant is the only word that can describe the run Matsuyama has had at the Waste Management Open.
1681	1681	5	5	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Adding 2 additional FRLs 💰 Lahiri 80 Saunders 80
13636	13636	30	31	target: Tiger Woods' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			After. Free View in iTunes  10 Clean 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational Fantasy Golf Picks On this week's Going for the Green, DailyRoto's Mike Leone (@2hats1mike) and Colin Drew (@drewby417) recap Tiger Woods' performance at the Valspar Championship, which overshadowed Paul Casey's first Tour victory in years. They go on to break down the A.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
421	421	31	31	target: Noren 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A dialed in Sergio on a course like this is someone to keep an eye on, especially considering he’s just the 4th highest salary on the slate. Fade: I’m fading Alex Noren ($10,100) once again this week. He had two events with unsustainable ball-striking before that came back down to earth.
1481	1481	0	1	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk is 300/1? Go on then
19	19	35	36	target: Hideki Matsuyama. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Has played on the weekend in his last five starts at Wyndham, needs to play well to keep a card (he’s currently 150th on the FedEx Cup points list), and won here in 2014. Fade: Hideki Matsuyama. Played very well at Baltusrol (T-4), but wasn’t in very good form before that (three missed cuts in four previous starts) and missed the cut in each of his last two weekend starts.
12670	12670	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
13602	13602	48	49	target: Sean O’Hair 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, we can filter out some of the golfers that we just can’t trust due to poor form or a poor baseline number. These golfers should all like the course conditions this week, but they should be reserved for GPPs only:    Billy Hurley III  Sung Kang  The Specialists  Sean O’Hair  Jimmy Walker  Charley Hoffman  The specialist this week is Sean O’Hair! The Texas native has only played here twice and he is 0-for-2.
6575	6575	13	14	target: Joel Dahmen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Should be very low owned. Bottom Tier  Chad Campbell $6,900  Trey Mullinax $6,400  Joel Dahmen $6,300  Andres Gonzales $6,600  Short but sweet this week. Like I said earlier I am not a huge fan of this field/tournament but we are playing because we can’t not Degen out.
1721	1721	7	7	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
3680	3680	4	5	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him. Once on the green however, the Englishman has been lights out – 1st in Strokes Gained: Putting, 37th in One-Putt Percentage, and 55th in 3-Putt Avoidance.
7156	7156	53	53	target: Harman, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Harman's wins have come at the hands of Zach Johnson and Dustin Johnson, two major champions, and the way he steadied himself to hole the winning putt in the Wells Fargo underlines that he's better than most under the gun. I considered both Russell Henley and Kevin Kisner, who boast similar profiles to Harman, but these three are all roughly the same price even though only one of them has gone close to winning a major. It basically appears as though Harman's effort at Erin Hills has been completely overlooked and I'm not sure why, so it's worth chancing this dynamite putter to keep up the good work.
200	200	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He has missed his last two cuts, at the Shell Houston Open and the Masters. The reason Reed is priced so high this week is because of his name value, which will still draw people towards rostering him. His price is way too high to take on the risk he presents right now.
12796	12796	31	32	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is one the most top-heavy betting markets I can recall and naturally you can make cases for pretty much all at short prices. However I'm a little surprised to see Jason Day at such a price. He's lightly raced, which for me is an advantage over plenty who might be feeling jaded already in April, and he's got Augusta National pedigree which I think will give us a run for our money.
245	245	11	11	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			However, as the highest priced player in the field, you need Reed to finish T5 at worst. This is an easy fade for that reason given Reed’s inconsistent season and lack of true star power. He’s not a DJ, Rory, or Spieth.
400	400	0	1	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Patrick Reed will be my one and done. Lack of form and Andercursed! Dont @ me ... Just watch
7390	7390	32	33	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			To say the least, this course is definitely a bit of a bomber’s paradise. Obviously, this is not to say that shorter hitters won’t be able to jump all over it – Matt Kuchar has destroyed this course the past three times he’s played it – but if you have limited penalty for missing the fairway with short Par 5s and bentgrass greens, that’s pretty much the green light special for your favorite big hitters. Let’s jump into some picks.
899	899	87	88	target: Jim Furyk, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Looking at the last seven years of history at TPC Summerlin, here are the standouts:  Jason Bohn (T2-T7-T3-T19)  Russell Knox (T2-T37-T31-T30)  Shawn Stefani (T25-2)  Johnson Wagner (T8-T16-MC-T30-WIN)  J.J. Henry (T44-T23-T9-T19-T48-2)  Brian Gay (T45-T55-T5-T20-WIN-T41)  Charles Howell III (T17-MC-T6-T16-T13-T20-T38)  Chris Stroud (MC-T23-T3-T5-4-T40-T60-T12-MC)  John Huh (MC-T29-T23-WIN)  Harris English (MC-T37-WIN)    After looking at course history, let's have a glance at pure class. Here is the top 10 in the field in terms of adjusted strokes gained per round during the 2016 calendar year: Jon Rahm, Gary Woodland, Russell Knox, Emiliano Grillo, Jim Furyk, Harris English, Chris Kirk, Webb Simpson, Charles Howell III, Keegan Bradley. Combining the two lists, we get the following overlap: Russell Knox, Charles Howell III, and Harris English.
12020	12020	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1 in the world and contending week in and week out. Jason Day. Won at Bay Hill two years ago and is back to the player he was when he was No.
3	3	12	13	target: Blayne Barber 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The problem with that is Copperhead’s greens are larger with the restoration. Blayne Barber … An out-of-nowhere T3 at The Honda Classic reminded us why he’s fully exempt. The Auburn product obviously has the game for this level, but he finished inside the top 125 in earnings only last year.
860	860	0	0	target: RORY 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			RORY was expected to steamroll field in WGCs, API and *especially* Masters. He didn't. His short game not there. Overpriced.
7564	7564	12	13	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fantasy Golf on DraftKings – RBC Canadian Open  Lock of the week:  Matt Kuchar $11,400 – We all know Kuchar’s form is impeccable at the moment despite the brutal defeat at The Open Championship. This week will be another strong performance for Kuuuuuuch. The Team RBC Pro played here the past five years and has landed four T25s.
184	184	21	22	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The link makes sense given the similarities in the weather, coupled with the fact both courses are Norman designs. The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday.
8442	8442	6	7	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			4 - Bubba Watson. 3 - Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker. 2 - J.J. Henry, Jordan Spieth.
568	568	4	4	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Masters Picks Rory +850 Fowler +3500 Louie +6600 Marc +6600 Fitzpatrick +8000 Berger +10000 Everything hard no knitting around here
3343	3343	27	27	target: McIlroy’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			According to our Trends tool, golfers with a LT Adjusted Bird Avg of at least 16.5 have manufactured an +8.74 Plus/Minus at Augusta National. Birdies are good: McIlroy’s ability to string together birdies will help him achieve the Streak Bonus in FanDuel’s scoring system and has helped him average a second-best 88.7 PPT on DraftKings the past 12 months. McIlroy’s 308.3-yard LT Driving Distance ranks third, and he’s one of just eight golfers in the field with an average of at least 305 yards.
332	332	57	57	target: Rahm 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Like the golfers I mentioned above, Casey is going to be chalky so if you are playing heavy GPP this week make sure to check out my pivot plays based off FanShareSports tags at the bottom of the article. Also Consider: Brooks Koepka (T13, T17, T6, WIN, T37 last five tournaments)  Top Fade of the Week  John Rahm  World Golf Ranking (#8)  Vegas Odds (28/1)  Draftkings ($8,900)  FanDuel ($8,900)  While my fade game was completely up to snuff last week(Reavie T37 & 42nd in DK Pts), I am back at it again and this time maybe a little riskier. Last time I faded Rahm he almost won the tournament and finished Top 5 in DK points but here we are folks, post Eclipse.
3251	3251	39	40	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It’s worth noting Points won the SHO in 2013, and his record at this event is pretty spotty otherwise, but a win last week and memories of a previous victory here are too much to pass up on. Fade: J.B. Holmes. Great record here, including a recent win.
7634	7634	30	31	target: Matt Kuchar. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Our fantasy-golf experts are here to help. From picks to win to DraftKings bargains to players to avoid, here are some options for you to consider:  Brentley Romine  Projected champion: Matt Kuchar. He could be a little mentally and physically drained after the Open, but he’s playing well and loves this course.
9148	9148	15	16	target: Aaron Wise 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We’re comfortable enough with Nick in GPPs or cash game contests. Best bargain basement option:  Aaron Wise $6,900 – We love Wise this week in GPP contests as we anticipate his ownership around 5%. Wise trains at TPC Summerlin and calls it a home track.
6835	6835	25	25	target: Kim 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bottom Tier  Ryan Brehm $6,500  Harold Varner III $6,800  Robert Garrigus $6,600  BigBucksNoWhammies @BPSNow11 Value Picks O’ Tha Week  Brandon Hagy $6,700, Harold Varner, Michael Kim $6,900 –  Hagy scores points and if he makes the cut he’ll represent serious value. Kim is SO underpriced here, been solid and can rattle off birdies. Varner is a pure, shitty field high upside guy who needs a good event to crack the top 125 for playoff purposes  I’m a big fan of the mid-priced guys this week in the mid-tier section.
185	185	2	3	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The top-5  Matt Kuchar ($11,500) – Kuchar finished 4th at the Masters and backed that up with an 11th at the RBC Heritage. Kuch rescued his week at Harbour Town as he so often does in the final round, shooting a 64 on Sunday. He has steady form here, with his 42nd last year by far and away his worst finish.
2424	2424	2	3	target: Tyrrell Hatton. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Dark Horse. Tyrrell Hatton. First PGA tournament of the year for him.
6231	6231	8	9	target: Patrick Reed, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Fowler is fifth in birdie-or-better percentage this season. Patrick Reed, $9800 – Though not the best tee-to-green player in the field, Reed makes up for it with strong putting and recent form. Reed was T13 at the U.S. Open and T5 at last week’s Travelers Championship.
11506	11506	1	1	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Tony Finau $8,500 – Speaking of DraftKings scoring, guess who’s number 4 in the field? Yep, Mr. Tony Finau himself. Finau’s game quickly got right back into form with a T2nd at the Genesis despite a missed cut a couple weeks prior at the Waste Management.
318	318	20	21	target: Brian Harman 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Either way, he'll go a long way to mend fences with a strong week, but debutants aren't encouraged at Firestone. Brian Harman … Playing the lights out all year, but this is just his second career appearance in a World Golf Championship. Full-season gamers should be content with this as a bonus start and guaranteed points.
2575	2575	22	22	target: Jordan 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Since we have no course history we need to focus on recent form and he beat a deep field last time out. Jordan Spieth $11,500 – I really like Jordan to have a strong showing this week. The normal distance he is behind off the tee should be smaller this week and he has been putting very well.
11932	11932	1	1	target: Fowler's 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Rickie Fowler's shoes - a tribute to Arnold Palmer  Justin Rose has a strong course record but was terribly disappointing on Sunday, Rory McIlroy appears further from peak form than Fowler and there are form and fitness concerns about Henrik Stenson. With Hideki Matsuyama returning from injury, that leaves Jason Day and Tommy Fleetwood as the two other serious players and both are respected, but it's Florida resident Fowler who is much preferred on this occasion. There have been some skinners here - two of them courtesy of Matt Every - and at monster prices I'd advise you not to totally overlook Collin Morikawa.
13297	13297	72	73	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A roster construction of six players from the $7,500-$10,000 range might be the best way to go this week. RBC Heritage (aka The Luke Donald Open) Harbour Town GL  7,099 Yards | Par 71  29/50 in 2017 Difficulty (-0.325) WINNERS Bryan -13  Grace -9  Furyk -18  Kuchar -11  GMAC -9  Pettersson -14  Snedeker -12  Furyk -13  Gay -20  BOO -15  BOO -14  Baddeley -14 pic.twitter.com/8zCOUDB8yM — Patrick Mayo (@ThePME) April 9, 2018  Tyrrell Hatton ($8,800) could very well be the most expensive player you need to roster. He played better over the weekend at Augusta but expressed his frustration about his game all week on Twitter.
34	34	4	4	target: Webb 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For all you $10,200 Webb truthers out there, you better play him at $6,000 this week. Apparently course history is worth about $4,000.
456	456	8	9	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year. Over the past five years, the defending champion has only finished better than 14th place once — and that was Jordan Spieth, whose runner-up result in 2016 wasn’t exactly cause for celebration.
12038	12038	44	45	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The stats prove out that 70-75% of the advantage winners have enjoyed over the field can be traced to those two factors. It’s no surprise that eight-time champ Tiger Woods has excelled in these two factors in his career, but other former champions in Jason Day, Marc Leishman, and Ernie Els have shined in these facets as well. With nearly perfect weather in the forecast this week, look for plenty of birdies and drama to unfold, especially with Tiger back in form at his old stomping grounds for the first time in five years.
50	50	0	0	target: Oosthuizen 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Oosthuizen bad value #DFS PGA pick on DraftKings this week. His $/pt worse than ave (line) on handy GP chart! #golf https://t.co/DBsQqJOXkZ
462	462	10	10	target: Rahm’s 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			This isn’t the tournament for those who become easily frustrated. Rahm’s time will come, but not this week. Sergio Garcia (+2735)  As much as some players seem like horse-for-the-course selections at Augusta, the recent champions haven’t repeated with much success the next year.
63	63	24	25	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2010 - Atwal - PM -9/61. For the record, here's the breakdown of Bermudagrass PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas. 3 - Ernie Els, Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Camilo Villegas.
1028	1028	7	7	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			TOC Picks Winner- Hideki Contenders - Spieth JT Koepka Longish- Xander Henley Cam
1245	1245	63	64	target: Bubba Watson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We don't have to look any further back than last year to see that Jordan Spieth mastered Kapalua with his wedges and putter, not his driver -- more on that in the Champions Profile below. Spieth is among only 11 returnees from last year in the 32-man field, and there are only four who have even played the past two years (Jason Day, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, the latter two being the only golfers to play the past three years). Spieth, Reed and Dustin Johnson are the former champions in the no-cut field.
5434	5434	20	20	target: Chappell 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chappell could easily fall between the cracks as he is competing with this week’s chalk, Kyle Stanley at $8,400. If Chappell hadn’t won a few weeks back at the Valero Texas Open, I honestly believe this would be the event we all would be saying was his to win. William McGirt – $7,300  Why is nobody talking about McGirt?!
12883	12883	28	29	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
13158	13158	12	13	target: Kevin Kisner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm expecting a big challenge from Cantlay at 33/1. Next Best: Back Kevin Kisner e.w. @ 33/1  Dustin Johnson could run away with this.
5574	5574	59	59	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
5150	5150	30	30	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only red flags are three missed cuts the last three years at Muirfield. However, his price reflects this risk a bit too much in my opinion, so I’m backing Fowler as a value play and possible differentiator in lineups this week. Justin Thomas, $9000 – Among the better tee-to-green players on Tour right now, Thomas is enjoying a breakout season with three victories and four other top-10s.
491	491	24	25	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From here on out I will give my recommendations based on where you lie in the standings. Leading or wanting to play it safe: Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott    Still in contention: Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jordan Spieth    Need to make up a lot of ground: Gary Woodland, John Senden, Louis Oosthuizen, Emiliano Grillo, Zach Johnson, Chris Kirk, Charl Schwartzel    Finau came up big last week but I'm still a ways out of things in my league. This week I will choose another one from the final group and pick Chris Kirk.
7110	7110	12	12	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m thinking the odds are in his favor. Sergio Garcia… Much like Fowler, he’s elite when it comes to playing in the elements. It’s no wonder he’s pieced together 10 top 10s in 20 Open Championship appearances.
1760	1760	46	46	target: Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes TPC Scottsdale is not his most productive course, but you know exactly what you are getting and he finished 2016 on a high after winning the Shark Shootout with Harris English. For a solid anchor in your team this week, a combination of Moore and Kuchar will take some beating. $10million+ Salary Players :  Positive : Only the 3 players above $10 million this week and if I had to choose one I'd go for Jordan Spieth.
1442	1442	0	0	target: DJ’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			DJ’s Pro-Am partner is usually ole father in law for this event isn’t it? Between that and his history here.. I can… https://t.co/vZJDFCJNsS
228	228	11	12	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			One To Swerve  Of the elite, I’m not really convinced that Henrik Stenson is playing well enough and his record in this event is modest. I’ll reveal my full line-up in Tuesday’s Playing The Tips feature. Does he have the calmness needed for this event?
11376	11376	48	49	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			78.3% scrambling on his last start, which ranked 5th in the field, is also interesting given what we saw here last year and although this is his course debut, I can see him hitting the ground running this week. RESULT: T27  Although he doesn't possess the length of Bubba Watson or Tony Finau, Matthew Fitzpatrick more than makes up for that with his tee-to-green game and there's an awful lot to like about his chances this week. Having taken a break following his missed cut in Dubai - which followed a run of 10 consecutive top-20 finishes - the 23 year-old will be ready to go this week having focused on some of the more technical aspects of his game over the past few weeks.
539	539	2	2	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
440	440	14	15	target: Lee Westwood: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Shane Lowry: His best finish on TOUR in seven events in 2018 is T43. Lee Westwood: MC, MC, T-11 and T40 in his last four worldwide hardly inspires. His MC-MC-MC the last three years at GCH doesn’t either.
2102	2102	32	32	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Lahiri ranks above average in Driving Accuracy (T68) and whilst he is not the longest is also no slouch off the tee. As suggested, it would be a huge step up for Lahiri should he win this week but I think he is ready. He already has a top-5 to his name in a major (2015 PGA Championship) so I don’t see why he can’t mix it with the best in a similar field.
5785	5785	129	262	target: Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B. Holmes +10000 +10000 Jason Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
291	291	35	36	target: Dustin Johnson... 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The Sportsbook only go 11/5 about Day missing the cut but even that's tempting. I really don't fancy him at all but the one I really want to take on at the prices available is Dustin Johnson... The world number one looked unbeatable in early spring but since he fell down the stairs in his rented house at Augusta prior to the US Masters, when he was forced to withdraw, he's not been the same and like McIlroy and Day, he too has missed his last two cuts.
436	436	17	18	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Bogey-free rounds: 2014 (14), 2015 (one million), 2016 (13) and 2017 (9). Low round of 2017: 65; Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy (Saturday). #GustyWeekend.
8178	8178	21	21	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			If he can keep it going on the greens, he very well could win a second week in a row. Like Fowler, Matsuyama has never won a major, but he doesn't carry nearly the baggage that Fowler does. Tier 2 Values    Matt Kuchar - $8,800 (50-1)    While we picked four of the top-5 guys on the DraftKings board in Tier 1, we're dropping way down in price for Tier 2, bypassing the low-$10,000 and all the $9,000 guys, including Brooks Koepka.
299	299	233	234	target: Anirban Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Within this grouping, we see world rankings between #17 and #169 and odds to win between 65/1 to 288/1 so there is a lot to break down here. The Players  Player Odds To Win Official World Golf Ranking Form (Wins – Top 10’s – ) Dylan Fritelli 271 82 1 – 3 – 10/18 Joost Luiten 199 80 0 – 1 – 12/13 Byeong Hun-An 130 60 0 – 3 -16/17 Kevin Chappell 143 28 1 – 3 – 11/14 Ross Fisher 92 43 0 – 5 – 9/13 Charley Hoffman 135 39 0 – 4 – 15/19 Kevin Kisner 125 25 1 – 5 – 13/15 Hideto Tanihara 159 50 0 – 2 – 5/8 Rafa Cabrara-Bello 65 17 1 – 6 – 14/19 Daniel Berger 80 20 1 – 5 – 11/15 Bryson Dechambeau 141 81 1 – 2 – 8/20 Charles Howell 157 55 0 – 3 – 12/12 Pablo Larrazabel 229 102 0 – 3 – 12/16 Richie Ramsay 229 169 0 – 1 – 10/15 Ryan Fox 175 95 0 – 4 – 12/16 Fabizio Zanotti 288 97 1 – 2 – 8/14 Wesley Bryan 254 36 1 – 5 – 11/17 Kyle Stanley 161 58 1 – 4 – 14/16 Jason Dufner 126 31 1 – 1 – 11/15 Bill Haas 134 37 0 – 1 – 11/14 Brian Harman 126 27 1 – 7 – 13/17 Anirban Lahiri 196 67 0 – 3 – 11/16  What this all means? From the data it would seem a few players stand out as obvious players to put into your lineups and that others are avoidable.
6424	6424	2	3	target: Bryson DeChambeau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Result: DQ  Bryson DeChambeau 0.75pt EW 90/1 with Bet £10 get £60 in bonuses using promo code SPORTS60 (5 places, 1/4 odds):  Bryson DeChambeau is a little like a box of chocolates, you just never know what you are going to get. However, this is the kind of low-key tournament where a talent like DeChambeau could fire, challenge and more than likely take the title. If we're looking for a motive, it appears that Bryson has noticed that he's outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and clearly he doesn't want to go through the stress of the web.com Playoffs again.
434	434	1	2	target: Anirban Lahiri: 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Sayonara. Anirban Lahiri: His travel schedule has been LAX-PBI-DEL-MCO in four of the last five weeks. That by definition is jet lag.
6970	6970	3	4	target: Scott Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			(cash and gpp)  Scott Brown ($7,000) – I’m not as high on him as some may be but can’t hurt at his price if need the savings. (cash and gpp)  Hunter Mahan ($7,000) – Total gpp flyer but he’s playing better and popping in my models for this course. I think so.
3841	3841	43	44	target: Martin Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Field  We lose a lot of the top players we saw last week unfortunately as many choose to take this week off after a taxing run-up to the year’s first major. However, some great international players are in attendance including Tyrell Hatton, Martin Kaymer and 2016 Masters Champion, Danny Willett. Matt Kuchar, Kevin Kisner and last year’s runner-up Russell Knox will also be in attendance making it a pretty intriguing but very wide-open event, with no overwhelming favorite.
4372	4372	8	9	target: Martin Laird 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We like McGirt in cash or GPP contests. Martin Laird $7,100 – Laird is another guy with ties to the area according to Paul Tesori. He’s coming off a top 20 at the Valero, and he’s another ball striker type that can survive a little wind that could rear it’s head on Eagle Point being only one mile from the Atlantic.
10188	10188	20	20	target: (Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The course suits his monster hitting (currently second in Driving Distance), it's a coastal track where it can really blow (Finau won his only Tour title by the sea at the windy Puerto Rico Open and has played well in his two Open Championship starts) and it features Poa Annua greens. Finau is ranked 12th on the Future of Fantasy's list of top performers on Poa since 2013/14. In theory he should flourish, but what about the reality?
271	271	2	2	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I like Finau on the poa but too many guys for me this week cant own everyone. Wouldn't surpise me at all if his nam… https://t.co/egaitQT3lq
12458	12458	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is TRENDING toward the winner's circle. Jim Furyk (44.67 Projected Pts): They say class is permanent but Furyk still finds himself outside the top 25 in the raw pre-draft rankings. He's playing out of the Past Champions category this season, allowing himself plenty of time to play his way back into old Furyk form.
12885	12885	53	54	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			In an event where the those leading 12 players or so are taking up so much of the market I want to have another one onside so I’m taking a slightly Jeremy Chapman approach this week (to be fair I’d happily settle for his sort of profit on the week!) and also backing Jason Day. The general 18/1 is just too tempting for someone who ticks so many of the right Augusta boxes.
2417	2417	26	27	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Plus, I think he’ll figure things out soon, so one-and-done gamers shouldn’t worry too much about his current struggles. • • •  Dan Kilbridge  Projected champion: Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
13112	13112	40	41	target: Si Woo 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Then he has backed this up with a solid 25th place finish at Augusta to make the cut in the Masters for the first time. The thing that makes these two finishes of particular interest to me is that when Si Woo has won his two PGA tour titles to date he hasn’t come in to the events on a blinding run of form, but has actually won events following steady 25th & 22nd place finishes. So in summary we have a world class proven winner, on a perfect track for his game rounding in to steady form.
190	190	18	18	target: Reed, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Zach switched clubs at the start of 2016, moving to PXG and has not been convincing since. With Reed, all is not well with him right now, what the problem is, I have no idea. Seaworthy Timber  Adam Hadwin $9,100  Brendan Steele $9,900  Tony Finau $8,400  Cabin Crew  Ryan Moore $10,200  J.J Spaun $7,800  Anirban Lahiri $7,300  Salty Old Seadogs  Luke Donald $8,700  Scott Piercy $6,900  Matt Jones $6,300  Stowaways  Jhonattan Vegas $8,100  Harold Varner $7,800  Cameron Smith $7,300  Cabin Boys  Ollie Schniederjans $8,200  J.T Poston $6,900  Sung Kang $7,400  Finally, Kevin Na has withdrawn from this week’s tournament.
7624	7624	54	55	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This isn’t incredibly groundbreaking information, but you’ll want to roster golfers who can take advantage of the short Par 5s and who are in good recent form in terms of accuracy. The Studs  While there are three guys priced above $10,000 this week, they’re all spread out: Dustin Johnson is at $12,200 on DraftKings, Matt Kuchar is at $11,400, and Charley Hoffman is at $10,300. Of note, because of the weaker field, DJ’s price tag is relatively in line with most weeks — he was $12,000 last week at the British, for example — whereas Kuchar and Hoffman have price increases of $4,200 and $3,600, respectively.
12668	12668	20	21	target: Phil Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			However, the rise of so many candidates for the Masters eases our challenge for Houston. Whether you're pacing or chasing, Phil Mickelson will serve the purpose in either event. You know he's a three-time winner of the Masters, but it might surprise you that he's also the all-time earnings leader in the tournament.
328	328	13	14	target: William McGirt 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Last year's T10 at Sedgefield occurred amid a stretch of consistently strong form. William McGirt … Now 0-for-3 since The Open Championship with the withdrawal in Canada sandwiched in there. Has a pair of top 15s at Sedgefield, but he's also finished outside the top 50 four times.
110	110	29	30	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Again you can expect some degree of inaccuracy this week when it comes to ownership due to the fact that there are a lot fewer golfers in the field. Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas come in as potential low owned candidates for GPPs which is interesting because I could certainly see either of the two winning this week. As was the case with Walker, McIlroy and Thomas have been known to suffer from inaccuracy from time to time so I have some similar concerns with these two.
8868	8868	45	45	target: JT 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Justin Thomas – $9,900  This is a rare one. Despite the elite of elite at the top of the DraftKings pricing, starting lineups with Justin Thomas, an elite player in his own right, allows you to create loaded lineups from top to bottom. At $9,900, JT provides you with the winning potential and savings required this week.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
8335	8335	30	30	target: Mullinax 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The former University of Alabama golfer can score in bunches and has finally had a couple weeks rest after playing nearly 10 events in a row trying to earn points. Mullinax is a GPP play for sure. Player to avoid:  Henrik Stenson $11,500 – Stenson is clearly the class of the field, but that doesn’t make him an automatic play.
10093	10093	3	3	target: Kizzire’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The win is Kizzire’s second win of the young 2017-18 golf season and it boosted his standing in the World Golf Rankings. Less than three months ago, Kizzire was ranked outside of the Top 300; he is now number 54 in the world. The Sony Open took place in Hawaii where a ballistic missile alert was sent out mistakenly Saturday morning.
12072	12072	11	18	target: Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.
1423	1423	19	19	target: Dufner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’ll take one of the best putters in the world at +2300 here. Not many guys are talking about Dufner this week. I’m plugging him into the majority of my Draft Kings teams as well as buying him at +5000 to win the Sony.
8880	8880	0	1	target: Brice Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20. His up and down play makes him an unnecessary risk in cash formats but I like his high ceiling for GPP formats.
12396	12396	11	12	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			It's annual tradition in this space, so let's line 'em up. Jason Day. *Justin Thomas.
11509	11509	38	38	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Finau has gained almost 22 Strokes on the field in his last 3 events fueled by an approach game that has been absolute fire. Throw in that we are stealing him at $8500 and we will gladly play Finau as one of our core plays for the week. Xander Shauffele $7,800 – Xander has been a model of consistency this season with 2 top ten finishes and only one missed cut in his last 8 starts.
348	348	9	10	target: Rory McIlroy 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Note iron off the tee. Must be tight if Rory McIlroy is choosing to hit an iron off a tee. https://t.co/2SgKeWiZLe
2734	2734	12	13	target: Ryan Moore 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			So I'm dipping a little deeper in the betting market this week. Ryan Moore ticks plenty of boxes this week at a course where he tends to play well. At a test where scoring is likely to be difficult, an experienced level-head is no bad thing.
2039	2039	9	10	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Like the two above, we’re all in. CORE 2  Patrick Reed 60% – His price and record at this course is excellent value. Dustin Johnson 40% – Record speaks for itself.
5585	5585	1	2	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Matt Kuchar, $7,600  It’s never exciting to click Kuchar thanks to a perceived low ceiling. After all, he’s never won a major.
339	339	57	58	target: Justin Rose 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Currier also remarked that the course will play toughest if firm and fast are possible. The forecast, listed below, might just help that happen…  New Courses Recently Used on Tour (winner):  WGC-Mexico: Dustin Johnson  Eagle Point: Brian Harman  QLN: Kyle Stanley  Open Championship: Jordan Spieth  WGC-Match Play 2016: Jason Day  Albany Club 2015: Bubba Watson  Olympic Games: Justin Rose (g), Henrik Stenson (s) and Matt Kuchar (b). Oakmont: Dustin Johnson  I could go on.
13053	13053	35	35	target: Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful. Today wasn't any different than it was 10 years ago when I played with him," said 1992 Masters winner after playing a practice round with Woods on Monday. The "Tiger is back" message continues to gather speed and many believe that this is the week where he'll complete his incredible renaissance after looking as if he might never play competitively again due to the mass surgeries.
282	282	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
5965	5965	39	40	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not to say its adverse to bombers, as Bubba Watson is a two-time tournament champ. Moreover, while the Travelers usually lacks the marquee names of other tour stops, this year's field is loaded with the likes of Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed. If you want to win at River Highlands, prepare to go low.
11494	11494	19	20	target: Thomas Pieters, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He’s a somewhat risky option but is priced modestly given he won the last time he teed it up. Thomas Pieters, $9500 – A very long hitter who drove his way to a top-5 at last year’s WGC-Mexico, Pieters represents the youthful talent in today’s game. After a T13 at last week’s Honda Classic where he shot no worse than 1-over in any round on a very tough track, Pieters is well positioned to excel this week.
2857	2857	1	2	target: Kevin Na 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			6. Kevin Na - Na is not the most reliable guy this season, unlike his start to last season. However, he cashes checks, and he occasionally contends.
45	45	13	13	target: Furyk 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Knox was T-2 here last year, so he’s comfortable here. Also like: Jim Furyk and Jon Rahm. Furyk is another guy who hits it straight and should love this course.
11369	11369	31	31	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A winner at the CareerBuilder Challenge in January, he’s just cooled off a little with a run of 29-11-26 in West Coast events in which he was 1-16-5 last year. Tommy Fleetwood  Despite winning in Abu Dhabi and boasting lots of excellent form at the end of 2016, Fleetwood was a big outsider here last year, some bookies quoting him at 200/1. But, riding the wave of confidence, the Englishman had a great time and rounded off a golden week by draining a 40-footer at the last to finish solo second.
6542	6542	14	15	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The high price tag may even drive his ownership down a bit. Value Plays:  Keegan Bradley $9,400 – Keegan is coming off back to back T10s the last two weeks. He’s never missed a cut at the Greenbrier in four appearances here with one T10.
4732	4732	37	38	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He is still fresh off of The Masters victory, and is also the defending champion of this event. However, it is so rare to see Sergio priced as the second highest golfer, especially with Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the field. That $11K price tag is a scary number and will certainly keep Garcia’s ownership down.
5413	5413	86	86	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There doesn’t appear to be any rain in the forecast for Memphis throughout the tournament, but temperatures are expected to heat up on Saturday and Sunday. Past Champions    2016 - Daniel Berger  2015 - Fabian Gomez  2014 - Ben Crane  2013 - Harris English  2012 - Dustin Johnson  2011 - Harrison Frazar  2010 - Lee Westwood  2009 - Brian Gay    FantasyDraft Value Picks - based on $100,000 salary cap    Cream of the Crop  Brooks Koepka - $18,000  Adam Scott - $17,600  Francesco Molinari - $17,100  Phil Mickelson - $16,900    Cash-game Target (50/50s, Double-Ups): Despite earning headlines for his decision to skip next week’s U.S. Open in order to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, Mickelson is a safe deployment at the top of cash-game lineups this week. He hasn’t missed a single cut all season and has produced four consecutive quality results at this event with finishes of T2-T11-T3-T2 since 2013.
20	20	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			He’s in the latter category, of course, which means that his worthy short game will feel added pressure with scoring at a premium. Rickie Fowler … This remains relative, but the squawkers who were troubled by his omission in last week’s Power Rankings were silenced by a T22 despite a consistent barrage of red numbers at Sedgefield. He scored 10-under 67-67-68-68=270 en route to what was his best finish in an event with a full field since a T4 at Quail Hollow in early May.
12883	12883	29	29	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Despite his current winning ratio though this might still be a year or two too early for Thomas at a course that generally takes a lot of learning. Jason Day (18/1) – Masters record: 2-WD-3-20-28-10-22, 2017 form: 12-MC-5-64-23-WD  Despite his win at Torrey Pines in February the form of others means Day is sneaking in under the radar a little. If there was one player in the field that Augusta was almost custom-built for it is Jason Day.
231	231	41	42	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Regardless, I still believe his ownership alone is worth using him in cash games, as he’ll provide some savings for the rest of your lineup as well. Others to Consider in Cash  Dustin Johnson ($11900)  Brooks Koepka ($10100)  Adam Scott ($9500)  Patrick Reed ($8800)  Jim Furyk ($8600) (Just inside Top 100. Needs to make cut to advance to Deutsche Bank)  Charl Schwartzel ($8500)  Russell Knox ($7300)  Daniel Berger ($6900)  Charles Howell III ($6500)  Kevin Kisner ($6400)  William McGirt ($6100) (T10 finish in 2012)  Others to Consider in GPP  Jason Day ($12400)  Rory McIlroy ($11600)  Hideki Matsuyama ($9900)  Bubba Watson ($9100)  Jimmy Walker ($8200)  Graham DeLaet ($6800) (Currently outside Top 100, finished T5 in 2012)  Lucas Glover ($6600)  Francesco Molinari ($6000)  Johnson Wagner ($5800)  Roberto Castro ($5700)  Jamie Lovemark ($5600)  **** Check out this exclusive offer for RotoCurve members.
7911	7911	36	37	target: Adam Scott. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Golfers who you might not miss in the Playoffs and warrant consideration this week include Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler, Charl Schwartzel and Paul Casey. If you need a jolt, don't wait on Rose, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott. If you're front-running and perhaps limited with who's still on your board, Marc Leishman is your guy.
337	337	21	23	target: Si Woo Kim 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			There has been a rookie appear at East Lake every year with the exception of 2014. Emiliano Grillo and reclassified rookie Si Woo Kim kept the trend alive last year. Only Jordan Spieth and Billy Horschel have MC at The Barclays and have gone on to win the title.
13052	13052	68	69	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			While his habit of making too many mistakes at this venue casts doubt over his Green Jacket chances, contending shouldn't be an issue and it's worth noting that his top 10 percentage (58%) over the last 50 events is higher than anyone's in the field. Last four events: 59-7-16-2  Course form: 4-6-MC-13_38-38-30  Last 10 majors: 13-54-MC-MC-9-1-4-7-49-2  Last 50 starts - Win: 16%, Top 5: 42%, Top 10: 58%  Tiger Woods - Place wager the best way to back Tiger  "If you watched him play today, there's not much of a back problem. He's hitting it a long way, and it looks beautiful.
1105	1105	7	8	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Driving Accuracy  High-Priced Tier: $9,000 and Higher  Jim Furyk — coming off a disappointing missed cut last week — leads the high-priced tier and is 10th in the field with a 68.2 percent Long-Term (LT) DA. Furyk’s 68.8 LT Adjusted Round Score (Adj Rd Score) ranks second in the field, but he did not play well last week. Furyk does have excellent course history here: He finished third and T11 in his only two appearances in 2011 and 2012.
21	21	16	16	target: Varner 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			“We have a good time. … It just gets your mind away from everything.”  Not that Varner is feeling any anxiety heading into his debut at TPC Sawgrass. Pressure doesn’t faze him.
1314	1314	0	0	target: Xander 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Xander 90/1? Hmmmm.
2763	2763	15	16	target: Bill Haas. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This is a course that fits him well, which explains his P-2 here last year. Bill Haas. Not great in Mexico but not bad, either.
13299	13299	15	15	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Even though he is priced as the 11th– most expensive player on DK, DailyRoto gives Hatton the fourth-best win probability (2.66%). Putting and short game are going to be a huge factor this week and Hatton is fifth in SG Putting and fourth in Proximity to the Hole Around the Green. This is a steal at just $8,800.
9707	9707	45	45	target: Dufner, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This week, a similar course history can be seen with three missed cuts and only one top ten in seven appearances. It’s tough to tell if the course history will keep ownership down or if the price discrepancy will result in a high ownership of Dufner, check back to our Slack Chat later in the week to see where our experts are leaning on Dufner as more information arises throughout the week. Chez Reavie – FanDuel Value – DK: $8000 FD: $9300  Reavie is showing up as one of the top value plays according to our DFS Research Station.
7479	7479	3	4	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Open’s runner-up, Matt Kuchar, is the model’s top golfer and this week’s Levitanimal. Kuchar has finished inside the top-10 here in each of the past three years the Canadian Open has been played at Glen Abbey: His 68.1 Course Adj Rd Score ranks second in this week’s field. But it’s not just Kuchar’s course history that’s hot like fiya: Kuchar’s 67.4 Recent Adj Rd Score leads the field, thanks in part to six straight finishes of 16th or better, including three finishes of fourth or better.
5686	5686	39	40	target: Paul Casey 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Just like Dufner 2 weeks ago and Bello last week recency bias is real and he could be that guy this week after his missed cut at the St. Jude, which I’m not worried about at all. Middle Range  Paul Casey $8,400 – He currently sits as the second highest rated golfer in my model. Knock on wood he hasn’t missed a cut since I mushed him with my One and Done pick in Hawaii.
544	544	4	5	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Keep an eye on Patrick Reed this week. Hometown with family in town. Loves the course. His price is way to low imo.
8854	8854	6	7	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alright, lets get to the picks! Matt Kuchar @ $7,700  Matt Kuchar is one of the most consistent golfers on the PGA Tour. He seems to always make his way towards the top of the leaderboard no matter how the week starts on Thursday.
6976	6976	33	33	target: Hearn 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He also has a runner up finish at this event back in 2012. If you want to completely fade the chalk in the low $8K range and cannot stomach to roster Bubba Watson, Hearn is your best bet. William McGirt – $7,700  William McGirt has had a less than stellar season so far, rarely finding his way inside the top 20.
6353	6353	44	45	target: J.B. Holmes, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This doesn’t mean you should avoid them completely because looking elsewhere is a bit daunting this week with such a weak field in play. On the flip side, you might find some value in low ownership among guys like Billy Hurley, Russell Henley and J.B. Holmes, all of which I think make solid GPP plays given their deflated ownership numbers. Click To Enlarge!
11221	11221	1	2	target: Sergio Garcia 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2. Sergio Garcia (DraftKings $10,500, FanDuel $11,900): The reigning Masters champ will continue his preparation to defend his green jacket this week. He actually started his season six weeks ago in Singapore with a win at the Singapore Open, but of course that field wasn't nearly as strong as this one.
12075	12075	25	26	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			There’s a group of Americans adding even more name recognition, too. Kevin Kisner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Kevin Chappell, Zach Johnson, Ryan Moore, Luke List, Keegan Bradley, Jimmy Walker and Ollie Schniederjans will be at Bay Hill. And, because of the API’s invitational status, we’ll get a crop of fresh faces to complete on a big stage.

11907	11907	30	31	target: Tiger Woods 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3rd here in 2011 came after a 5th the week before at Copperhead where he'd shot 74 on Sunday to not convert a 54-hole lead. 2nd here in 2013 to Tiger Woods came after an 8th at Doral on his last outing. It's clear though that Rose has never arrived in Orlando, the city where he used to live, in such a rich vein of putting form.
1811	1811	18	19	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chalk will be abundant this week, so a pivot to Fowler will definitely separate you from the field. Zach Johnson – $8,100  The low $8K range has drawn a lot of attention this week, mainly because of Padraig Harrington’s egregious price tag. There are very popular picks in this range as well – Mickelson, Watson and Steele are the names that pop out.
4498	4498	23	23	target: Kaymer 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The one real blot on his career was a terrible record at the Masters. Augusta National messed with his head so much that Kaymer even tried to change his swing to have more success there. Unfortunately, it made little difference to his Masters performances but seemed to affect his results everywhere else as he wasn't comfortable drawing the ball.
1589	1589	9	9	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I think what he is trying to say is Hatton is winning this week https://t.co/sol9J6nzZ6
3606	3606	70	71	target: Paul Casey: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Alternate Lineups  Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth will be popular, but they're too good to completely fade. DJ is playing at an unreal level right, Spieth has an unbelievable track record at Augusta, and I want each of them in some of my lineups, plus there are a bunch of mid-tier players who I like, so here are a couple optional routes to consider:  Jordan Spieth: $11,500    Justin Rose: $9,200    Paul Casey: $7,800    Matthew Fitzpatrick: $7,400    Marc Leishman: $7,100    Adam Hadwin: $6,900  Dustin Johnson: $11,300    Phil Mickelson: $8,700    Jon Rahm: $8,600    Rafa Cabrera-Bello: $7,200    Brendan Steele: $7,100    J.B. Holmes: $7,100
296	296	1	2	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Patrick Reed -- It was impossible to ignore Reed last week on Long Island, and it's hard to see why he doesn't deserve a look again this week. He's in America Mode.
5891	5891	15	16	target: Bubba Watson: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Russell Knox: 22nd PGA/30th Open/10th Scottish Open/54th Firestone. Bubba Watson: MC US Open/42nd TPC Sawgrass/29th Shenzhen/38th Augusta. Kevin Streelman: MC US Open/MC St Jude/MC Memorial/MC TPC Sawgrass.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
10364	10364	37	37	target: Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's earned $100K or more in four of his last eight visits to TPC Scottsdale. Don't get too caught up on last week's missed cut, because this is an event that usually brings out the best in Fowler. Fowler is one of the golfers that has fallen victim to Matsuyama's dominance here, losing in a 2016 playoff.
192	192	86	87	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			The other surprise name here is Nick Taylor, which tells us as much as we need to know about the strength of this event. Tournament scoring average:  (note prior to 2010, the tournament was played at La Cantera, an easier scoring venue, hence a number of veterans on this list)  player Events Av Score Ryan Armour 2 67.83 Luke Donald 3 68.42 Rory Sabbatini 5 68.83 Hunter Mahan 6 69.06 Bob Estes 12 69.34 Alex Cejka 4 69.36 Ben Crane 6 69.45 Charley Hoffman 11 69.57 Zach Johnson 6 69.59 Nick Watney 4 69.93 John Senden 10 69.94 Harold Varner III 1 70 Stewart Cink 2 70 Justin Leonard 13 70.04 Greg Owen 4 70.13  Recent form:  Rafael Campos Adam Hadwin Brendan Steele Tony Finau Anirban Lahiri Ollie Schniederjans Jhonnattan Vegas J.J Spaun Matt Kuchar Graeme McDowell  Campos is another that looks like an ‘outlier’ at first glance. However, he has top tens in Puerto Rico (windy) and Houston (Texas) as well as a 32nd last week at the Heritage.
70	70	0	1	target: Jim Furyk: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jim Furyk: Ryder Cup captains pick narrative + FedExCup/BMW bubble narrative + great course history = I'm buying some
5651	5651	3	3	target: Dunne 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			1pt each-way Paul Dunne at 400/1 Sky Bet (8 places;1/5 odds) This might seem a big ask but US Open’s have a habit of producing the odd funny result. His excellent short game should keep him in contention and it wasn’t that long ago that he lost in a playoff at the Trophee Hassan.
352	352	8	10	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			T4 in last start. Fade of the Week  Charles Howell III  How much I hate to say this, I think Chuckie 3 Stix misses the cut this week. Could he top 10?
5574	5574	59	59	target: Fowler 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			On the back of compatriot Garcia's Augusta heroics, - “of course it was inspirational” - Rahm has a real shot of continuing Spain’s dream run in the sport while matching the incomparable Severiano Ballesteros' young age in bagging that first major. If Phil Mickelson fails to make his tee-time (which seems highly likely) following his daughter’s high-school graduation, then Fowler will become firm favourite for the local support while sporting a bag daubed in the colours of the Green Bay Packers. While Rahm is on a fast-track to the upper echelons, Fowler’s progress has been more steady but the time has arrived for him to really establish himself among the elite.
8538	8538	2	3	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			*  PICKS! Jason Day – GPP – DK: $9700 FD: $9300  These last two events I have been on Jason Day as he has continued to trend in the right direction with the lowest ownership of any player priced in the ‘elite’ category. I expect this to continue this week despite coming off of a top ten finish at the PGA Championship despite a quadruple bogey.
1535	1535	4	4	target: Loupe 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bodog had to make Loupe 1000/1 to sucker me in. And they did.
9517	9517	26	27	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The only three winners from last season that will not attend are Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, and Henrik Stenson. Leading the class will be Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, Hideki Matsuyama, Jon Rahm, and Brooks Koepka. With only 34 players in the field, this is a very strong, talented group, and all of them have experienced what it’s like to battle it out on Sunday.
1479	1479	31	32	target: Zach Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Current form and tournament form is available to view here: Current Form | Tournament Form . Bermudagrass PGA Tour Victors : In this week's field since 2008:  4 - Bill Haas, Zach Johnson, Patrick Reed. 3 - Brian Gay, Geoff Ogilvy, Ryan Palmer, Camilo Villegas.
890	890	9	10	target: Keegan Bradley, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			120 for very long. Was going to go with Keegan Bradley, coming off two finishes of T-7 or better, but his play in Vegas pushed him back inside the top 100, at No. 97.
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
12471	12471	24	25	target: Retief Goosen 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Combining Baseline Strokes Gained with Current Form and Specialist Rating, we get a Top 20 ranking that looks like this:  Emiliano Grillo  Patrick Rodgers  Retief Goosen  Scott Piercy  Martin Flores  Trey Mullinax  Chris Wood  Brice Garnett  Troy Merritt  Rafael Campos  Cameron Tringale  Tom Lovelady  Joel Dahmen  Ricky Barnes  Lanto Griffin  Fabrizio Zanotti  Adam Schenk  Keith Mitchell  Corey Conners  Jim Furyk  Looks like a pretty good-looking list to me. I would probably drop Goosen and Flores a bit while booston Mitchell and Furyk a bit. Best of luck everyone!

Poston; 18) Charles Howell III / Adam Schenk; 20) Stewart Cink / Emiliano Grillo.
5820	5820	6	6	target: Rose 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Not always the best of chippers, Rose should enjoy being able to putt around the fringes as his lag putting is very strong. But the clincher with Rose this week is how he has played on courses similar to Erin Hills. Rose was 4th at Whistling Straits, 12th at Pinehurst No.2 but the most interesting one is his Scottish Open win.
148	148	23	23	target: Spieth 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keep an eye on this and we will have updates on our Twitter account. Core Players  Jon Rahm ($10,700) – Taking Rahm over Spieth this week isn’t even a tough decision for me this week with pricing aside. Rahm is playing really well even though he missed some par putts at WGC last week, I almost like that he is getting experience in the spotlight and pressure situations.

327	327	11	12	target: Russell Knox 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			A T14 at last year's Wyndham doesn't hurt the perception, either. Russell Knox … If he owned a record better than one cut made (T37, 2012) in two appearances, I wouldn't talk you out of him. However, he went from putting beautifully on the bentgrass at Firestone en route to a T5 to missing the cut on Bermuda at Quail Hollow.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.

7118	7118	21	22	target: Sergio Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Each of the Top 50 players in the world will be teeing off. Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Jason Day, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Alex Noren, and Rickie Fowler enter play as the World’s Top 10, followed closely by US Open champion Brooks Koepka. They’re joined by a slew of qualifiers from around the world and a bunch of past champions.
8532	8532	3	3	target: Henry 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hot. Punting  JJ Henry $6,600  This is an interesting week because we don’t have any course history and really no clue what the keys are to this golf course. If you can make yourself scale back I would as there are a lot of unknowns.
2696	2696	22	23	target: Jim Furyk 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Bud Cauley at 150/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – very nice debut here five years back and ready to improve upon it  1pt e.w. Jim Furyk at 80/1 (1/4 1,2,3,4,5) – former champion can’t be ruled out now the rust is shaken off  1pt e.w. Russell Henley at 80/1 (1/5 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) – two-time Florida winner who should really like this course  1pt e.w.
3118	3118	18	18	target: DeLaet. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Two-man gamers are also advised to keep it simple. Consider going with any combination of McDowell, List and DeLaet. Other choices in whom I'm most confident to reach the weekend include Poulter, Nick Taylor and David Hearn.
108	108	23	24	target: Rickie Fowler. 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Fowler wasn’t totally pleased with his showing there, but this is a good chance for him to get back in the winner’s circle. Rickie Fowler. The Jupiter, Fla. resident is at home at PGA National, has had a few weeks off since finishing T-4 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open and looked really good the last time we saw him.
94	94	48	49	target: Jimmy Walker 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Webb Simpson should also be on your GPP radar this week after his performance last week and oddly enough he holds a solid stroke gained putting resume here at Pebble and we all know how solid his tee to green game is. FADE: After back to back MC Jimmy Walker is trying to lure me into rostering him this week with his elite course history (he even won the last nasty weather edition of this event). I'm not falling for it, and you shouldn't either!
13454	13454	22	23	target: J.B. Holmes. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Again, it'll be a close eye and nothing more from me. As such there are just two more outright selections, starting with J.B. Holmes. Since upsetting the world - myself included - with his snail-like fourth place in the Farmers Insurance Open, Holmes appears to have gone off the boil a little but he's making cuts and everything in the bag has been working nicely except for a troublesome putter.
10976	10976	22	23	target: Jason Kokrak 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A very talented player with the gumption to contend in a big by event like this, Ollie rocks a ton of upside. Jason Kokrak ($7.5K) – Jason Kokrak and consistency are rarely found in the same sentence, but here we are, talking about it anyway. Kokrak has shown well his past four outings, making the cut in all of them and flashing on a leaderboard at some point in the week.
5039	5039	40	41	target: Matt Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			From a setup perspective, we notice six par 4 over 450 yards so that is a nice bucket we can hone in on. Golfers that score well from this range: Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Steve Stricker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Bubba Watson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Jason Day and William McGirt. From a DraftKings point-of-view, golfers with the best birdie-or-better percentage from this range (since start of 2015): Ollie Schniederjans, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Grayson Murray, Stewart Cink, and Hideki Matsuyama.
2352	2352	23	23	target: Scott 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Scott has finished no worse than 14th in his last four events and is fresh off an impressive performance at the Genesis Open. Scott is 10th in scoring average, sixth in birdie average and fourth in sand save percentage. There’s also the fact Scott won the Honda Classic last season with a -9 to par, the best showing at this event since Rory McIlroy won in 2012.
10522	10522	10	11	target: Austin Cook 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Will know the ins and out of these green complexes. Austin Cook ($10,00): Proving to be a consistent week-to-week performer. He's still a plug-and-play for me, anytime he's at or below average salary.
608	608	2	2	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			#RBCHeritage Picks Hatton +2500 Kisner +2800 Fitzpatrick +3300 Dufner +4000 Bryan +6600 RCB +6600
353	353	2	3	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates. Both though need to show form and fast.
2783	2783	29	29	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice. With his history in Palm Harbor, I’ll throw a few pennies on Choi this week.
1905	1905	44	45	target: Matt Kuchar 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm neutral on him, so don't let me put you off, but at $12 million I would want him to be playing Augusta or Colonial rather than Pebble Beach. $7million to $10m Salary Players :  Positive : I have already discussed Adam Hadwin ($7.3m), Matt Kuchar ($8.6m) and Justin Rose ($9.2m). Jim Furyk ($7.5m) is hardly likely to disappoint either.
8879	8879	8	8	target: Garnett 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			This makes him a potential GPP fade. Brice Garnett – GPP – DK: $7600  The leading money winner among Web.com tour graduate has shown to have a knack of finishing near the top of leaderboards this season. In his last 10 starts Garnett has been red hot with two wins and seven finishes inside of the top 20.
4077	4077	12	12	target: Spaun 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make sure List make your list among value plays this week. JJ Spaun $7,800 – Spaun is a Web.com graduate, making a huge impact on the PGA Tour in his first season. He gains strokes off the tee and makes a ton of birdies.
538	538	17	17	target: Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			@ShellHouOpen Picks Fowler +1600 Holmes +3300 Berger +4000 Finau +4000 Rafa +5500 Wood +15000 ------ Cauley +15000 Reed +4500
2660	2660	34	35	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Baltusrol hadn’t been used in over 10 years and the top finishers there were Jimmy Walker, Day, Daniel Summerhays, Branden Grace, Brooks Koepka and Hideki Matsuyama. I’d point out that T-7 were Martin Kaymer, Henrik Stenson and Robert Streb. Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are the winners at Crooked Stick in the only two times the Indiana course was used for the BMW.
830	830	1	2	target: Henrik Stenson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			$8,800 Henrik Stenson at the Players https://t.co/TuqRr1Hxxn
8138	8138	11	12	target: Zach Johnson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Jordan L. Smith $6,500 – Coming off a Euro Tour win. Zach Johnson $6,800 – Super low price for a guy of his pedigree. He proved last week that he can compete on longer courses.
8441	8441	14	15	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Incoming form of winners since 2010 :  Patrick Reed: 22nd Wyndham/11th Olympic/11th Travelers/13th PGA. Jason Day: 1st PGA/12th Bridgestone/1st Canada/4th Open. Hunter Mahan: 7th PGA/15th Bridgestone/MC Canada/32nd Open.
2782	2782	9	9	target: Choi 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Choi is coming with odds of +17500 this week. Choi has missed the cut in six of his eight events this season, and he’s ranked 210 in driving distance and 178 in scoring average. The good news with Choi is that he’s coming off his best performance yet with a top-20 finish at the Genesis Open, and he’s one of two players to win this event twice.
6292	6292	15	16	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's even 19th on Tour in accuracy off the tee and 10th in bogey avoidance. Patrick Reed - $11,100 (12-1)    Reed has been rising for weeks. Sure, there's no guarantee that the arrow will continue to point upward every week, but we like his chances.
5201	5201	11	12	target: Jason Day: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Bump and Run  Choke up and take a narrow stance. Jason Day: Day hasn’t played particularly well at Muirfield Village, finishing outside the top 25 in each of his seven appearances here since 2009 with two missed cuts. That said, he was rounding into form his last time out at the Byron Nelson.
9487	9487	43	43	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I believe we’re going to see more of the same out of Hahn this year. MAJOR WINNER PREDICTIONS  The Masters – Dustin Johnson  I called him last year, he fell down some stairs, so I’m giving myself a retry and calling him again. DJ has all of the tools to make Augusta his absolute bitch in the way that Bubba did – twice.
602	602	38	39	target: Dustin Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Course History  East Lake GC has been the every-year host of this event since 2004, so we have a solid amount of course history to work with this week. Due to the 30-player field, only three players — Dustin Johnson, Jason Day, and Justin Rose — have finished among the top 10 at least three times since 2011. Rose is the only player who has three top-five finishes in the last five years.
1466	1466	8	8	target: Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Never thought about this angle but love it. Day + Spieth bump https://t.co/13dTA4g6HP
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
1122	1122	7	8	target: Bubba Watson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Make it back-to-back crowns for Mr. Mayor. Bubba Watson. I’ll go with the defending champion.
10760	10760	42	42	target: Grace 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I’m still under the impression that McIlroy at his best is better than anyone else at their best, and at a birdie-fest event like this, I want all the Rory I can get. Tournament Pivots to Consider: Jordan Spieth  Mid-Tier Targets  Brenden Grace $9,100  Grace is a guy to look at for pairing with one of the $10,000-and-over players. Like McIlroy, he doesn’t typically play this event, but in theory his game should be a nice fit for Pebble Beach.
5784	5784	173	174	target: Brooks Koepka 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Sergio Garcia won the first major of 2017 at The Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff. Here’s a look at recent US Open winners and their consensus pre-tournament odds to win:  Year Player Odds to Win 2016 Dustin Johnson +1300 2015 Jordan Spieth +800 2014 Martin Kaymer +4000 2013 Justin Rose +2500 2012 Webb Simpson +5000 2011 Rory McIlroy +1400 2010 Graeme McDowell +8000 2009 Lucas Glover +25000 2008 Tiger Woods +170 2007 Angel Cabrera +20000 2006 Geoff Ogilvy +8000 2005 Michael Campbell +50000 2004 Retief Goosen +15000 2003 Jim Furyk +3300  And here are updated odds to win the 2017 US Open at 5Dimes and Bovada:  Golfer April 17, 2017  (5Dimes) Jan 9, 2017  (Bovada) Dustin Johnson +700 +900 Rory McIlroy +800 +800 Jordan Spieth +1000 +1000 Jason Day +1200 +800 Hideki Matsuyama +1600 +2000 Justin Rose +1600 +2200 Sergio Garcia +2000 +4000 Henrik Stenson +2200 +2500 Adam Scott +2800 +2800 Rickie Fowler +2800 +2800 Jon Rahm +2800 N/A Justin Thomas +3300 +6600 Phil Mickelson +3300 +2800 Branden Grace +4000 +4000 Brooks Koepka +4000 +4000 Patrick Reed +4000 +4000 Thomas Pieters +4000 N/A Bubba Watson +5000 +4500 Danny Willett +5000 +5500 Louis Oosthuizen +5000 +5500 Matt Kuchar +5000 +5000 Paul Casey +5000 +6600 Tiger Woods +5000 +2500 Brandt Snedeker +6600 +6600 Charl Schwartzel +6600 +7500 Daniel Berger +6600 +6600 Jim Furyk +6600 +6600 Martin Kaymer +6600 +6600 Byeong-Hun An +8000 +12500 Jimmy Walker +8000 +8000 Lee Westwood +8000 +9000 Matthew Fitzpatrick +8000 +9000 Shane Lowry +8000 +10000 Zach Johnson +8000 +7500 Charley Hoffman +10000 +12500 J.B.

Despite missing out on the first major, he’s still the +700 favorite to win the US Open this year, followed by McIlroy, Spieth, and Day.
1805	1805	25	25	target: Bubba 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
7361	7361	48	49	target: Henrik Stenson. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I'm not convinced by some of the market leaders so the path is clearer than it might have been for the Spaniard, who simply adores playing in this event and now has the added glow of being a major champion. I'll also make the same aggressive play with Henrik Stenson. His four top 10s in this event were actually all top threes so when he's on, he's really on.
293	293	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2016 Deutsche Bank Championship top 10 picks  1. Jason Day -- Day has four top-15 finishes in this event in the last five years. He loves the course and is a putting demon.
5487	5487	25	25	target: DJ 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is bidding to become the first U.S. Open champion to successfully defend his title since Curtis Strange in 1989. Does DJ get it done?
1719	1719	1	1	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Mexico Fleetwood 16 Garcia 28 Cantlay 33 Hatton 45 No bombs this week. Maybe some top 10s later. But I’m sticking near the top here.
10954	10954	39	40	target: Paul Casey, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Targeting a multitude of mid-tier golfers might be a better choice, as strong plays like Branden Grace, Tommy Fleetwood, Alex Noren and Marc Leishman can all be had for less than $10,000. Other strong targets for this format include Paul Casey, Branden Steele, Ollie Schniederjans, Martin Kaymer, Charles Howell III, Martin Laird and Brandon Harkins. Tournaments – It feels like a week where Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth could easily go under-owned due to poor recent form or poor course history.
1805	1805	25	26	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			For me, I can definitely see Rahm winning back-to-back tournaments, so I am pushing all of my Rahm chips to the middle of the table. Bubba Watson – $8,300  Even though Bubba Watson has publically admitted he does not like the TPC Stadium course and only plays here because his sponsors make him – he is a course horse. Bubba’s last five trips to Scottsdale are all top 15 finishes, with two runner ups and a T5.
2528	2528	47	47	target: Fleetwood 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			The Southport man is back where he belongs following a difficult couple of years and in many ways reminds me of Willett, who placed in this event last year before going on to win the Masters, having started the season with a victory in the Middle East. Fleetwood beat a field including Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson to land the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and while that event does tend to see the favourites come up short on what’s typically their first start in months, this year’s winner is good enough to use victory as a springboard. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his run of weekends ended after that triumph – a dip we often see from winners – but he was flushing it again in Malaysia last time.
7323	7323	35	35	target: Harrington 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Arnold Palmer won in 1961, as did Johnny Miller in 1976 and Tom Watson in 1983. But the Open has been contested at Birkdale only three times since Watson's win, most recently 2008, when Padraig Harrington successfully defended his title. That tournament was dominated by weather, both wind and rain, leaving Harrington with the winning score of 3-over, by far the highest in the nine Birkdale Opens.
5360	5360	38	38	target: Fowler, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Much like TPC Sawgrass, saving par from tricky greenside Bermuda is no walk in the park, so make sure your selections have some short game skills on this “sticky” strain of grass. FanDuel Value Picks    The Chalk    Rickie Fowler, $10500 – Fowler is enjoying a great season that includes a win at the Honda Classic and a runner-up at last week’s Memorial Tournament. While this track doesn’t have any ties to Jack Nicklaus, it’s a good fit for Rickie in a diluted field.
1454	1454	28	29	target: Patrick Reed 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Still meaningful, but you want to target birdie-makers above all else in that format. Just three of the world’s top 30 are making the trek to La Quinta: Patrick Reed (9), Phil Mickelson (21), and Emiliano Grillo (25). Where the Sony Open sported incredible depth past the top tier of players, the Careerbuilder does not.
5622	5622	12	12	target: Casey’s 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Most approaches will have the ball beyond 15’ from the hole, so Casey’s consistent two-putt skill will come in handy. If his putter can get hot – and it’s actually been not bad on bentgrass – Casey can compete here and challenge for the US Open Trophy. Adam Scott ($8800) – The combination of Casey and Scott will make it very hard to use one of the elite tier golfers, but Scott is very similar to Casey with his excellent ball-striking, steadiness off the tee, and low launch angle and makes a nice lower-owned play.
3679	3679	26	27	target: Tyrrell Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			As mentioned above, that puts a premium on players with low ball flight – even with the current forecast being fairly mild. The Golfers  The Core  Tyrrell Hatton ($9300): After ruining a lot of lineups last week, Tyrrell Hatton got an extra two days off to regroup, and to hopefully keep his ownership down at RBC Heritage this week. Hatton makes an interesting bounce-back option here, much in the same way Branden Grace missed the cut last year just to come back and win; Hatton’s one of the best players in the field on approach (7th on Tour in SG:App), but has struggled putting the ball on the green in regulation which is a fairly big knock on him.
6966	6966	92	93	target: Scott Stallings; 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by SERVPRO  My roster for the John Deere Classic (in alphabetical order):  Daniel Berger  Chad Campbell  Brian Harman  Charley Hoffman  Ryan Moore  Kyle Stanley  You’ll find my starters in Expert Picks. Others to consider for each category (in alphabetical order):  Scoring: Charles Howell III; Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Kelly Kraft; Danny Lee; Trey Mullinax; Sebastian Muñoz; Kevin Na  Driving: Zach Johnson; Matt Jones; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; William McGirt; Rory Sabbatini; Kevin Streelman  Approach: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Kevin Na; Chez Reavie; Rory Sabbatini; Scott Stallings; Steve Stricker; Nick Watney  Short: Charles Howell III; Kevin Kisner; Danny Lee; Sebastian Muñoz; Chez Reavie; Steve Stricker  Power Rankings Wild Card  Nick Taylor … Not unlike how Kyle Stanley didn't surprise gamers at the Quicken Loans National, Taylor's T9 at The Greenbrier Classic aligned with his arc on which he's climbed from outside the top 400 in the Official World Golf Ranking in February to his current position at 188th. He didn't crack the Power Rankings for the John Deere Classic primarily due to the fact that he's 0-for-2 at TPC Deere Run, but expect that record to reflect success at the conclusion of this weekend with the kind of balanced attack he's maintained all year.
5511	5511	62	63	target: Jason Day. 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've seen one or two surprise winners of the US Open but five of the last six winners have been ranked inside the top-15 of the Official World Rankings, so the cream usually rises to the top. Event specialists appear on the leaderboard year after year and so, with an exceptional US Open CV, I like the chances of world number three, Jason Day. The 29-year-old Aussie won the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straights in 2015, a course that some have compared to this week's venue, Erin Hills, and now that rain is in the forecast, Day has the length off the tee to cope with such a long course in damp conditions.
5879	5879	17	18	target: Bubba Watson 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			At 6,841 yards the course is attackable and gives all styles of play a chance of victory. Bubba Watson averaged 320 yards off the tee across his two victories here whilst defending champion Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, Ken Duke and Freddie Jacobson plotted and putted their ways to victory. However River Highlands has seen significant changes since the 2015 renewal with 50 bunkers removed and the remaining bunkers being upgraded and in many cases moved to create fairway pinch points.
8526	8526	15	16	target: Henrik Stenson, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			2017 Northern Trust Open DFS Preview  Hello Degens! Last week we hit the winner in Henrik Stenson, but the picks otherwise were very blah. Listen to Always Pressing Pod for some further analysis on what happened to me (if you care, if not all good).
1795	1795	21	22	target: Keegan Bradley 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			We've had bad luck with players coming off long layoffs, but we trust Kooch to finish in the money this week. Keegan Bradley ($7,400)  Bradley seems to be rounding back into form after a long time in the golf wilderness. He's coming off a T4 at the Farmers, his best showing on Tour in two years.
5502	5502	41	42	target: Jason Day, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			A recent switch in putters has seen him find his touch on the greens but he's been a bit ragged at times and this is a long course for him given he only ranks 86th for Driving Distance. World number three, Jason Day, has an excellent record in this tournament and he's the one I like best at the head of the market. A health scare for his mother derailed his season a few months ago but he arrives at Erin Hills in decent form.

172	172	3	4	target: Tony Finau 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Keegan Bradley  12. Tony Finau  13. Ryan Moore  14.
237	237	2	2	target: Johnson, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			2. Zach Johnson, $8,300  Johnson has played this event each of the last six years and has finished 47th or worse four times. His best finishes during that span are a sixth in 2015 and a 24th in 2011.
3471	3471	2	2	target: Kuchar, 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			3. Matt Kuchar, $7,400  One of the best golfers to never win a major, Kuchar has given himself the best chance at the Masters. He’s made the cut in each of the last seven years, finishing inside the top-8 three times and inside the top-30 six times.
1010	1010	5	7	target: Charles Howell III 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Chris Kirk - $11,300  2. Charles Howell III - $9,200  3. Cody Gribble - $8,400  4.
8819	8819	38	38	target: Spieth' 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Back him win only at 9/2. In a week where a player can walk off with two trophies if everything goes their way, it's also possible to land a double win as a punter thanks to Betfair's 'W/O Spieth' market. My dream scenario therefore is a Spieth win, with Justin Rose finishing runner-up.

4567	4567	8	9	target: Jason Day 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Perfect Pivots  Identifying the chalk, and going elsewhere. Jason Day – $10,000  The defending champ is a Perfect Pivot? It sure looks like it.
1658	1658	1	1	target: Hatton 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Love Hatton this week. Don't love that I saw that Hatton pulled out of his last event with a wrist injury. Hope he's OK.
1699	1699	19	19	target: Finau 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Hopped on what will likely be the only two outrights above 20 I'll be on this week: Cantlay 33/1 Finau 50/1
219	219	29	29	target: JT, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Charl defiitely stands out as a golfer who could be affected by the clustered ownership I mentioned above, so don’t look for Charl’s price to go unnoticed. Contrary to JT, Charl seems to have the game that fits this course to the ‘T’ and his course history paints the same picture. With six made cuts in his last six tries, four top twenty finishes, and two top tens Charl has some of the best course history in the field, and as such I’ll be playing him in all formats.
997	997	13	13	target: Haas 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			He's got top-20s in his two fall starts, including T4 at the WGC-HSBC. Haas has managed only a T33 and T22 the past two years here, though he was runner-up in 2010. His price may be a bit high, but it's surely more favorable to us than Matt Kuchar's $11,200 or Brandt Snedeker's $10,900.
3088	3088	23	23	target: Brown 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Brown's form has regressed tremendously since he popped at the Genesis with a second-place finish. The thing is, we've seen this out of Brown in the past and he's proven year after year that his form means little when coming to this event. It's difficult to get comfortable at this price, but you'll need to put that recency bias away this week if you plan on rostering him this week.
278	278	4	4	target: Mickelson 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			Lefty I will, though. Mickelson hasn’t missed a cut this year, was T-19 at Birkdale in 2008 and produced a stunning runner-up performance last year at the Open. So why pick against him?
3261	3261	23	24	target: Kyle Reifers: 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Vegas is 29th on Tour in greens in regulation and 34th in strokes gained: tee-to-green, indicating the quality of his ballstriking. Throwing Darts  Kyle Reifers: $6,600  Hopefully Reifers found something in Puerto Rico, where he tied for 17th at 14 under. He tied for seventh at the SHO last year, so recency in both season play and course history make him a worthy punt.
4720	4720	2	2	target: Lahiri 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			Yes. However, Lahiri is a contender and is a guy in this range we could see winning the AT&T. Obviously, he had something going right that day to be -6 on his round at TPC.
352	352	24	25	target: Daniel Berger 	[Error] Initial: positive	Result: negative			I need a victory or I need at least a couple second-place finishes to get into the top 5 at East Lake." RESULT: MC  Daniel Berger 1pt EW 80/1 with Get a £20 free bet via this link plus 6 places each way:  Daniel Berger is the sort who I think could force himself into Davis Love III's plans . It's known that Davis would love to add a young talent to the team and in Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger we have the only real candidates.
212	212	51	51	target: Garcia, 	[Error] Initial: negative	Result: positive			  THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP    Purse: $10.5M  Winner's Share: $1.89M  FedEx Cup Points: 600 to the Winner  Location: Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
